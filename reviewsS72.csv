1.0 out of 5 stars,"SO! After NOT getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my PLAIN cardboard box this phone came in, I took it back to Jamaica where my ""GSM Unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (Meaning it is not unlocked). I have bought GSM unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in Jamaica, but not this one. After requesting an unlock code from AT&T, only to be told that ""This device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".I want all of my money back, and I deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my wife's Galaxy S7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  Our carrier required an unlocked GSM phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""Verizon"" on the back).  The phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later I got the SIM card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""Processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).After about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * THAT WAS THE PROBLEM! *  Once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"DO NOT BOTHER BUYING ONE OF THESE! THEY OBVIOUSLY DO NOT INSPECT THEM PROPERLY IF I WAS ABLE TO NOTICE A VERY OBVIOUS SCREEN DEFECT WITHING A FEW HOURS OF OWNING THE PHONE! THEY SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT THAT AND NEVER TRIED TO PASS THIS PHONE OFF ON ANYONE!  The first day I got the phone I noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. I did not notice this until I already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so I figured I would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. It proved to be extremely annoying. After a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. It is infuriating because now I won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. This whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and I greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, was indeed unlocked. I use it with my Ultra sim card with no issues. It came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which I didn't read of course:). The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. Fast delivery. P.S. I bought from store BuySpry.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My real rating would be about 3.75 stars if I could give that.  I used the phone for a week before writing this review.  The ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  Not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the Home Key and the trim at the top.  They aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so I don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  I'm also a little concerned that the USB port is worn.  It doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  So far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  Switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  I'm with AT&T, moving up from an S5.  I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"DO NOT BOTHER BUYING ONE OF THESE! THEY OBVIOUSLY DO NOT INSPECT THEM PROPERLY IF I WAS ABLE TO NOTICE A VERY OBVIOUS SCREEN DEFECT WITHING A FEW HOURS OF OWNING THE PHONE! THEY SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT THAT AND NEVER TRIED TO PASS THIS PHONE OFF ON ANYONE!  The first day I got the phone I noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. I did not notice this until I already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so I figured I would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. It proved to be extremely annoying. After a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. It is infuriating because now I won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. This whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and I greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, was indeed unlocked. I use it with my Ultra sim card with no issues. It came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which I didn't read of course:). The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. Fast delivery. P.S. I bought from store BuySpry.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My real rating would be about 3.75 stars if I could give that.  I used the phone for a week before writing this review.  The ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  Not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the Home Key and the trim at the top.  They aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so I don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  I'm also a little concerned that the USB port is worn.  It doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  So far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  Switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  I'm with AT&T, moving up from an S5.  I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"SO! After NOT getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my PLAIN cardboard box this phone came in, I took it back to Jamaica where my ""GSM Unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (Meaning it is not unlocked). I have bought GSM unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in Jamaica, but not this one. After requesting an unlock code from AT&T, only to be told that ""This device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".I want all of my money back, and I deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my wife's Galaxy S7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  Our carrier required an unlocked GSM phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""Verizon"" on the back).  The phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later I got the SIM card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""Processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).After about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * THAT WAS THE PROBLEM! *  Once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.

He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"SO! After NOT getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my PLAIN cardboard box this phone came in, I took it back to Jamaica where my ""GSM Unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (Meaning it is not unlocked). I have bought GSM unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in Jamaica, but not this one. After requesting an unlock code from AT&T, only to be told that ""This device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".I want all of my money back, and I deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my wife's Galaxy S7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  Our carrier required an unlocked GSM phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""Verizon"" on the back).  The phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later I got the SIM card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""Processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).After about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * THAT WAS THE PROBLEM! *  Once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, was indeed unlocked. I use it with my Ultra sim card with no issues. It came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which I didn't read of course:). The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok.

Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"SO! After NOT getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my PLAIN cardboard box this phone came in, I took it back to Jamaica where my ""GSM Unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (Meaning it is not unlocked). I have bought GSM unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in Jamaica, but not this one. After requesting an unlock code from AT&T, only to be told that ""This device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".I want all of my money back, and I deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my wife's Galaxy S7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  Our carrier required an unlocked GSM phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""Verizon"" on the back).  The phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later I got the SIM card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""Processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).After about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * THAT WAS THE PROBLEM! *  Once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"DO NOT BOTHER BUYING ONE OF THESE! THEY OBVIOUSLY DO NOT INSPECT THEM PROPERLY IF I WAS ABLE TO NOTICE A VERY OBVIOUS SCREEN DEFECT WITHING A FEW HOURS OF OWNING THE PHONE!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, was indeed unlocked. I use it with my Ultra sim card with no issues. It came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which I didn't read of course:). The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. Fast delivery. P.S. I bought from store BuySpry.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My real rating would be about 3.75 stars if I could give that.  I used the phone for a week before writing this review.  The ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  Not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the Home Key and the trim at the top.  They aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so I don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  I'm also a little concerned that the USB port is worn.  It doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  So far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  Switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  I'm with AT&T, moving up from an S5.  I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).

The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, was indeed unlocked. I use it with my Ultra sim card with no issues. It came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which I didn't read of course:). The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. Fast delivery. P.S. I bought from store BuySpry.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My real rating would be about 3.75 stars if I could give that.  I used the phone for a week before writing this review.  The ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  Not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the Home Key and the trim at the top.  They aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so I don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  I'm also a little concerned that the USB port is worn.  It doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  So far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  Switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  I'm with AT&T, moving up from an S5.  I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"SO! After NOT getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my PLAIN cardboard box this phone came in, I took it back to Jamaica where my ""GSM Unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (Meaning it is not unlocked). I have bought GSM unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in Jamaica, but not this one. After requesting an unlock code from AT&T, only to be told that ""This device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".I want all of my money back, and I deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my wife's Galaxy S7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  Our carrier required an unlocked GSM phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""Verizon"" on the back).  The phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later I got the SIM card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""Processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).After about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * THAT WAS THE PROBLEM! *  Once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, was indeed unlocked. I use it with my Ultra sim card with no issues. It came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which I didn't read of course:). The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. Fast delivery. P.S. I bought from store BuySpry.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My real rating would be about 3.75 stars if I could give that.  I used the phone for a week before writing this review.  The ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  Not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the Home Key and the trim at the top.  They aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so I don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  I'm also a little concerned that the USB port is worn.  It doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  So far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  Switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  I'm with AT&T, moving up from an S5.  I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"SO! After NOT getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my PLAIN cardboard box this phone came in, I took it back to Jamaica where my ""GSM Unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (Meaning it is not unlocked). I have bought GSM unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in Jamaica, but not this one. After requesting an unlock code from AT&T, only to be told that ""This device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".I want all of my money back, and I deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my wife's Galaxy S7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  Our carrier required an unlocked GSM phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""Verizon"" on the back).  The phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later I got the SIM card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""Processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).After about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * THAT WAS THE PROBLEM! *  Once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

So far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  Switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  I'm with AT&T, moving up from an S5.  I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"SO! After NOT getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my PLAIN cardboard box this phone came in, I took it back to Jamaica where my ""GSM Unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (Meaning it is not unlocked). I have bought GSM unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in Jamaica, but not this one. After requesting an unlock code from AT&T, only to be told that ""This device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".I want all of my money back, and I deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my wife's Galaxy S7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  Our carrier required an unlocked GSM phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""Verizon"" on the back).  The phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later I got the SIM card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""Processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).After about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * THAT WAS THE PROBLEM! *  Once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, was indeed unlocked. I use it with my Ultra sim card with no issues. It came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which I didn't read of course:). The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok.

The phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later I got the SIM card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""Processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).After about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * THAT WAS THE PROBLEM! *  Once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, was indeed unlocked. I use it with my Ultra sim card with no issues. It came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which I didn't read of course:). The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. Fast delivery. P.S. I bought from store BuySpry.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My real rating would be about 3.75 stars if I could give that.  I used the phone for a week before writing this review.  The ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  Not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the Home Key and the trim at the top.  They aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so I don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  I'm also a little concerned that the USB port is worn.  It doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  So far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  Switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  I'm with AT&T, moving up from an S5.  I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"DO NOT BOTHER BUYING ONE OF THESE! THEY OBVIOUSLY DO NOT INSPECT THEM PROPERLY IF I WAS ABLE TO NOTICE A VERY OBVIOUS SCREEN DEFECT WITHING A FEW HOURS OF OWNING THE PHONE! THEY SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT THAT AND NEVER TRIED TO PASS THIS PHONE OFF ON ANYONE!  The first day I got the phone I noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. I did not notice this until I already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so I figured I would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. It proved to be extremely annoying. After a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. It is infuriating because now I won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. This whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and I greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, was indeed unlocked. I use it with my Ultra sim card with no issues. It came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which I didn't read of course:). The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. Fast delivery. P.S. I bought from store BuySpry.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My real rating would be about 3.75 stars if I could give that.  I used the phone for a week before writing this review.  The ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  Not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the Home Key and the trim at the top.  They aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so I don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  I'm also a little concerned that the USB port is worn.  It doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  So far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  Switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  I'm with AT&T, moving up from an S5.  I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"SO! After NOT getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my PLAIN cardboard box this phone came in, I took it back to Jamaica where my ""GSM Unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (Meaning it is not unlocked). I have bought GSM unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in Jamaica, but not this one. After requesting an unlock code from AT&T, only to be told that ""This device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".I want all of my money back, and I deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my wife's Galaxy S7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  Our carrier required an unlocked GSM phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""Verizon"" on the back).  The phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later I got the SIM card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""Processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).After about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * THAT WAS THE PROBLEM! *  Once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. Fast delivery. P.S. I bought from store BuySpry.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My real rating would be about 3.75 stars if I could give that.  I used the phone for a week before writing this review.  The ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  Not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the Home Key and the trim at the top.  They aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so I don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  I'm also a little concerned that the USB port is worn.  It doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  So far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  Switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  I'm with AT&T, moving up from an S5.  I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

After requesting an unlock code from AT&T, only to be told that ""This device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".I want all of my money back, and I deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my wife's Galaxy S7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  Our carrier required an unlocked GSM phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""Verizon"" on the back).  The phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later I got the SIM card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""Processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).After about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * THAT WAS THE PROBLEM! *  Once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, was indeed unlocked. I use it with my Ultra sim card with no issues. It came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which I didn't read of course:). The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. Fast delivery. P.S. I bought from store BuySpry.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My real rating would be about 3.75 stars if I could give that.  I used the phone for a week before writing this review.  The ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  Not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the Home Key and the trim at the top.  They aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so I don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  I'm also a little concerned that the USB port is worn.  It doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  So far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  Switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  I'm with AT&T, moving up from an S5.  I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, was indeed unlocked. I use it with my Ultra sim card with no issues. It came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which I didn't read of course:). The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. Fast delivery. P.S. I bought from store BuySpry.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My real rating would be about 3.75 stars if I could give that.  I used the phone for a week before writing this review.  The ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  Not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the Home Key and the trim at the top.  They aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so I don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  I'm also a little concerned that the USB port is worn.  It doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  So far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  Switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  I'm with AT&T, moving up from an S5.  I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"SO! After NOT getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my PLAIN cardboard box this phone came in, I took it back to Jamaica where my ""GSM Unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (Meaning it is not unlocked). I have bought GSM unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in Jamaica, but not this one. After requesting an unlock code from AT&T, only to be told that ""This device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".I want all of my money back, and I deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my wife's Galaxy S7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  Our carrier required an unlocked GSM phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""Verizon"" on the back).  The phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later I got the SIM card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""Processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).After about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * THAT WAS THE PROBLEM! *  Once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.

The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. Fast delivery. P.S. I bought from store BuySpry.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My real rating would be about 3.75 stars if I could give that.  I used the phone for a week before writing this review.  The ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  Not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the Home Key and the trim at the top.  They aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so I don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  I'm also a little concerned that the USB port is worn.  It doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  So far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  Switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  I'm with AT&T, moving up from an S5.  I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"SO! After NOT getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my PLAIN cardboard box this phone came in, I took it back to Jamaica where my ""GSM Unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (Meaning it is not unlocked). I have bought GSM unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in Jamaica, but not this one. After requesting an unlock code from AT&T, only to be told that ""This device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".I want all of my money back, and I deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my wife's Galaxy S7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  Our carrier required an unlocked GSM phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""Verizon"" on the back).  The phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later I got the SIM card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""Processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).After about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * THAT WAS THE PROBLEM! *  Once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"DO NOT BOTHER BUYING ONE OF THESE! THEY OBVIOUSLY DO NOT INSPECT THEM PROPERLY IF I WAS ABLE TO NOTICE A VERY OBVIOUS SCREEN DEFECT WITHING A FEW HOURS OF OWNING THE PHONE! THEY SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT THAT AND NEVER TRIED TO PASS THIS PHONE OFF ON ANYONE!  The first day I got the phone I noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. I did not notice this until I already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so I figured I would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. It proved to be extremely annoying. After a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. It is infuriating because now I won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone.

Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my wife's Galaxy S7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  Our carrier required an unlocked GSM phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""Verizon"" on the back).  The phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later I got the SIM card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""Processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).After about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * THAT WAS THE PROBLEM! *  Once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"SO! After NOT getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my PLAIN cardboard box this phone came in, I took it back to Jamaica where my ""GSM Unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (Meaning it is not unlocked). I have bought GSM unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in Jamaica, but not this one. After requesting an unlock code from AT&T, only to be told that ""This device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".I want all of my money back, and I deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, was indeed unlocked. I use it with my Ultra sim card with no issues. It came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which I didn't read of course:). The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok.

I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, was indeed unlocked. I use it with my Ultra sim card with no issues. It came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which I didn't read of course:). The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. Fast delivery. P.S. I bought from store BuySpry.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My real rating would be about 3.75 stars if I could give that.  I used the phone for a week before writing this review.  The ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  Not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the Home Key and the trim at the top.  They aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so I don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  I'm also a little concerned that the USB port is worn.  It doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  So far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  Switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  I'm with AT&T, moving up from an S5.  I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, was indeed unlocked. I use it with my Ultra sim card with no issues. It came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which I didn't read of course:). The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. Fast delivery. P.S. I bought from store BuySpry.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My real rating would be about 3.75 stars if I could give that.  I used the phone for a week before writing this review.  The ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  Not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the Home Key and the trim at the top.  They aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so I don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  I'm also a little concerned that the USB port is worn.  It doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  So far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  Switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  I'm with AT&T, moving up from an S5.  I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"SO! After NOT getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my PLAIN cardboard box this phone came in, I took it back to Jamaica where my ""GSM Unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (Meaning it is not unlocked). I have bought GSM unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in Jamaica, but not this one. After requesting an unlock code from AT&T, only to be told that ""This device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".I want all of my money back, and I deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my wife's Galaxy S7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  Our carrier required an unlocked GSM phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""Verizon"" on the back).  The phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later I got the SIM card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""Processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).After about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * THAT WAS THE PROBLEM! *  Once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"SO! After NOT getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my PLAIN cardboard box this phone came in, I took it back to Jamaica where my ""GSM Unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (Meaning it is not unlocked). I have bought GSM unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in Jamaica, but not this one. After requesting an unlock code from AT&T, only to be told that ""This device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".I want all of my money back, and I deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my wife's Galaxy S7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  Our carrier required an unlocked GSM phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""Verizon"" on the back).  The phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later I got the SIM card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""Processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).After about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * THAT WAS THE PROBLEM! *  Once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, was indeed unlocked. I use it with my Ultra sim card with no issues. It came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which I didn't read of course:). The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok.

So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"DO NOT BOTHER BUYING ONE OF THESE! THEY OBVIOUSLY DO NOT INSPECT THEM PROPERLY IF I WAS ABLE TO NOTICE A VERY OBVIOUS SCREEN DEFECT WITHING A FEW HOURS OF OWNING THE PHONE! THEY SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT THAT AND NEVER TRIED TO PASS THIS PHONE OFF ON ANYONE!  The first day I got the phone I noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. I did not notice this until I already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so I figured I would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. It proved to be extremely annoying. After a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. It is infuriating because now I won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, was indeed unlocked. I use it with my Ultra sim card with no issues. It came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which I didn't read of course:). The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. Fast delivery. P.S. I bought from store BuySpry.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My real rating would be about 3.75 stars if I could give that.  I used the phone for a week before writing this review.  The ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  Not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the Home Key and the trim at the top.  They aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so I don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  I'm also a little concerned that the USB port is worn.  It doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  So far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  Switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  I'm with AT&T, moving up from an S5.  I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"SO! After NOT getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my PLAIN cardboard box this phone came in, I took it back to Jamaica where my ""GSM Unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (Meaning it is not unlocked). I have bought GSM unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in Jamaica, but not this one. After requesting an unlock code from AT&T, only to be told that ""This device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".I want all of my money back, and I deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"DO NOT BOTHER BUYING ONE OF THESE! THEY OBVIOUSLY DO NOT INSPECT THEM PROPERLY IF I WAS ABLE TO NOTICE A VERY OBVIOUS SCREEN DEFECT WITHING A FEW HOURS OF OWNING THE PHONE!

I did not notice this until I already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so I figured I would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. It proved to be extremely annoying. After a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. It is infuriating because now I won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, was indeed unlocked. I use it with my Ultra sim card with no issues. It came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which I didn't read of course:). The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. Fast delivery. P.S. I bought from store BuySpry.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My real rating would be about 3.75 stars if I could give that.  I used the phone for a week before writing this review.  The ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  Not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the Home Key and the trim at the top.  They aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so I don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  I'm also a little concerned that the USB port is worn.  It doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  So far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  Switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  I'm with AT&T, moving up from an S5.  I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"SO! After NOT getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my PLAIN cardboard box this phone came in, I took it back to Jamaica where my ""GSM Unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (Meaning it is not unlocked). I have bought GSM unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in Jamaica, but not this one. After requesting an unlock code from AT&T, only to be told that ""This device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".I want all of my money back, and I deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my wife's Galaxy S7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  Our carrier required an unlocked GSM phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""Verizon"" on the back).  The phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later I got the SIM card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""Processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).After about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * THAT WAS THE PROBLEM! *  Once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. Fast delivery. P.S. I bought from store BuySpry.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My real rating would be about 3.75 stars if I could give that.  I used the phone for a week before writing this review.  The ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  Not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the Home Key and the trim at the top.  They aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so I don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  I'm also a little concerned that the USB port is worn.  It doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  So far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  Switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  I'm with AT&T, moving up from an S5.  I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

Our carrier required an unlocked GSM phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""Verizon"" on the back).  The phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later I got the SIM card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""Processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).After about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * THAT WAS THE PROBLEM! *  Once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

After requesting an unlock code from AT&T, only to be told that ""This device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".I want all of my money back, and I deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my wife's Galaxy S7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  Our carrier required an unlocked GSM phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""Verizon"" on the back).  The phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later I got the SIM card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""Processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).After about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * THAT WAS THE PROBLEM! *  Once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, was indeed unlocked. I use it with my Ultra sim card with no issues. It came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which I didn't read of course:). The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. Fast delivery. P.S. I bought from store BuySpry.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My real rating would be about 3.75 stars if I could give that.  I used the phone for a week before writing this review.  The ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  Not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the Home Key and the trim at the top.  They aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so I don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  I'm also a little concerned that the USB port is worn.  It doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  So far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  Switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  I'm with AT&T, moving up from an S5.  I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, was indeed unlocked. I use it with my Ultra sim card with no issues. It came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which I didn't read of course:). The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. Fast delivery. P.S. I bought from store BuySpry.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My real rating would be about 3.75 stars if I could give that.  I used the phone for a week before writing this review.  The ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  Not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the Home Key and the trim at the top.  They aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so I don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  I'm also a little concerned that the USB port is worn.  It doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  So far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  Switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  I'm with AT&T, moving up from an S5.  I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"SO! After NOT getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my PLAIN cardboard box this phone came in, I took it back to Jamaica where my ""GSM Unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (Meaning it is not unlocked). I have bought GSM unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in Jamaica, but not this one. After requesting an unlock code from AT&T, only to be told that ""This device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".I want all of my money back, and I deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, was indeed unlocked. I use it with my Ultra sim card with no issues. It came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which I didn't read of course:). The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. Fast delivery. P.S. I bought from store BuySpry.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My real rating would be about 3.75 stars if I could give that.  I used the phone for a week before writing this review.  The ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  Not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the Home Key and the trim at the top.  They aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so I don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  I'm also a little concerned that the USB port is worn.  It doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  So far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  Switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  I'm with AT&T, moving up from an S5.  I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my wife's Galaxy S7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  Our carrier required an unlocked GSM phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""Verizon"" on the back).  The phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later I got the SIM card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""Processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).After about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * THAT WAS THE PROBLEM! *  Once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"SO! After NOT getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my PLAIN cardboard box this phone came in, I took it back to Jamaica where my ""GSM Unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (Meaning it is not unlocked). I have bought GSM unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in Jamaica, but not this one. After requesting an unlock code from AT&T, only to be told that ""This device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".I want all of my money back, and I deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"SO! After NOT getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my PLAIN cardboard box this phone came in, I took it back to Jamaica where my ""GSM Unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (Meaning it is not unlocked). I have bought GSM unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in Jamaica, but not this one. After requesting an unlock code from AT&T, only to be told that ""This device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".I want all of my money back, and I deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my wife's Galaxy S7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  Our carrier required an unlocked GSM phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""Verizon"" on the back).  The phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later I got the SIM card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""Processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).After about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * THAT WAS THE PROBLEM! *  Once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, was indeed unlocked. I use it with my Ultra sim card with no issues. It came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which I didn't read of course:). The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. Fast delivery. P.S. I bought from store BuySpry.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My real rating would be about 3.75 stars if I could give that.  I used the phone for a week before writing this review.  The ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  Not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the Home Key and the trim at the top.  They aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so I don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  I'm also a little concerned that the USB port is worn.  It doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  So far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  Switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  I'm with AT&T, moving up from an S5.  I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).

So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, was indeed unlocked. I use it with my Ultra sim card with no issues. It came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which I didn't read of course:). The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My real rating would be about 3.75 stars if I could give that.  I used the phone for a week before writing this review.  The ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  Not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the Home Key and the trim at the top.  They aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so I don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  I'm also a little concerned that the USB port is worn.  It doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  So far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  Switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  I'm with AT&T, moving up from an S5.  I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, was indeed unlocked. I use it with my Ultra sim card with no issues. It came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which I didn't read of course:). The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. Fast delivery. P.S. I bought from store BuySpry.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My real rating would be about 3.75 stars if I could give that.  I used the phone for a week before writing this review.  The ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  Not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the Home Key and the trim at the top.  They aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so I don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  I'm also a little concerned that the USB port is worn.  It doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  So far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  Switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  I'm with AT&T, moving up from an S5.  I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"SO! After NOT getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my PLAIN cardboard box this phone came in, I took it back to Jamaica where my ""GSM Unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (Meaning it is not unlocked). I have bought GSM unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in Jamaica, but not this one. After requesting an unlock code from AT&T, only to be told that ""This device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".I want all of my money back, and I deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my wife's Galaxy S7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  Our carrier required an unlocked GSM phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""Verizon"" on the back).  The phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later I got the SIM card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""Processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).After about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * THAT WAS THE PROBLEM! *  Once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"SO! After NOT getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my PLAIN cardboard box this phone came in, I took it back to Jamaica where my ""GSM Unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (Meaning it is not unlocked). I have bought GSM unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in Jamaica, but not this one. After requesting an unlock code from AT&T, only to be told that ""This device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".I want all of my money back, and I deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my wife's Galaxy S7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  Our carrier required an unlocked GSM phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""Verizon"" on the back).  The phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later I got the SIM card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""Processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).After about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * THAT WAS THE PROBLEM! *  Once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"DO NOT BOTHER BUYING ONE OF THESE! THEY OBVIOUSLY DO NOT INSPECT THEM PROPERLY IF I WAS ABLE TO NOTICE A VERY OBVIOUS SCREEN DEFECT WITHING A FEW HOURS OF OWNING THE PHONE!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, was indeed unlocked. I use it with my Ultra sim card with no issues. It came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which I didn't read of course:). The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok.

So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"DO NOT BOTHER BUYING ONE OF THESE! THEY OBVIOUSLY DO NOT INSPECT THEM PROPERLY IF I WAS ABLE TO NOTICE A VERY OBVIOUS SCREEN DEFECT WITHING A FEW HOURS OF OWNING THE PHONE! THEY SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT THAT AND NEVER TRIED TO PASS THIS PHONE OFF ON ANYONE!  The first day I got the phone I noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. I did not notice this until I already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so I figured I would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. It proved to be extremely annoying. After a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. It is infuriating because now I won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, was indeed unlocked. I use it with my Ultra sim card with no issues. It came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which I didn't read of course:). The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. Fast delivery. P.S. I bought from store BuySpry.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My real rating would be about 3.75 stars if I could give that.  I used the phone for a week before writing this review.  The ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  Not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the Home Key and the trim at the top.  They aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so I don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  I'm also a little concerned that the USB port is worn.  It doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  So far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  Switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  I'm with AT&T, moving up from an S5.  I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"SO! After NOT getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my PLAIN cardboard box this phone came in, I took it back to Jamaica where my ""GSM Unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (Meaning it is not unlocked). I have bought GSM unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in Jamaica, but not this one. After requesting an unlock code from AT&T, only to be told that ""This device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".I want all of my money back, and I deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"DO NOT BOTHER BUYING ONE OF THESE! THEY OBVIOUSLY DO NOT INSPECT THEM PROPERLY IF I WAS ABLE TO NOTICE A VERY OBVIOUS SCREEN DEFECT WITHING A FEW HOURS OF OWNING THE PHONE!

I did not notice this until I already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so I figured I would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. It proved to be extremely annoying. After a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. It is infuriating because now I won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, was indeed unlocked. I use it with my Ultra sim card with no issues. It came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which I didn't read of course:). The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. Fast delivery. P.S. I bought from store BuySpry.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My real rating would be about 3.75 stars if I could give that.  I used the phone for a week before writing this review.  The ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  Not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the Home Key and the trim at the top.  They aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so I don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  I'm also a little concerned that the USB port is worn.  It doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  So far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  Switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  I'm with AT&T, moving up from an S5.  I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"SO! After NOT getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my PLAIN cardboard box this phone came in, I took it back to Jamaica where my ""GSM Unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (Meaning it is not unlocked). I have bought GSM unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in Jamaica, but not this one. After requesting an unlock code from AT&T, only to be told that ""This device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".I want all of my money back, and I deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my wife's Galaxy S7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  Our carrier required an unlocked GSM phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""Verizon"" on the back).  The phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later I got the SIM card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""Processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).After about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * THAT WAS THE PROBLEM! *  Once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My real rating would be about 3.75 stars if I could give that.  I used the phone for a week before writing this review.  The ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  Not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the Home Key and the trim at the top.  They aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so I don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  I'm also a little concerned that the USB port is worn.  It doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  So far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  Switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  I'm with AT&T, moving up from an S5.  I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"SO! After NOT getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my PLAIN cardboard box this phone came in, I took it back to Jamaica where my ""GSM Unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (Meaning it is not unlocked). I have bought GSM unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in Jamaica, but not this one. After requesting an unlock code from AT&T, only to be told that ""This device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".I want all of my money back, and I deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my wife's Galaxy S7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  Our carrier required an unlocked GSM phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""Verizon"" on the back).  The phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later I got the SIM card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""Processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).After about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * THAT WAS THE PROBLEM! *  Once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, was indeed unlocked. I use it with my Ultra sim card with no issues. It came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which I didn't read of course:). The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my wife's Galaxy S7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  Our carrier required an unlocked GSM phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""Verizon"" on the back).  The phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later I got the SIM card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""Processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).After about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * THAT WAS THE PROBLEM! *  Once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, was indeed unlocked. I use it with my Ultra sim card with no issues. It came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which I didn't read of course:). The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. Fast delivery. P.S. I bought from store BuySpry.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My real rating would be about 3.75 stars if I could give that.  I used the phone for a week before writing this review.  The ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  Not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the Home Key and the trim at the top.  They aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so I don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  I'm also a little concerned that the USB port is worn.  It doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  So far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  Switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  I'm with AT&T, moving up from an S5.  I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, was indeed unlocked. I use it with my Ultra sim card with no issues. It came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which I didn't read of course:). The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. Fast delivery. P.S. I bought from store BuySpry.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My real rating would be about 3.75 stars if I could give that.  I used the phone for a week before writing this review.  The ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  Not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the Home Key and the trim at the top.  They aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so I don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  I'm also a little concerned that the USB port is worn.  It doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  So far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  Switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  I'm with AT&T, moving up from an S5.  I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"SO! After NOT getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my PLAIN cardboard box this phone came in, I took it back to Jamaica where my ""GSM Unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (Meaning it is not unlocked). I have bought GSM unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in Jamaica, but not this one. After requesting an unlock code from AT&T, only to be told that ""This device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".I want all of my money back, and I deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my wife's Galaxy S7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  Our carrier required an unlocked GSM phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""Verizon"" on the back).  The phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later I got the SIM card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""Processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).After about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * THAT WAS THE PROBLEM! *  Once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.

The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. Fast delivery. P.S. I bought from store BuySpry.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My real rating would be about 3.75 stars if I could give that.  I used the phone for a week before writing this review.  The ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  Not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the Home Key and the trim at the top.  They aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so I don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  I'm also a little concerned that the USB port is worn.  It doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  So far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  Switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  I'm with AT&T, moving up from an S5.  I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"SO! After NOT getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my PLAIN cardboard box this phone came in, I took it back to Jamaica where my ""GSM Unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (Meaning it is not unlocked). I have bought GSM unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in Jamaica, but not this one. After requesting an unlock code from AT&T, only to be told that ""This device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".I want all of my money back, and I deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my wife's Galaxy S7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  Our carrier required an unlocked GSM phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""Verizon"" on the back).  The phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later I got the SIM card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""Processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).After about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * THAT WAS THE PROBLEM! *  Once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"SO! After NOT getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my PLAIN cardboard box this phone came in, I took it back to Jamaica where my ""GSM Unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (Meaning it is not unlocked). I have bought GSM unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in Jamaica, but not this one. After requesting an unlock code from AT&T, only to be told that ""This device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".I want all of my money back, and I deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my wife's Galaxy S7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  Our carrier required an unlocked GSM phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""Verizon"" on the back).  The phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later I got the SIM card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""Processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).After about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * THAT WAS THE PROBLEM! *  Once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, was indeed unlocked. I use it with my Ultra sim card with no issues. It came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which I didn't read of course:). The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. Fast delivery. P.S. I bought from store BuySpry.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My real rating would be about 3.75 stars if I could give that.  I used the phone for a week before writing this review.  The ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  Not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the Home Key and the trim at the top.  They aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so I don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  I'm also a little concerned that the USB port is worn.  It doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  So far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  Switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  I'm with AT&T, moving up from an S5.  I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).

I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, was indeed unlocked. I use it with my Ultra sim card with no issues. It came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which I didn't read of course:). The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. Fast delivery. P.S. I bought from store BuySpry.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My real rating would be about 3.75 stars if I could give that.  I used the phone for a week before writing this review.  The ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  Not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the Home Key and the trim at the top.  They aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so I don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  I'm also a little concerned that the USB port is worn.  It doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  So far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  Switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  I'm with AT&T, moving up from an S5.  I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"SO! After NOT getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my PLAIN cardboard box this phone came in, I took it back to Jamaica where my ""GSM Unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (Meaning it is not unlocked). I have bought GSM unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in Jamaica, but not this one. After requesting an unlock code from AT&T, only to be told that ""This device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".I want all of my money back, and I deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my wife's Galaxy S7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  Our carrier required an unlocked GSM phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""Verizon"" on the back).  The phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later I got the SIM card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""Processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).After about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * THAT WAS THE PROBLEM! *  Once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, was indeed unlocked. I use it with my Ultra sim card with no issues. It came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which I didn't read of course:). The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. Fast delivery. P.S. I bought from store BuySpry.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My real rating would be about 3.75 stars if I could give that.  I used the phone for a week before writing this review.  The ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  Not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the Home Key and the trim at the top.  They aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so I don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  I'm also a little concerned that the USB port is worn.  It doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  So far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  Switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  I'm with AT&T, moving up from an S5.  I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"SO! After NOT getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my PLAIN cardboard box this phone came in, I took it back to Jamaica where my ""GSM Unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (Meaning it is not unlocked). I have bought GSM unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in Jamaica, but not this one. After requesting an unlock code from AT&T, only to be told that ""This device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".I want all of my money back, and I deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my wife's Galaxy S7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  Our carrier required an unlocked GSM phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""Verizon"" on the back).  The phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later I got the SIM card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""Processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).After about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * THAT WAS THE PROBLEM! *  Once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

I had to get a new SIM card (different size) from AT&T, which the tech installed for free.  I asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a You Tube.  He stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which I believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  Problem was, this is an unlocked Verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (I'm assuming from Verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  I kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  I used Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  That worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with Samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  Battery life seems good.  I'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  Summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  It took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  A nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  I got 2.5 years out of my refurbished S5, which still works although is getting quirky.  If this one lasts as long I'll have no complaints.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"SO! After NOT getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my PLAIN cardboard box this phone came in, I took it back to Jamaica where my ""GSM Unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (Meaning it is not unlocked). I have bought GSM unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in Jamaica, but not this one. After requesting an unlock code from AT&T, only to be told that ""This device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".I want all of my money back, and I deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Failed in less than two months. Battery is losing charge fast. Screen started flickering and phone started automatically deleting data without user doing anything to cause it.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my wife's Galaxy S7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  Our carrier required an unlocked GSM phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""Verizon"" on the back).  The phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later I got the SIM card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""Processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).After about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * THAT WAS THE PROBLEM! *  Once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  So.....should this happen to your S7 from Kiss Electronics......When you buy one of these from Kiss Electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  I do not know if this was Kiss Electronic's fault or Samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been MASTER RESET.  Once you get the cell, before you do ANYTHING to it, I would suggest doing the MASTER RESET just to be sure/safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Samsung G7 from what was touted as ""Amazon's choice refurbisher"".  I thought I would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  The first problem I saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  The phone would take pictures, and I don't take lots of pictures, so I decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  I need a phone for my business, and I didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.The second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  Even in the first month of using the phone, I could seldom get through a day on a charge.  I am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  I just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  I read several articles, and I went in and removed and disabled every app that I could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  Even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  I got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  Again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.The final straw is that now, in September, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  I am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old Samsung G5 in order to get me by (I have to have a phone for my business), until I can order another phone.  Of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.The bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" Amazon phone.  Find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  These phones have been returned because of a problem, and Amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the refurbished Galaxy S7 for my son's 17th birthday.  It arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  However, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  Basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  Out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  Unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the Samsung phones after updating to Android 8 (Oreo).  We made sure the OS and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by Samsung to address this issue in the Samsung Community.  No joy! There are MANY posts there concerning this issue.  I hope Samsung finds a fix soon.  It is otherwise a great phone.Fortunately, the seller, BuySPRY, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  I do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"DO NOT BOTHER BUYING ONE OF THESE! THEY OBVIOUSLY DO NOT INSPECT THEM PROPERLY IF I WAS ABLE TO NOTICE A VERY OBVIOUS SCREEN DEFECT WITHING A FEW HOURS OF OWNING THE PHONE! THEY SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT THAT AND NEVER TRIED TO PASS THIS PHONE OFF ON ANYONE!  The first day I got the phone I noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. I did not notice this until I already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so I figured I would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. It proved to be extremely annoying. After a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. It is infuriating because now I won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. This whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and I greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, was indeed unlocked. I use it with my Ultra sim card with no issues. It came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which I didn't read of course:). The phone was in initial setup mode. Tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. My phone hanged when I put in sim and chip. But when I removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. After that I could insert memory card and it was reading it. Tip 2: this phone (Galaxy S7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. I don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but I asked one at an Ultra shop. My phone was marked as Verizon, which I know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. Fast delivery. P.S. I bought from store BuySpry.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My real rating would be about 3.75 stars if I could give that.  I used the phone for a week before writing this review.  The ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  Not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the Home Key and the trim at the top.  They aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so I don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  I'm also a little concerned that the USB port is worn.  It doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.
