i'm going start review stating basically hated galaxy phones since they've come out loved old samsung flip phone made move android couldn't get them read amazing super amoled screen was thought garbage grainy colors much garish off ui cartoony weird colors years though samsung slowly stripped away bloat refined screens cleaned android skin time finally say they've sold methe feelthe first thing noticed amazing feels crazy thin encased cool smooth curved glass right amount heft make feel premium feels like smooth elegant flat pebble infinity screen and brothers note easily attractive i've ever seen departure older galaxy phones never struck aesthetic note mewhile elongated shape seems odd first actually makes screen narrow flagships works well accessing entire screen one hand still stretch managable way makes new onscreen navigation keys less obtrusive speaking onscreen keys i've never fan now work well home button even vibrating click press in like turning screen unlocking one shotthe physical buttons bit easy accidentally press don't like bixby button which i'll get later unnecessary makes volume keys harder findas much like design needs case don't mean bad thing although people i'm sure be delicate allglass design makes highly vulnerable breaking find reading reviews watching drop tests edge display detects accidental touches occasion volume keys clicky thin smooth makes easy drop case solves problems even didn't work construction which do would put case phone personally went spigen rugged armor samsung galaxy case spigen® rugged armor galaxy case
