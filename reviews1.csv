Was sent to ""Youbrakeifi ""  by Samsung  tech support. Diagnostic showed a flawed motherboard. I am leaving for overseas  next week. Amazon  declined  refund,so I have no phone. This the only way I can communicate,  no other phone in house. I have to spend an other$700 today to buy a phone. Will never ever purchase a phone from Amazon. No support.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a die hard Apple person. All my desktop computers at home are Apple, my other 4 family members all have iPhones and we have laptops that are all Apple. Not really sure why I decided to try out the Samsung Galaxy S9+ but happy that I did so far. I was using a 4 1/2 year old iPhone 5s so I figured any phone would be a huge upgrade to the modern world. It still takes a little getting used to coming from the IOS system's way of doing things. I do lose the capability of iMessage and FaceTime. Not a huge deal and I can use the DUO app from Google which is the same as FaceTime. The key points with this phone are that the large and beautiful screen looks great. I like the haptic feel of the keys when texting how you feel the keys being pressed (a little buzz/vibration). I think the new iPhone X does this too but again, I'm coming from a 5s. My only two choices for a new phone were this S9+ or keep on with Apple and get an iPhone X. The X would have cost me $1150 plus an AppleCare warranty for $200. I got this Samsung (and got the Ultimate Play Bundle) for $840 plus $100 for the bundle. Took out a Square Trade 2 year warranty for $108 with only a $99 deductible should I need to use it. I have used Square Trade warranties in the past for other products and they have always replaced and stood by their guarantee. Square Trade is owned by Allstate so I have confidence in them. Getting back to the phone, the S9+ seems to work VERY fast when loading apps and pages. I use it for a lot of my wireless products at home (Nest thermostat, wireless cameras, LIFX lights, Liftmaster garage door opener) and all work fast and flawlessly. The audio when playing music sounds great. Plays very loud and clear for a phone. I like the fact that it does still have an earphone jack. I like the Android system as it comes with Google Assistant voice command. Most people hate the Bixby feature on this phone. My only real gripe with it is the large button on the left side of the phone and that when trying to adjust the phone volume I accidentally hit Bixby sometimes. I do like though that i's voice activated. I get in my car in the morning, speak to wake up Bixby and command it to open up whatever app I need (usually Waze). Once open, I speak to Waze to take me to work. All of this without having to look at my phones screen or take my eyes off the road. Also, the Bixby AI camera function is very cool too. There are about 8 or 9 different things it can do with the camera. Like, point the camera lens at a sign in a foreign language and have it live translate the sign to English or any other language on the phone (and there are plenty of them on this phone). Point it at food and it will tell you what it is and average calorie count. Point it at a wine bottle label and it will give you the information on the wine (type, year, etc...). The ONLY thing I think I will never use again and of course I tried it out is the Animoji of myself or any of my friends. It's scary weird. Everyone looks the same on this. I would personally like to see an update to the phone where they fix this to be more of a 3D type and look more realistic. I have been looking online for days at comparisons of the pictures taken on this phone compared to others. Mot notably the iPhone X. In my opinion, the X does do a lot of pix better. The contrast is usually better. The real advantage to this phone is it tends to overexpose a bit. So, dark scenes will look a bit brighter than on the iPhone X. The only thing I had to get used to is the colors on a Samsung phone are very oversaturated. Colors are very bright. There is a setting in display function that gives you 4 options of view. I turned it down to one of them and it now looks a LOT more realistic. I like the fact that this phone, as well as the iPhone X, features ability to record video at 4K 60fps. Looks great. On the Samsung though the optical stabilization doesn't work when shooting 4K 60fps. Keep a steady hand and this isn't an issue. For all other video formats, the stabilization on the Samsung works better than the X. All in all, I am happy I went with the Samsung. In a few months if I regret it, I can always keep it for a few months and sell it to get the new larger iPhone X Plus.UPDATE: 4/7/2018.  The voice unlock code is terrible. And, after searching through the options on the phone I came to the conclusion I don't need it. I have the face unlock or the fingerprint reader on the back. I actually go to the back fingerprint scan to unlock more than the other methods as it's just quick and easy to use. Battery life has been good so far after using this phone for 3 weeks now. One thing I find annoying that I didn't know would be a problem is the video and picture quality when someone sends me a large video via texting. Whether I send them a video or they send me one, it becomes such low quality that it's almost hard to see it at all. This is because of the compression the carriers use to send these video's or large picture files so it doesn't take up much space. I was used to having an iPhone and using iMessage. Send any size video to someone else with an iPhone and it was in great quality on both sides of the text. Not so with Android. Now this is not just Samsung but all Android phones. So, for now, I have to send videos via WhatsApp or Viber (or a number of other text apps). They do compress but not horribly. Oh, and one more note. I hope Samsung corp is reading this review. The Samsung customer service reps have to be the stupidest people I have ever dealt with for a tech company. I used to think Comcast was bad until I called a couple of times and had to speak with someone at Samsung. They just repeat my question and tell me they understand how I feel offering absolutely no answers. They put you on hold to find out but come back with no resolve. Just terrible customer service. 180 degrees from dealing with someone at AppleCare when I had a question about my iPhone or iMac computer.2nd UPDATE: I didn't  realize this and this is VERY important to know before purchasing. In fact, I'm on the AT&T network with my phone and the people in the factory store didn't know this. The sales people in Best Buy in the phone department did not know this either. When you buy an unlocked Galaxy S9 or S9+, your phone is $840. If however you want to buy it thru AT&T for their network and not a factory unlocked phone, it has different options on it. Meaning, the unlocked phone WILL NOT have: WIFI calling option, HD Audio option, VVM (video voice messaging) and you will not get video voice calling. The option for these features is not even on my phone. Now, you CAN buy the AT&T phone and pay $915 up front or on a plan (either way it's $75 more than the factory unlocked phone). After you pay $75 ,more and if you are paying the full price up front, you can get the AT&T phone unlocked and then you will have these features. Nowhere at Best Buy or any AT&T store do they tell you this. In my mind, it's a great misrepresentation that is omitted when purchasing. I picked up the bundle package here on Amazon for $100 more and got a lot of cool gadgets so I'm keeping my setup. I just want others to know there is a difference when buying the unlocked version both in price and the feature set you get. I figured the AT&T version just had a bunch of their proprietary apps pre-installed. Hope this helps out someone beforehand that really wants those features. And, I went to the AT&T store figuring there was a way they could flash the options to my phone. There isn't. They cannot update your phone to get these options.3rd UPDATE: April 15th, 2018I discovered a great feature today. I wish these Galaxy 9 phones had the rise to wake feature which is what the iPhone X has. You pick up the phone and just look at it to unlock via your face and it's good to go. What I discovered is setting the Google Assistant to open the Galaxy EVEN FROM the locked screen via my voice and the phone unlocks and does what you ask the Google Assistant to do. Love this feature immensely.4th UPDATE April 23, 2018As I play around more with this phone, I am learning some cool things it can do. For instance, from the factory it come pre-set so that whether you swipe up or down the phone will go to your app tray. No need for repetition with swiping either up or down. There is a setting so that when you swipe up it opens the app tray (as it come from Samsung pre-set) but change the setting and when you swipe down from any place on the phone and you've got your phones popular settings in front of you. Even better, if you swipe down using two fingers from the top of the screen, it opens the second part of the settings which control other functions (usually this is a two part deal so this makes it one step easier). Also, one thing Samsung addressed with the 9 and 9+ (using the Oreo software) is a problem people using these phones prior used to hate. Now, you can set the up/down volume buttons to control MEDIA volume no matter what you are viewing. And, if you want to control the ringtone or another type of volume, when you push up or down on the volume and the MEDIA volume shows just tap on the down arrow on the top left of the screen and you have all the others ready to adjust exactly as you like them. Apparently from reading online this has been an annoyance of a problem for a long time with the Galaxy phones that is now solved.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"The box I received didn't have a phone in it!!! instead, it had a cheap plastic phone case. Also, the box had no seal on it so it could have been tampered with at any point. I watched ""unboxing"" videos for this phone, and there's supposed to be a sticker seal you have to break to open the box. From other reviews, it sounds like other customers have received empty boxes or dummy phones.Customer service is processing a replacement. Hopefully that goes alright.

There is a way to go around that issue, and you do not get the message anymore as long as the phone stays ON all the time, it is not a big deal.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was nervous about purchasing an unlocked phone from Amazon, not knowing what I'd get. But I purchased this, sold and fulfilled by Amazon, and have been very pleased with my S9.  I had to purchase a separate SIM card from my carrier, T-Mobile,  but that is true with any unlocked phone you buy.  This doesn't come with a wall or car charger but that is true for all S9's so you have to purchase these separately.  I've had earlier versions of Samsung phones and this is the best phone I've had in terms of screen clarity, memory speed, photo quality, audio and much more.  If you are considering buying this phone, your best best is to buy directly from Amazon as a seller, not a third party seller.  Otherwise, be sure to read the third party's terms carefully and be aware buying from a third party seller comes with risks.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This phone is absolutely fabulous!!  I switched from a Moto X Pure~ which I loved ~ so this is a huge upgrade.  It was so so easy to set up ~ there is an adapter included that you attach to your old phone and use an app to copy all of your files.  Awesome.  It is super fast and I love how customizable it is,  from themes to icons to fonts.  I haven't had any issues with Bixby.  Sound is awesome  and sound is a very important aspect to me.  The display is beautiful and camera is fabulous.  I am so concerned about breakage ~ I have MS and tend to twitch a lot and I drop things.  So I researched forever for a protective but pretty case and I hope I found it.  I also have a screen protector and a pop socket.  And I love the whole set up.  It now feels really secure in my hand.  The case did add a bit of weight but I don't mind.  I also worried about getting a fake phone or an empty box~ I purchased an unlocked phone and worried about that l.  Research your seller ~ I even emailed them and told them my concerns before I purchased mine.  I ended up getting mine from Endlessitems17 and highly recommend them.  Amazon didn't update the seller's stock before I already bought it.  They contacted me the same day,  offered me a black one, or a refund, or wait till they got one in.  I chose to wait rather than a refund cuz who knows how long that would take!  They weren't supposed to get any in for three days and that was Monday.  Customer service was awesome ~ said that they would try to find one quicker~ and I recieved my phone yesterday ~ Wednesday!  It came in perfect condition,  and was a breeze for Metro to get it up and running.  I am totally happy with this phone and recommend buying it!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This phone is leagues better than my S6 was, mostly due to refinement of the phone rather than innovation. It does everything you want it to, has a great camera, beautiful screen, and everything you've come to expect from a Samsung flagship.That said, it's not a massive improvement from the S8. It's more polished, but it is essentially the same phone.If your got a need to upgrade to a new device from a 3+ year old device, absolutely worth the investment. From a more modern phone, not so much.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was concerned about ordering the unlocked s9 after reading several mixed reviews on whether or not this was compatible with Verizon and some people saying they recieved refurbished or defective phones.  After more research and a nice sale price I took a bit of a chance and pulled the trigger.  Glad I did.  Received the phone in perfectly new condition and no issues on Verizon network at all.  I just popped in my sim and it's worked perfectly since.  Coming from an S8, the S9 is almost identical....with some notable improvements.  But I'm not going to turn this into an S9 product review.  If you're looking here for an unlocked phone to purchase, you already know if you like the S9 or not.  Anyway, I got a good quality, new phone at a much better price than I could have got direct from V, BB, or most other stores (unless you want to lock yourself in with a carrier for two years).

5.0 out of 5 stars," After doing about a month of research for what I want a phone to do and how much battery life and other features inside a phone it beats all the other phones I've had out of the water.  Granted I've only have phones 2013 or older this is like a night and day difference for my experience with phones.Pros - Sound quality out of the speakers is phenomal with highs not being too tiny and the bass not being too overbearing. - Picture quality set to the max QWHD+ is a glorious thing - Camera us stronger than a Canon G7X that i recently purchased only downside being the zoom function makes it rather quick to get blurry.  - Beautiful slo-mo option for video capture  - Selfie camera is amazing as well with the filter options to clear up a face and also has a wide selfie option for large groups of people  - Video recording is phenomenal with tracking and motion capturing - Lightning fast loads on apps and web pages when my connection is strong. - Fingerprint open on the back of phone conveniently placed - Iris Scanning - Plenty of battery life for a full days use of gps tracking and music playing - Samsung Pay option for paying for items without needing to pull out a cardCons - Camera zoom function isn't doing much good for picture quality but I understand it is in a small handheld device - Price tag as always with flagship phones are rather high but paying it out right for me and flipping the phone for newer flag ships in the future doesn't make it all that expensive of a purchase when I go with a resale value in a couple years.All in all I do enjoy this phone and for me I found it this phone to be completely worth it as just through the experience I've had with the pictures and battery life alone.  It has yet to have any hiccups while using the phone and always does what I need it to do.Only con that I have against it would be the price otherwise the phone is a complete stellar buy.

Ive been spoiled by having a phone that flawlessly synced with my Mac.  However I'm digging the extended battery life, the camera clarity, the screens resolution adjustability, the expandable memory  and things like that which have made the switch pleasant.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is the price and the lack of USB audio play through car audio systems.  Even with Black Friday pricing the S9 isn't really competitive in the price department.  For unknown reasons Samsung did away with the simple plug and play USB audio.  There is a Mirror Link app on the phone for using USB audio only a few cars have that capability.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"After 3 months with this phone, I can conclude that this is a very solid Android phone. Jam-packed with features like stereo speakers, LED indicator, wireless charging, Face Unlock/Iris Scanner, fast fingerprint sensor with gesture controls, headphone jack (obviously), 1440p Super OLED display and plenty of others features. The cameras, while nowhere near the level of the Google Pixel 3, are still very strong on their own, producing quality photos, steady video, and surprisingly good portrait mode. Only downsides are that the battery drains a little faster expected, a dedicated Bixby button which can be really annoying if you press on accident, Samsung bloatware, and a very tacky AR Emoji. Coming from an lifelong IPhone user, I can confidently say that anyone who isn’t too attached to the Apple Ecosystem will have an amazing experience. This is my first Android phone, and can say with confidence that Samsung successfully made me satisfied with my purchase.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"this is the best (and most beautiful) phone of 2018, hands down.Pixel 3 xl has a worse processor, less RAM, worse battery, no equalizer, no DeX, no hdmi output, no SD slot, the stupid notch, and is $200 more expensive.iPhone Xs Max has similar performance, no fingerprint sensor, worse battery life, no SD slot, the stupid notch, no DeX, and is $400-600 more expensive.Note 9 is too big for one-handed use, too big for most pockets, has the same processor as this phone, but is $300 more expensive (tho if u use the sPen, that's the best phone for u).seriously, i waited for all the flagship announcements, only to find out that the s9+, announced 6 months ago, is still the best phone of the year, and it's not even close.completely customizable, and just a pleasure to use. the new Samsung software is much better than the old bulk in the days of S3 or even Note3. I'm coming from Pixel XL, and i can vouch for this sw being very lightweight, useful, and snappy.also, the always-on-display is just a pleasure. i don't think I'll want to go back to not having this option. battery life is amazing. I'm very happy with this phone

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Note, when you purchase this product the name beneath the title of the product is the manufacturer name NOT the vendor! Not only was the phone I received different than the one I ordered but they also did not include a charging cable with the product. Don't let them fool you, these phones are NOT new, and they are NOT being sold by Samsung. Do yourself a favor and just go to Best Buy instead.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"My S7 Edge LCD screen just died last month so I needed a phone right away. I am currently with Verizon, so it sort of limits my phone choices. This phone works with Verizon, it was cheaper than buying it directly from Verizon, and I didn't have to pay an activation fee since I used my old sim card.In all honesty, I like the looks of the S7 Edge better than this S9. I also miss having a physical button at the bottom of the phone.Passive battery life on the S9 has been amazing so far. My old phone would be almost completely drained by the end of the day if I just checked it every once in a while. With the S9, I was periodically checking my phone once in a while, sending texts, etc., and I still had over 50% by midnight. Some apps do kill the battery life pretty quickly, but the phone will notify you every once in a while when it notices you have apps running in the background.Have not had time to play around with Bixby yet.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"My three stars has more to do with Amazon's screw up than the phone itself.WHEN YOU GET YOUR PHONE, CHECK THE MODEL NUMBER !!!SHOULD BE SM-G960U1.I ordered the US unlocked Galaxy S9 (model number SM-G960U1), BUT Amazon sent me a Chinese unlocked phone (model number SM-G9600). Although they look the same, the Chinese phone only sort of works (dropped calls, poor sound quality, incoming calls go straight to voice mail), does NOT have a US warranty (all support comes out of China), and critical features your carrier offers will be disabled (such as T-Mobile's Wifi Calling).It took me over a month to figure out why my wonderful Galaxy S9 was a piece of crap. And neither Amazon nor Samsung were of much help in discovering the source of my problem. It wasn't until I tried to register my phone with Samsung's U.S. website and failed that I got a clue.After much to do, Amazon replaced my Chinese phone with the correct one. Like magic everything appears to be working fine including Wifi Calling.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I Upgraded to the Galaxy S9 from the Galaxy S3. There are many improvements, however a lot was familiar. Used it on the AT&T network. It was easy getting a SIM from them and replacing the S3 on my account.  One note:  AT&T does not call the Galaxy S9 by name on your account device page because you did not buy it from them.  They simply call it a ""device"".  This designation does not cause any issues with billing or anything else on your account. I asked support to change ""device"" to Galaxy S9, but it never went through.  The camera itself has beautiful playback of all forms of media and has a great battery life. I'm not wild about the sidebar tabs to stow all your contacts and apps, I think they get in the way of other things you are doing.  Summary: great phone.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome phone and love the fact that it's unlocked so no additional junk from your carrier if you would purchased it thru a carrier. I did have an issue about warranty but from the Samsung care + side but was not disclosd when purchasing this phone. All in all Amazon was willing to resolve the matter and gave me other options to purchase warranty. So overall love the phone and Amazon customer service is top notch!!!!!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Due to all the negative comments that previous people wrote regarding receiving boxes with no phones, or phones with scratches or previously used phones I was hesitant to make this purchase but happy to report the following:The Samsung Galaxy S9 unlocked (US Version) 256GB Coral Blue phone arrived in Brand new condition.  Packaging was brand new with seals on packaging and phone also had factory protective clear films front and back.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Has the typical OEM bloatware as well as some Google and third-party software that can't be removed. The hardware Bixby button is an obvious attempt at overriding Google assistant.  It's very easy to activate unintentionally.A Samsung account is necessary to use their competing features; even some that don't make sense to need an account.The screen is brilliant and beautiful. The curved edges give it an attractive illusion of depth. Battery life is very good and recharge is very fast.  Samsung has the best swipe and predictive qwerty of all brands I've owned.I'm very happy with my purchase.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this Amazon warehouse purchase because I could not bring myself to pay full price for todays high end smartphones.  After looking at the product I received it looks and functions as new.  I am deducting two stars because I tried to register the phone for warranty service to find that it couldn't be registered.  So I'm pulling one star for amazon listing it as having a US warranty, and one star from Samsung for not being able to register the product.  I will continue to test the functionality of this phone in the coming week.  Great value for the money if Samsung supports the product as advertised.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a die hard Apple person. All my desktop computers at home are Apple, my other 4 family members all have iPhones and we have laptops that are all Apple. Not really sure why I decided to try out the Samsung Galaxy S9+ but happy that I did so far. I was using a 4 1/2 year old iPhone 5s so I figured any phone would be a huge upgrade to the modern world. It still takes a little getting used to coming from the IOS system's way of doing things. I do lose the capability of iMessage and FaceTime. Not a huge deal and I can use the DUO app from Google which is the same as FaceTime. The key points with this phone are that the large and beautiful screen looks great. I like the haptic feel of the keys when texting how you feel the keys being pressed (a little buzz/vibration). I think the new iPhone X does this too but again, I'm coming from a 5s. My only two choices for a new phone were this S9+ or keep on with Apple and get an iPhone X. The X would have cost me $1150 plus an AppleCare warranty for $200. I got this Samsung (and got the Ultimate Play Bundle) for $840 plus $100 for the bundle. Took out a Square Trade 2 year warranty for $108 with only a $99 deductible should I need to use it. I have used Square Trade warranties in the past for other products and they have always replaced and stood by their guarantee. Square Trade is owned by Allstate so I have confidence in them. Getting back to the phone, the S9+ seems to work VERY fast when loading apps and pages. I use it for a lot of my wireless products at home (Nest thermostat, wireless cameras, LIFX lights, Liftmaster garage door opener) and all work fast and flawlessly. The audio when playing music sounds great. Plays very loud and clear for a phone. I like the fact that it does still have an earphone jack. I like the Android system as it comes with Google Assistant voice command. Most people hate the Bixby feature on this phone. My only real gripe with it is the large button on the left side of the phone and that when trying to adjust the phone volume I accidentally hit Bixby sometimes. I do like though that i's voice activated. I get in my car in the morning, speak to wake up Bixby and command it to open up whatever app I need (usually Waze). Once open, I speak to Waze to take me to work. All of this without having to look at my phones screen or take my eyes off the road. Also, the Bixby AI camera function is very cool too. There are about 8 or 9 different things it can do with the camera. Like, point the camera lens at a sign in a foreign language and have it live translate the sign to English or any other language on the phone (and there are plenty of them on this phone). Point it at food and it will tell you what it is and average calorie count. Point it at a wine bottle label and it will give you the information on the wine (type, year, etc...). The ONLY thing I think I will never use again and of course I tried it out is the Animoji of myself or any of my friends. It's scary weird. Everyone looks the same on this. I would personally like to see an update to the phone where they fix this to be more of a 3D type and look more realistic. I have been looking online for days at comparisons of the pictures taken on this phone compared to others. Mot notably the iPhone X. In my opinion, the X does do a lot of pix better. The contrast is usually better. The real advantage to this phone is it tends to overexpose a bit. So, dark scenes will look a bit brighter than on the iPhone X. The only thing I had to get used to is the colors on a Samsung phone are very oversaturated. Colors are very bright. There is a setting in display function that gives you 4 options of view. I turned it down to one of them and it now looks a LOT more realistic. I like the fact that this phone, as well as the iPhone X, features ability to record video at 4K 60fps. Looks great. On the Samsung though the optical stabilization doesn't work when shooting 4K 60fps. Keep a steady hand and this isn't an issue. For all other video formats, the stabilization on the Samsung works better than the X. All in all, I am happy I went with the Samsung. In a few months if I regret it, I can always keep it for a few months and sell it to get the new larger iPhone X Plus.UPDATE: 4/7/2018.  The voice unlock code is terrible. And, after searching through the options on the phone I came to the conclusion I don't need it. I have the face unlock or the fingerprint reader on the back. I actually go to the back fingerprint scan to unlock more than the other methods as it's just quick and easy to use. Battery life has been good so far after using this phone for 3 weeks now. One thing I find annoying that I didn't know would be a problem is the video and picture quality when someone sends me a large video via texting. Whether I send them a video or they send me one, it becomes such low quality that it's almost hard to see it at all. This is because of the compression the carriers use to send these video's or large picture files so it doesn't take up much space. I was used to having an iPhone and using iMessage. Send any size video to someone else with an iPhone and it was in great quality on both sides of the text. Not so with Android. Now this is not just Samsung but all Android phones. So, for now, I have to send videos via WhatsApp or Viber (or a number of other text apps). They do compress but not horribly. Oh, and one more note. I hope Samsung corp is reading this review. The Samsung customer service reps have to be the stupidest people I have ever dealt with for a tech company. I used to think Comcast was bad until I called a couple of times and had to speak with someone at Samsung. They just repeat my question and tell me they understand how I feel offering absolutely no answers. They put you on hold to find out but come back with no resolve. Just terrible customer service. 180 degrees from dealing with someone at AppleCare when I had a question about my iPhone or iMac computer.2nd UPDATE: I didn't  realize this and this is VERY important to know before purchasing. In fact, I'm on the AT&T network with my phone and the people in the factory store didn't know this. The sales people in Best Buy in the phone department did not know this either. When you buy an unlocked Galaxy S9 or S9+, your phone is $840. If however you want to buy it thru AT&T for their network and not a factory unlocked phone, it has different options on it. Meaning, the unlocked phone WILL NOT have: WIFI calling option, HD Audio option, VVM (video voice messaging) and you will not get video voice calling. The option for these features is not even on my phone. Now, you CAN buy the AT&T phone and pay $915 up front or on a plan (either way it's $75 more than the factory unlocked phone). After you pay $75 ,more and if you are paying the full price up front, you can get the AT&T phone unlocked and then you will have these features. Nowhere at Best Buy or any AT&T store do they tell you this. In my mind, it's a great misrepresentation that is omitted when purchasing. I picked up the bundle package here on Amazon for $100 more and got a lot of cool gadgets so I'm keeping my setup. I just want others to know there is a difference when buying the unlocked version both in price and the feature set you get. I figured the AT&T version just had a bunch of their proprietary apps pre-installed. Hope this helps out someone beforehand that really wants those features. And, I went to the AT&T store figuring there was a way they could flash the options to my phone. There isn't. They cannot update your phone to get these options.3rd UPDATE: April 15th, 2018I discovered a great feature today. I wish these Galaxy 9 phones had the rise to wake feature which is what the iPhone X has. You pick up the phone and just look at it to unlock via your face and it's good to go. What I discovered is setting the Google Assistant to open the Galaxy EVEN FROM the locked screen via my voice and the phone unlocks and does what you ask the Google Assistant to do. Love this feature immensely.4th UPDATE April 23, 2018As I play around more with this phone, I am learning some cool things it can do. For instance, from the factory it come pre-set so that whether you swipe up or down the phone will go to your app tray. No need for repetition with swiping either up or down. There is a setting so that when you swipe up it opens the app tray (as it come from Samsung pre-set) but change the setting and when you swipe down from any place on the phone and you've got your phones popular settings in front of you. Even better, if you swipe down using two fingers from the top of the screen, it opens the second part of the settings which control other functions (usually this is a two part deal so this makes it one step easier). Also, one thing Samsung addressed with the 9 and 9+ (using the Oreo software) is a problem people using these phones prior used to hate. Now, you can set the up/down volume buttons to control MEDIA volume no matter what you are viewing. And, if you want to control the ringtone or another type of volume, when you push up or down on the volume and the MEDIA volume shows just tap on the down arrow on the top left of the screen and you have all the others ready to adjust exactly as you like them. Apparently from reading online this has been an annoyance of a problem for a long time with the Galaxy phones that is now solved.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"The box I received didn't have a phone in it!!! instead, it had a cheap plastic phone case. Also, the box had no seal on it so it could have been tampered with at any point. I watched ""unboxing"" videos for this phone, and there's supposed to be a sticker seal you have to break to open the box. From other reviews, it sounds like other customers have received empty boxes or dummy phones.Customer service is processing a replacement. Hopefully that goes alright.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this phone some months ago and was extremely excited to try it out. It arrived perfectly with all the parts and pieces it was supposed to come with and for the first two months I was completely satisfied with my purchase. I'd also took measures and purchased a heavy duty phone case and a screen protector to make sure this puppy lasted me a while. However, two months in, my phone started unexpectedly freezing and the battery life was starting to decline rapidly. I had only used 18 of the 64 GB available but I took the time to clean out my storage and any unnecessary files anyways in hopes that the phone's behavior would improve. To my surprise, its performance was rapidly declining more and more by the days. Not long after it got to the point where my phone screen would randomly turn itself off and not turn back on. The phone would vibrate like it would when it was on when I'd press the home button but the screen would not light up. It would do this multiple times a day and I would have to manually soft reset it every single time. I reached out to Samsung support and was not able to receive any help or answers from them. By this point my 30-day warranty had already expired and Amazon would no longer be able to exchange the phone for me. I wish I had just spent a few dollars extra to make sure that I had received a reliable phone. Very unsatisfied

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Just ordered this device to replace an older S7 Edge whose battery expanded on me and took the back of the phone out with it as it expanded - that phone was only three years old but well beyond its warranty.I hope the battery on the S9 won't go the way the S7 did.Enabling the S9 on the Verizon network only involved swapping the SIM card between devices.  It confused me a bit because it was my understanding I would have to register the devices exchange on the Verizon website.  It happened automatically after installing the old SIM card in the new phone.The device came with Android Oreo from February 2018 installed - needed a couple of patch updates.  It also came charged 96%.The S9 has a smaller screen, it's a bit lighter and much more responsive  than the S7 Edge.  It could also be that it's new so Android isn't as bloated, although it has all my data and apps moved over.  Transferring data and settings was a snap - used the Samsung utility and USB cable adapter to do this.Good experience so far to get going, if something happens, I'll be back here to amend this review.  Excellent experience so far with both the phone and Amazon's handling of it.

I have wasted a week's time, tried a couple of different SIM cards from a couple of different carriers, purchased a new SIM card, and am just DONE with this.  Do not believe the Q&A section where it says the phone can be used with all 4 carriers.  It absolutely CANNOT.  I will be returning this.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"It's clear now that mine arrived defective. A problem started as intermittent and got worse: people couldn't hear me on speakerphone, and sometimes in handset mode too. I had a long call with tech support 3 months in, which ended in my hard-resetting the phone. The problem seemed to go away but didn't really. Then I dropped the phone getting a functional, and barely visible crack. I eventually confronted the problem again, calling tech support. I mentioned the crack and they said this would not impede repair under warranty. As instructed, I brought it to UfixIbreak, where I was told that a) the drop voided the warranty for all parts b) they would replace the broken part without also doing the screen even though I didn't need it done. So the cost for me was not zero but $340.When my Korean car gets rear-ended, does that automatically void all the warranty on all the engine parts?I am livid and definitely won't buy a Samsung again.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I read all the reviews and decided to go with the Amazon shipped version of this phone to have the Amazon guarantee.  A lot of reviews said this phone would not work on Verizon, and that voicemail and wireless calling was not going to work.  Well, all of these comments were obviously from people who didn't investigate it thoroughly.  My wireless calling works fine, my voicemail works fine and the phone works on Verizon.  Here is what I discovered that you will need to do if you purchase this phone if you putting it on Verizon.  Be sure to register an account with Samsung Galaxy store right on the phone and update all of your apps and when you do, it will give you Samsung Essentials and visual voicemail that is just like Verizon's only with a Blue Icon instead of Red.  Works the same.  If you go into the settings, and turn on wireless calling, it might take a couple of tries, but it does come on, and it does work as I live in a completely shielded home where Verizon's signal does not penetrate my walls or roof and my phone works perfectly over wireless.  As far as getting connected to Verizon goes, all you have to do is take your SIM card from your old phone and put it in the new phone.  If you have to get a new SIM card from Verizon because of size difference, have Verizon register a new SIM to your old phone, then you put it into the new phone.  These phones are approved on Verizon's list of phones, but their system does not recognize the IMEI number and says it is not compatible and won't let the stores customer service reps scan the phone into their system.  You have to put your old SIM into the new phone and then it works perfectly.  I called 611 while I was in the store and they told me how to get around their system not recognizing the IMEI numbers as valid.The unlocked S9+ is the best phone I have ever had..... totally happy with my purchase.

They look nice and the battery seems to last all day if fully charged.Buying them on Amazon means no re-upping my Sprint contract, which is good because I prefer to minimize my commitments to any contract.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first time buying an unlocked phone online and I feel like I got more than I bargained for. The Super AMOLED screen is hands down one of the best I have seen on a smartphone and I am enjoying it very much. Same goes for the speakers.In addition to that, I got to ""pixelize"" my phone, download tons of apps, files and I have to say I have not suffered from the infamous samsung lag, but if it does slow down at one point, samsung does have a function to test, diagnose and optimize your phone so I plan on taking advantage of that in the future.I'm also very satisfied with the battery. I'm a heavy user and so far it has been lasting me for a full day whereas my previous phone needed to be charged twice per day.As for the camera, I have yet to fully test what it's capable of, but I've taken a few low light pictures and have been quite impressed by how nice they looked.All in all this is a great phone and definitely a worthy purchase.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Several reviews said this unlocked phone would be fine with Boost Mobile.  Took it into a boost store and the lady behind the counter was really nice and she tried and tried and could not get it to work with Boost.  Even though Boost sells this exact same phone.... hmm...  Nice gimmick, boost.  She did say the phone was sprint compatible.  Boost is owned by Sprint and its phones will run on the Sprint network.  So, what gives Boost?

1.0 out of 5 stars,"everything is great on this phone, but one thing. The touch! Apparently, it is a known issue that the s9 and s9plus have horrible touch sensitivity issues. You can't type two words without wanting to throw the phone across the room. And it is in every app. Even the screen pattern to unlock makes me want throw it down and cry.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to buy cheaper moto g phones i'm glad I finally bought something decent. The display is impressive and the bar at the top it more appealing to the eye than the notch on the iphone Xr and XS or the pixel 3. Camera is really good to and takes some impressive shots. I get a full day out of the battery using a mix of maps, camera and streaming music (normally for most of the day). The inclusion of wired AKG head phones is nice and the headphone port means there is compatibility with a range or portable amplifiers. I don't get why this isn't on other phones as not having it really limits your choice in headphones or you have to have a DAC/amp comb. Sound quality is good I from the onboard DAC/amp but I don't know about driving and thing larger than in ears. Bixby is ok, I tend to use googles assistant if i need to. Having the sd card slot is nice and allows for easy upgrade of the storage and for me to easily pull images I want to work on using my mac from the phone with out having to mess around with bluetooth or file transfer.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great screen, fast processor, beautiful phone.  Camera is amazing.  Must say, after 10+ years of being an iPhone fan, this S9 kicks my old iPhone's rear.  Love the functionality, smart design, and flexibility.  And almost half the price of an iPhone. Took me about two weeks to get used to Android, but it is so much more useful than mono-button. over-controlling iOS.  Great phone and great operating system.  I am a convert!

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am having issues with my unlocked S9 model SM-g960u.  The hardware I received is perfectly fine and in fact the S9 is probably the most beautiful phone I've ever laid eyes on and its a damn shame that I am going to be returning this one.  I bought mine from JD Electronics at an amazing price of 563$. HOWEVER, I would gladly have paid more for a phone with no issues.  I've received numerous error messages and quirks that lead me to believe this phone has been region locked or has an incompatible firmware.Software update: One of the first things I tried to do with this phone was downloading updates for it.  When you navigate to Settings > Software Update > Download updates manually | The phone displays ""registering device"" and then ""processing failed.""Samsung Pay: When I try to open it says ""Access to Smasung Pay has been denied. Unauthorized modifications have been made to your device"" This means somehow the ""Knox Counter"" has been tripped on this device, which supposedly detects when someone roots it.  The next time I tried to open it says Samsung Pay is not supported on this device.  A SAMSUNG!Region: After experiencing these quirks I went to Settings > About Phone | where i discovered the region is set to United Arab Emirates.  Why would that be? The product even said United State Warranty in the description?Bixby:  When I swipe left to Bixby Home, scrolling down to the news cards ""Newsroom"" ""youtube"" ""Yahoo"" etc... all display headlines in Chinese and take me to chinese websites.  The language is set to english in phone and bixby settings.Samsung +: after experiencing much slower youtube speeds over mobile data than my previous S7 active, I downloaded Samsung+ to do a speed test.  When I navigate to Samsung+ > Diagnostic tools > Connection Speed Test > Mobile > Start speed test | it says ""connected to AT&T LTE Network, displays a ping reading for a few seconds, then says ""Test Cancelled"".Samsung Smart Switch: Samsung Smart switch will not recognize my device, saying it is incompatible.All of theses quirks lead me to beleive something is seriously defective or incompatible about my version of this phone.  I can't download software updates. I can't connect to Smart Switch on PC.  I am having serious anxiety over this purchase and warn anyone from buying such an expensive item from a third party seller.  I put a return/refund request to JD Electronics and have not heard back from them yet.  Will update this if they contact me.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purely impressed!  An amazing piece of hardware from Samsung which - to me - excels in all things hardware related, and this is no exception.  There is not a single element of the hardware (screen, battery, size, ports, camera, hardware specifications, resilience, and so forth) that isn't outstanding on paper or in action.  The added customization, openness,  and versatility of the Android OS is welcomed compared to Apple's iOS.The added versatility of the unlocked version is nice if a carrier switch or something of that sort is possible, but may inhibit certain carrier exclusive features depending on the carrier (like digital voicemail).My only minor complaint is of all the Samsung apps, software, and features (bloatware?) that is crammed into the phone and semi-forces its use.  A lot it seems like more of sales pitch rather than adding any value.  *Cough*  The ""Bixby Button""...  *Cough*  I feel this is Samsung's weak-point with its mobile offerings at the moment.As an aside, this is my first Android phone, after having all iPhones.  I decided to switch to the Galaxy S9 and Android OS after not liking the direction Apple was going with its flagship phones. Plus, the cutting edge features combined with sensible design choices, such as a headphone jack and touch recognition, compelled me to ""switch-sides"".  6+ months later, at the time of this review, I'm still completely satisfied with my Galaxy S9.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded from an S6 so I'm pretty familiar with the S9 Plus although there are changes. Loved my S6 and love the S9 Plus although I don't like the larger size.

Not a big deal since it'll be in a case but if you have your heart set on a particular color, make sure that's what they're sending you.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had the phone for about 2 weeks now. For the most part, I love it. Huge upgrade and so much faster than my previous S5. However, I'm not a big fan of the curved edges. I was a little hesitant to purchase this due to reviews saying the phone was missing from the box, but I am glad I did. This was the cheapest unlocked S9 that I found.  Nothing was missing. This phone included the fast charge cable with block, ear buds with 3 sets of different size tips, sim card removal key, and a female USB A to a male USB C adapter to transfer data from your old phone to the new one. I will update this after I have had the phone longer but as of right now I'm a happy customer.

I then proceeded to transfer everything on my old phone to new phone by USB. it came with an adapter. It was easy and took much less time than it had indicated. The camera is the bomb. A lot of options. Most are pretty intuitive. One has a slider that allows you to make the background blurrier or clearer. I plan to read the manual on the others. The only think I am having trouble with is the brightness switching from inside to outside lighting. I thought I set it to adjust automatically but I have had to change it manually everytime I go outside. Again hopefully the manual with have an adjustment that works. The phone is very attractive. I choose the blue one. It is not as light as it looks in the pictures but still very nice. So far the switch was easy and the pictures are great. The price was awesome. Very happy with my purchase.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Galaxy S9 was a replacement for an older generation Galaxy that could no longer hold all of the apps I use.  My smartphone use consists primarily of voice, text, search, and GPS guidance functions and an occasional photograph.  It also functions as an always available stand in for my Kindle. For me, the Galaxy S9 is the perfect combination of size, function, reliability and battery life.  I've wrapped it in an OtterBox Commuter case coupled with a MagGlass screen protector to help protect it against the inevitable drops and impacts it will experience over time.  It's menu system is simple and relatively intuitive although I'm sure I've missed some of its advanced functions since I haven't taken the time to download or read the full user manual. Overall, I couldn't be happier with the phone.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"So far so good, phone isn't a clone as far as I can tell, so that's good. Came in pretty good condition, however the sim tool was loose and there are a few scratches near the top of the phone. There is also some weird white stuff on the ear piece that doesn't seem to wanna come off so I question if it's really a BRAND NEW phone. My only other issue is that for a full price phone, you would think all the accessories would be real. The headphones that come with it are a cheap Vietnam knock off of the akg headphones and don't even have the akg logo on them, and they sound very muffled, and feel really cheap. The adapter for the phone charger is real, however the charging cable isn't the original Samsung charging cable at all, barely even fits into the adapter (sticks out a bit). And there is no Samsung seal of approval in the box, so I can only assume someone opened it, took out what they wanted and replaced it with cheap knock offs of what should be in there, and forgot to put the seal back. If I didn't need this phone so bad I would send it back and request an entirely brand new device that is completely sealed and never been opened. But my old phone is a vegetable so I can't go back to it. Lastly on the possibility of a clone, the pictures that it takes look very....odd, like the quality is very low rez, again making me question if this is a ""really good"" clone. I don't recommend going through this seller by any means. 👎👎

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this phone thinking that it would be better than my current S6 Edge - and just about in every way it is specially low light shots, but disappointed with the picture AI results in general.  I normally use my phone as a camera, less so as a computer or streaming device.Sure wide shots look indiscernible, but once you want to see some details the S9+ images become murky at 100% zoom as the Auto settings normally changes to F1.5 (no you cannot force it to use F2.4 in auto mode - which most users use)  Fonts looks blotchy upon closer inspection.  Yes I understand you can set it to Pro mode so you can do this, but most times I use my phone to take pictures within 3 secs, no time for fiddling with settings.The S6 has a 16M native resolution at 4x3, so setting it to 16x9 reduces resolution to 12M.The 9+ has a 12M native resolution at 4x3, so setting it to 16x9 reduces resolution to 9M.Quite possible this may be causing it, but I read the Pixel has the same resolution but takes better photos because of the AI implementation.I normally shoot at 16x9 size settings so it fills my monitor screen and FB uploads, and this is how I compared the shots.Aside from the uploaded picture, I have also compared outside scenes on both phones - and I do notice slightly murkier pictures with the S9+.In the DLSR world, sometimes you get bad lens so the logical thing is to replace the lens for a sharper one, but not everyone has this luxury with a phone specially if you are at a mobile carrier store with strict use limits.  I did a little research and found forums where people complain of the image quality as well, so I don't think I'm in the minority.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"First let me say that the Galaxy S9+ is a big beautiful phone. The screen is outstanding, the speed is fast and it has more features than I ever probably learn to use. Definitely a first-class phone from Samsung.What I really want to say is: I purchased this Galaxy S9+ from the Amazon Warehouse at great price with an additional 20% discount. I was concerned about purchasing a Used-Like New phone but my son, who had previously worked at Amazon, said those phones were in new condition and a great buy. He was right.The phone was without a scratch and had a clean esn. It came in the original box ( a little beat up) with all the original accessories still wrapped up. Activation was no problem and it is working great. And it was half the price of a new phone! Half price for a Galaxy S9+! I am so happy and will recommend to my friends who are shopping for new phones to check out the Amazon warehouse deals.UPDATE: I am taking off one star because I cannot get insurance on phone. Amazon will not provide nor even offer insurance on own product. There are two insurance providers on Amazon, SquareTrade and Asurion, but neither will cover used Amazon phone. Interestingly, the both cover used eB*y phones but Amazon can't or won't get them to cover their used products. Go figure???

Although this phone has a lot of bangs and whistles, I think she has gotten used to using it far faster than we thought she would.  She is taking and sending pictures a lot more than she ever has before, and has even figured out how to use some of the other basic functions that she would not have used before.  She is very happy with her purchase, and would recommend this product.  Samsung has done a wonderful job with developing their product.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Now this phone would be the ideal phone for a younger person or ppl with small fingers and can see will. Since I’m either the reason for the stars. I went from a iPhone 6 Plus to this and have wanted to busted it up every since. It’s not the phones fault. It’s mine because I can’t see it well and my fingers are to big to text correctly. I’m always hitting button I didn’t mean to and have to erase and retype most of my text. Maybe should have went with the plus size. The volume is a little low for my hearing and I didn’t think my hearing was bad. I find sometimes I have to hold it up to my ear to hear somethings. I don’t know if it me or the phone. The battery life I have to charge it every night. I am not a person to stay on my phone all day. Just general text,Facebook and maybe play a game for a bit. There maybe things I can turn off to extend the battery which I have turned to YouTube for some advise but I still didn’t find anything to help extend the battery. Overall, after being so excited with getting a chance to have one of these phones I am disappointed with it. I’m 41 years old so I’m not over the hill. I wish I could go back and buy the plus version. So on this one be your on judge.

All functions work well and are generally intuitive.Update: latest update allows you repurpose the bixby button, making it slightly less worthless. Downside is that it forces you to keep bixby enabled.  One press let's you open an app of your choice (such as the camera app), two presses opens Bixby.

I bought it when it was first released, and there was an issue either with the OS or Spotify that ate memory, causing me to have to reboot it every night. There has since been a software update which fixed the issue (issue was fixed after a Samsung update, not a Spotify update, so I think it was them), and now the phone is great.Amazing memory. No need to clear out old apps or photos or videos. Runs fast with no issues. And even if you did start to have a problem, there's a built in system optimizer so you don't have to download an app that's actually going to make it worse.The only issue I have is with the ""Edge"" feature. It does not integrate well with a lot of social media, so some pictures (ex Instagram stories) are cut off on the sides.

Then periodically the phone would stop charging, saying that there was water in the charging outlet when there wasn't.  After a while it just stopped charging entirely unless using a wireless charging port.  Mind you, we've had the phone for less than 2 months at this point.  Sent the phone into Samsung and they said the phone was out of warranty.  We specifically chose the phone option with a warranty, which cost more, for this reason.  Currently on the phone with Amazon and my partner's talking to Samsung to see what our options are, what a complete waste of time.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"The speaker distorts really bad when the music is at high volume. The reason i bought this was for the camera and the new speakers. The camera's front flash when on whatsapp conversations does not work. If you need to send someone a picture, you have to go the the camera itself, take the picture then go back into whatsapp to send it. I mean its not a huge deal but i'd like if the front flash worked in whatsapp. All in all, good phone but mehhh!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was so nervous about getting this phone after reading some of the reviews, but I'm happy to say I've had it almost a month so far and still no complaints. I use verizon towers through straight talk and had no issue setting it up myself. It is all glass so I recommend a nice case and screen protector. The camera is amazing and the set up is really nice. I also loved that it didn't come with all the random apps that I never used on my old phones.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"When I called Samasung tech support about the S9+ muffled quality of the phone's microphone (complaints from people I've called), I discovered, from Samsung, there was only 5-months of warranty remaining. The phone is supposed to have a 1-year warranty.Calling Amazon, they now tell me that the warranty began when they took possession of the phone, not when I take possession of the phone. Now, Samsung includes all the warranty information in the packaging, however Amazon doesn't deem it necessary to provide clear-and-full disclosure of this important bit of information. This lack of full disclosure could be extremely expensive. To be clear, you're getting a perfectly new phone from Amazon but...without the full warranty.I am, of course returning the phone. Sad, that I have been very pleased with Amazon for a long time only to discover this lack of clear disclosure in the packaging. I am well aware the phone has a 1-year warranty, but you must dig through the fine print to find this is not true if purchased through Amazon. If your new phone is sitting on a shelf in their warehouse, then your warranty is slowly expiring.After discovering this, I had no interest in trouble shooting a problem with the S9+ micorphone which turns out to NOT be compatible with the new, higher-quality, high-security standard of VoLTE phone calling. With the S9+, you're paying for this feature on this next generation phone -- though Samsungs product, here, is flawed. Samsung's work around is to deactivate your 4G VoLTE feature. This means audio and Video calls are reverted back to the fuzzy dark ages.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for my dad to activate as a Verizon phone.  It is NOT the same phone you'd get at Verizon. He spent so much time calling Samsung and they told him this-This phone will not have the identical capabilities as what you'd buy at Verizon. Specifically, the video call feature with another Android, and will not using WiFi for calls if you don't have cell service. These are TWO big things that doesn't make sense to go without when you pay this much for a phone.  SO upset.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"So if the phone worked I'd give it 4 or 5 stars but not being able to charge by wire is a very big bug apparently not too uncommon for this phone.  I can charge it wirelessly, I can connect the phone to my laptop and perform the Samsung Smart Switch backup process, but for some unknown reason it fails to charge through the USB port.  Service to Samsung has been above average but its outsourced overseas scripted help - this takes extra time spent try to explain the symptoms and get the desired support.  Naturally with a suspect hardware error I now have the undesirable task of shipping the phone to them, waiting for it to be repaired/replaced, and then waiting for the return,  From what I'm told that sounds like a two week turnaround.  This is a flagship phone.  Samsung is a big seller of these phones.  Support should be much stronger IMHO - such as accelerated return and repair for such a new phone.Battery life has been good, wifi and bluetooth have been solid and aren't draining my battery, screen look great, find the Bixby button to be in an annoying location often accidentally pressed and then more time wasted to cancel it.  Have had no system locks or unexpected reboots unlike my former platform.  Wish it did other things that the last phone did such as hands free txt while driving.  The email apps I've used thusfar leave desirable room for improvements such as the ability to place email folders at the home screen - less clicks to see stuff.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got my unlocked Samsung Galaxy S9, it works with cricket wireless! Just plugged in my sim card and it works perfectly. Very happy with my purchase.

So far I love the phone!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The true color of this device (Coral Blue) isn't well represented in cook position to real life. The phone is soooooo much richer in color. The device isn't too long and fits decently in my hand. Android got a real big overhaul from what I remember years ago since my S4 and S2. It doesn't seem to be a real sacrifice switching from an iPhone 6s. Bixby button down he do much for me so I disabled it within a week. Only things I would like like to see is a texture back bverson of these devices...yes there are skins to apply but having an alternative would be nice...

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This phone is great. Not cheap,but a bad pick for me. I did not need this much phone. All these features I probably never use. I also have a Samsung tv and I must say it was easy doing the screen mirroring thing. Netflix from my phone to tv. So the phones great and I give it five stars, but being new to smart phones I bought more phone than I need and would not buy it again.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this on sale for a good deal and I am impressed with the sound quality, the camera, pretty much everything. I was replacing an S5 so I was a bit behind on the phones. It was easy to set up, I just had to visit my Verizon store and buy a SIM card because the S5 wouldn't work. It was around $10 bucks. Comes with headphones and a handy device that lets you port all of your stuff from your old phone, into the new one. Overall, I am satisfied with this phone, hopefully it lasts me as long as the S5 did!

3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Galaxy S8 Plus battery was great, this feels like a major step backward, as I needed to charge the phone at least 3 times just to get through 8-5.There are also major software problems too: the VPN simply refused to function after switched from Wi-Fi to cellular, requiring manual disconnect and reconnect to the VPN. My office has several Wi-Fi dead spots, as you can see it can get frustrating very quickly. Samsung support is virtually useless, they kept on saying it is not a problem.Now the good: camera is phenomenal, the best out there; performance is light years ahead of the S8, I don't even see the stuttering in the Google Play Store, that's how smooth the phone is.Overall, solid phone hindered by poor battery life and my personal issue with VPN according to Samsung, so I decided to deal with it as a customer who has an issue with the product: returning it. Guess I would use the S8 one more year.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this Phone on Black Friday with Fancy price. I was hoping this will be a good choice but I think I made bad choice.  Here are the reasons1. Phone Signal: The phone displays very bad signal with ATT provider. I thought it will be provider issue and talked to them. They said this model has issues.2. No WIFI Calling Option: This Model is not USA ATT Phone Variant so this is not compatible with WIFI Calling. WIFI calling helps when the Signal is almost No or very weak. We can connect to the WIFI and then use that to make calls. This is completely gone. I had NOTE-5 and it was having good signal and WIFI on same places.3. Calls dropping: Called the Provider and they said same. It is the model issue and not Sim card issue4. After all these hassles, called ATT and asked for replacement SIM and adding the replacement SIM did not help.These are all the reasons that I dont recommend this to others. I am also going to call Amazon and see what options do I have to return.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow. After 3 days of using (without a single drop) I've noticed the camera's glass cover is cracked. Next day I am already having dust particles under it. Quick google and I see I am not the only one (there are many). I've noticed this last night after I left a warm building and on the outside it was pretty cold. The funny thing is that many other users with this problem noticed that the temperature difference might be the problem. And yeah, most of them have owned their samsung phones for only few days/weeks too. So it seems like if it doesn't happen to you in few weeks/months after buying then you are safe. I am extremely disappointed. I own old iphone SE, nexus 5 and iphone 4 where the last one is being used by my kid as a toy (!!) and non of these have broken either front glass or camera glass.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was an apple fan but since ios phones were getting so expensive every year I decided to give Samsung a try, which was a HUGE mistake. Dont get me wrong this is a nice looking phone the battery is great I can go one full day without charging it, heavy user. The screen resolution is awesome and the sound is great. But after 4 months my S9+ started to slow down and now it just doesn't respond at all.  the screen frequently freezes and and goes completely blank. I try to turn it on and off but it doesn't work and a message appears on my screen (I have attached a pic of the message).  I think I may go back to iOS.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered two of the galaxy s9+ phones at 256gb. When they arrived, they were the wrong ones at 128gb. This is something to be mindful of before you activate it with a carrier. I use my own straight talk. Even though they were the wrong phones, I decided to keep them anyway just because I already went through the process of switching it over to straight talk. The phones work great and I am happy for that. Not happy that they are not the 256gb like I paid for.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"After reading all the ""single starred"" reviews I was getting worried about my purchase. As soon as it booted up though, all my doubts vanished! The phone is so much more better than my old phone! I was using a BLU phone with only 8gbs of internal storage and really wanted an upgrade. And what an upgrade it was! The camera quality is splendid, the performance is remarkable, and the transition was smooth as silk. The battery life is hindered due to the always on function and the already implanted apps that run among Samsung's internal storage,but it doesn't bother me that much. I'm still learning of it's many capabilities, but all in all I'm not disappointed with it yet.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"After launching my Pixel 2 XL out of the passenger window in a fit of rage, I needed a new phone. I guess I didn't feel like rating the ""Waze"" app with 5 stars in heavy traffic. Anyways... I didn't really have too many requirements, the new phone needed a great camera and a display that wasn't smashed into 1349 pieces.This S9+ will be a hard phone to replace. The display is deep. The camera is arguably the best on the current market. Even Bixby can be disabled. It's not perfect but it's my daily driver for the moment.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"So excited! I received the phone today and it is amazing. It was very easy to set up. It has many new features (I had a Samsung7 and liked it) and the typing is more comfortable, because the screen is larger.I use Verizon, called them and they switched me in a short time to the new phone without a visit to the store. I put it on the charging stand I had for the S7, no problem. So far I am very happy with my choice.One week later: I love my new phone! Still discovering new features. As a former Photographer, I am afraid that the Photo Industry will take an other hit (film to digital) by the quality of the Camera on this phone. Excellent in every way!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"There are other reviewers who know a lot more about the technical aspects of the phone. I can say that my experience has been positive. I previously owned a Samsung Galaxy S5, so this was a significant upgrade for me. I love the look and feel of the phone. It's fast and responsive. I no longer feel like I have to delete every unnecessary app to keep the phone from freezing up and crashing. The battery lasts all day without charging (I used to have to charge multiple times with my S5 and if I was using heavily, I was tethered to power constantly or it would die). I am satisfied with the sound quality. I listen to a lot of music and podcasts. Anyone who has used Samsung phones in the past should have no problem adapting to this phone.I love the finger print and face recognition to unlock the phone and various apps. I also used the Samsung Pay feature for the first time today and that was fun and easy.  I do wish that I could get the home screens to wrap the way they did on my old phone, but that's the only thing I can think of that my S5 had that I can't do on this phone (and it's very minor).

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This came brand new completely wrapped in plastic down to the sides of the phone.  The people complaining about it being used clearly bought from a 3rd party seller.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I do not recommend getting this, or ANY Samsung device due to the sheer amount of crapware they install. It is impossible to remove this, without significantly changing the structure of the operating system.A few examples include: Galaxy Themes, requiring a Samsung account, remapping the Samsung Voice assistant (Bixby) is extremely difficult, and breaks between updates.One positive is DeX. Samsung's Desktop EXpericence is actually really cool.In conclusion, this is a very nice piece of hardware made very annoying by all of Samsung's attempts to ""improve"" on stock Android functionality. I will never made the mistake of buying another Samsung device again.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the fact that this factory unlocked Galaxy S6 plus phone is not dedicated to any one carrier. You do not get the non removable junk they install.

Even when I close all applications after use.Get this one. It is excellent.

Coming from Galaxy note 3 for which I paid 150 brand new. This is huge upgrade but still not worth 5 times higher price than what phones  used to  cost. Phone manufacturers have to understand that.

Also need to figure out the telephoto, it works great when I accidentally use it : )

3.0 out of 5 stars,"A year ago, I went with a Moto G5 Plus with Amazon's special offers. That phone was great. Excellent battery life, and an almost stock version of Android. Only downside was the cheap glass screen which cracked not even a month after I had it, and the mediocre pic quality. This time around, Amazon had a deal with the S9 and a free Echo Show (which I was able to hock on ebay). I was expecting leaps and bounds vs my old Moto. However I've been  somewhat disappointed. 1. The battery life sucks on this phone! I find myself having to throw it on a charger otherwise it will barely make it through a full day. 2. The fingerprint scanner is garbage compared to the Moto. I personally prefer the scanner on the front, but the S9 seems to have a delay that can be frustratingly annoying after a while. And yes I've taken multiple scans and re-scans of my prints. It does take nice pictures, and I love wireless charging and the secure folder feature. Other than that, I'm still on the fence. I may just send this one back to Amazon and order a g6.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Previously my phone was a Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime. I upgraded to the s9+ after about 4 years of use with the grand prime. This upgrade was worth it. My provider (Cricket Wireless) works with it and the picture, camera, and sound quality is phenomenal!! The best things that I like about it include the fingerprint scanner, the ability to shoot 4k video (limited to 5 minutes though), as well as the extensive amount of tools that can be utilized such as their network settings, the integration with google and samsung, and paired with a good screen protector and case, the durability. The only downside I could say is the battery through continuous usage. However at a decent set brightness, the phone can last almost at a full 24 hours using the optimized battery usage setting.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Very disappointed.  Purchased from Amazon Warehouse and apparently the phone was not inspected as the device was locked for use.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Phone is great, camera is great, it is also good looking.  Nevertheless, Bluetooth does not work with my car (VW Tiguan 2014) and apparently that is the case with many more car brands. You can check that yourself by visiting Samsung's support site and looking at the countless cases relating the same issue, across a variety of car brands and models. I owned an S7 that had the same issue, and was hoping that the S9 would have addressed that. I also owned an Iphone 7, that had flawless bluetooth performance. So, this is specific to Samsung issue. Samsung does not seem to care too much, since all those cases are poorly answered... with no solution. And remember: this has been going on since S7 (at least).. Samsung couldn't care less. Unfortunately I'm selling it and getting an Iphone instead. Too bad

Battery is long-lasting, fingerprint reader is great (works well even through a thick case, can be used to secure investing and banking apps), phone is fast, good storage, has a microSD slot.I would've loved an unlocked bootloader and replaceable battery, but most folks don't care about that so I'll give it 5 stars.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It is an awesome one!!!!! Now able to use it more easy yeah. The battery is lasting me much longer, if I do not use it all the time, I do not need to charge it until the the next. Is is easy to set it up and get all your data back on.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm in love with this phone. I was really hesitating between this Samsung that had amazing reviews or (yet again) buy a new iPhone. I used to think iPhones were the best smartphones on the market. Well, I'm happy to say I was proved wrong. This phone is really impressive, it works really smoothly and has an amazing camera, even for rookies like me. Don't regret the change from iPhone!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Galaxy S9 arrived in perfect condition, with all included accessories (purchased from Sales Pro 55). The phone itself is beautifully designed. The glass on the back is prone to fingerprints and not grippy at all, so a case is recommended. The fast charging works flawlessly and does make up for the slightly smaller battery on the S9 model (in comparison to the S9+). The performance is fast and snappy, and with Samsung releasing One UI in January, I'm anticipating continued fast performance in 2019. Overall, I would recommend this phone, but please be cautious of third-party sellers. Look at ratings before picking one.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this phone thinking it was a US model but is was not or it was a fake. I have since bought a real US model and it was very different from the AR emojis to whats in the box. To top it all off the mobile data wont work on the phone. After hours with tec support it still would not work. The real phone has android pie  This one came with a prior version of andriod.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was nervous buying this from an Amazon seller but now that I have had the phone a few days I am very pleased.Battery got hot the first charge but has been fine ever since. Accubattery App shows that the battery is working well. Beautiful design, vivid color and for less than you would get it from Verizon, anywhere else. Especially if you have Prime!!

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this S9+ last april and I have spent a month trying to reach customer support via amazon and no luck. The screen is burnt in and I read online that this is a common issue with the phone, and warranty applies. I hope by this mean I can be reached by a customer support representative since Amazon is not so helpful in this opportunity.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"My old S5 died so I finally broke down and got a new and holy cow, this difference is huge. The phone is wonderful. Looks good and is sleek. All the new features are great. The camera is AMAZING. I can't tell you how much I love it, Definitely worth it

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Phone arrived in full working order, with the model in description.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"The EMEI for the phone showed up on AT&T's list as ""Unknown Manufacturer"".  Spent 4+ hours on the phone with AT&T and talked with 5 representatives, but if it isn't on their list it won't work.  The EMEI was listed as ""Samsung"" on other external EMEI lists, but AT&T's internal list is the one that matters to AT&T.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sadly this phone DID NOT work with verizon but the folks at the store said AT&T may be able to unlock it.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not really into always buying the latest and greatest tech, which is why I bought the S9 at a decent discount as the S10 has been recently released.  I replaced my S6 active with this S9 and I am very impressed.  The S9 performs well with daily task.  With 1 charge, I usually have around 30% battery at the end of the day with moderate use.  I've had the S9 for about 3 month now with 0 issues and I dont regret my purchase.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good price for Amazon prime users. Also TV is great. One thing, BUY A GOOD PROTECTOR !! Also buy as much memory as possible so as too send photos too. Fast phone and lots of apps. Dont pay for iPhone, the $$$$$ is too high. Great pics and Amazon app to send pics to computer is a great addition. As a old fart it took me time to look at all the apps. Oh, get a good security program too. Well worth the $$ for Amazon prime members, mine was un-locked. Just a footnote, most ISP will have free downloads for security programs, YES, for the phone also

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got scared when I was reading the reviews after I already bought this because people were saying they only got a box, or the phone stopped working, or stuff was missing. But I am assuming these were all purchased from other sellers or refurbished or used. Amazon has all reviews from different sellers lumped into one. Got mine new from Amazon.com Services Inc. seller and it came with everything, including fast charger box and cable and headphones. Phone has been working excellent, great battery life.
            "

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ordered this unlocked Galaxy S9+ on Cyber Monday.  Got it for under $500.  Read a lot of the reviews on here and many said they got used phones or they weren't unlocked.  I took a chance and bought one anyways since I knew I could return it if it wasn't new or unlocked.  I couldn't pass it up for under $500.  Mine arrived and it was brand new and unlocked!  I took my Verizon sim card out of my S7 Edge and put it in the S9+ and powered it up and the phone had to do a quick download from Verizon and another reboot and then the phone was up and running.  I really notice the speed difference with the extra 2GB of RAM vs. the S7.  Hope this helps with anyone considering purchasing these unlocked phones and Happy Holidays!

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this phone, read reviews and the answers to the question if it worked on verizon, everyone said it does....well it doesnt. I took it into the Verizon store after I couldn't get it to work, apparently it's the wrong antenna (Verizon is CDMA and this isn't). Be careful
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the screen like everyone else does and also the music sounds good. Battery life is surprising good better than expected. But beware that you lose some options from from your service provider buying an unlocked phone. Also a bit too pricey but if you can afford it go for it...
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"a really great high-end phone, i love how clear it captures pictures in bright or in dark areas thanks to the Dual Aperture,the most important thing for me in a smartphone is its display quality which this gets right with its gorgeous displaysound is also very good on the studio speakers

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Came with an 86% charge and a screen protector on?? Feel like it might not be brand new but besides that it's been perfect. It is originally  at&t and needs the smaller sim card luckily I bought a cheap phone while waiting and it had the right size sim card.... the only thing is the battery doesn't seem right... it dropped 10% after one hour of use but it's still the first day. Could easily just be all the updates and crap
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Came perfect, well shipped and in original manufacturers packaging. I just had to take the sim card from my previous (Windows) phone and insert it into the S9+ holder. Configuration was very easy, I was new to this but I was 100% successful.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Samsung ""as always"" takes you above and beyond, I'm impressed with the quality of the phone and the many services that are designed to make you feel comfortable and connected. As for Bixby, I like Google assistant more, but it is good to have both services in one phone. I'm planning to leave the US and I'm not sure that the phone would be OK or locked for US providers only.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone. Upgraded from S5 and this is much better. I like the wireless charging and it has a long battery life. Much faster CPU and memory. Very responsive. More storage and sd card can be added as well. More comfortable in the hand and easier to use. Highly recommend if you have a S5,6, or maybe 7. If anything newer, you should probably get the S10.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought just after price drop.  Phone worked great, new in box as advertised.  No issues as some have claimed about returned/open box items.  Can't beat the features for the price either.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've seen various reviews before buying saying that they received only the phone w/nothing else on the box so when I ordered mine i was kind of scared to only receive the phone but I read to make sure what was in the box and it included everything the phone came w/ and I am now typing this on the new phone. I got everything and you should too. Great phone and its performance is amazing.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the ""New Condition"" Phone and it came in very mint condition and in its original Samsung box with all its accessories (i.e. AKG Ear buds, USB cord, USB connector, wall charger, SIM card ejector pin, instructions and manual). I am very satisfied with my purchase and I plan on purchasing another as a gift.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got the regular S9 with 128gb. The screen is curved and it is real fun to watch to videos on phone. The sound quality is amazing. Its powerful enough like some of the portable speakers. Beats iphone any day. Camera is fabulous. Pictures are crystal clear and true HD.Some drawbacks - Pictures take lot of storage space. I installed a sd card. But its wierd - sometimes the pictures go to card and sometimes on phone. Very random.  Another point to be noted is that since it is curved screen so you have to be very careful in selecting the cover/case else you will crack the screen on first fall.Otherwise, the phone is slim and sleek. Real stylish.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This phone is great! Very easy to use and figure out where to find the settings. It was very easy to activate with my Verizon SIM card and isn't loaded with all those useless apps that ""locked"" phones come with.
            "
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Samsung has removed the built in android transfer option. Setting up this phone and transferring your data and settings is infuriating. Considering returning the phone as this is arduous. The promises from samsung that their smart switch application will work with any android 4.1 or later phone is plainly false as the application is incompatable with my android 7.0 phone.Bixby is an annoyance that should be completely removed; google assistant already does a better job.Overall, this phone is nothing but an infuriating attempt for samsung to enforce brand loyalty by making ti painful to move to or from a galaxy device.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I took a long time choosing a phone; they cost so much now & I plan to keep this one for a long time. I also want to change service providers with my own phone. I really liked this Galaxy S9, but every time I read a negative review about S9s or S8s I had to chase down information proving or disproving it. I didn't know if I could afford an S9.  When I was ready, I chose this S9 in Orchid - I'd been watching it daily. The camera is as great as reviews everywhere say it is, and there are so many upgrades since my old S5 came out! I registered my new phone on Samsung.com  and it doesn't affect anything that I purchased my Unlocked phone from Samsung, not from a service provider. There are many misconceptions among the reviews and comments. It does use WiFi - for the web & for making phone calls. I saved money buying on Amazon. I couldn't have bought an S9 anywhere else. The seller was really great about responding to any questions I had; I'm glad I purchased my phone from them. This has been a really great purchase experience!
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Long story short.Wanted an unlocked phone just so i can switch carriers whenever i felt like it.I have sprint.Put in my sim card and was told that this phone would not work on sprint network....Called up sprint and also went to a sprint store,was told phone is locked and they could not activate it....My kid need's a new phone so i sent it to him( he has at&t).He was told that they could not port his number over to that phone(but they were able to give it a new number if he wanted to add a line)......so basically what he did was trade it in to at&t plus $200.00 and got a note 9 instead.........I think both companies did not want to activate a phone that was not purchased from them.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I read a few horrible reviews about not getting a new phone, and for the amount of money involved I was nervous but very happy when I opened the box to find a shiny new phone with all the parts it is supposed to come with.

I can't wait to start using it and learning all the cool features!!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't believe how good the quality of this phone is. I checked the screen and the body it's almost like new and works perfectly; just as described in the listing. I tested all functions and so far so good; is a replacement my mom's Note 5.As for the accessories, it came with the original fast charger, the USB to C connector.The AKG earbuds are...sigh, no good; missing the soft bud cushions so can't wear them at all. Didn't come with the sim slot opener.The box was sealed with tab and a label sticker showing it's Amazon Warehouse certified.I will update this post if something is up with the phone.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I may not have owned this phone for very long (I accidentally bought the Snapdragon version when what I really needed was the Exynos version) but the time I did own this phone was all I need to know how amazing it was. The size of the screen is just stunning, it just absolutely dwarfed my Samsung Galaxy S5. It's so light and easy to hold onto, that at no time did I ever worry about dropping it. Plus, there are plenty of phone cases you can buy right here on Amazon if you're worried. It's got plenty of memory, with the option to add a microSD card of up to 400GB to the phone to boost what it already has. The camera is just incredible, I was able to take pictures of my cat as well as wild squirrels and a few deer with quality like never before. Also, the customer service that Super Savings provides just goes above and beyond and then some. When they found out I had made a mistake with my purchase my offered me a full refund in a timely manner. They didn't get angry with me or try to embarrass me or anything of the sort, they were extremely cordial and helpful. I look forward to doing business with them in the future.

When I called Samsung Customer service, they say that this version is US only. There is something called Region lock and I am still struggling to figure out how to make it work in India. I am really frustrated spending so much a phone and doesnt work.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Before I ordered this, I read a LOT of the reviews. And after reading some horror stories (about people not receiving new phones or the box being empty) I was actually really worried something like that would happen to me too. I contacted the seller but never heard back from them (MizMaz), which did not help with my anxiety while I waited for the package.When I opened the box, the front screen protector film showed some fingerprints and there was no protector for the back of the phone. Otherwise the phone looked clean, and all of the extra things like charger were in the box. It has been working fine with T-Mobile, so that's great news, all we did was insert the SIM and that was it. Overall, if you are looking for a new phone but don't want to pay $1000+ for Galaxy S10, I think this is a great option. Will update the review if we encounter any problems in the future.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"While trolling apple for their phones, Samsung should keep in mind that their so called flagship s9+ starts malfunctioning barely after hitting a 30-day mark. I didn't waste $800+ money to buy a faulty product like this. Would never ever recommend to anyone

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just received the product 4 days before its delivery date. Due to the influx of good/bad reviews i decided to take a shot at it.

After about 30 mins of YouTube videos I was able to find how to correctly remove the prior account from the phone and set it up. So this is a -1 for the seller rather than the product

I am a Verizon customer. the phone initially came as a Sprint device. Verizon store was not able to help me activate this initially. It turns out the OS was from Nov 2018 and had to be upgraded before I could activate. Once I did this, I was on the phone with Verizon support for over an hour, with countless ""try this and reboot"" attempts.  It finally did work, but I put about 3 hours of my time into the activation.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I like my galaxy S 9+ very much, is very fast, takes awesome pics, sound it's great. My disappointment is that it doesn't have video chat, can't set up individual messages alert tones, can't set up wallpaper on messages, background is plain white, very boring. Besides that it is a good quality phone.
            "
3.0 out of 5 stars,"The service seems to be spotty with the S9. My S7 never had any issues with service area. There are certain areas in my home that have a bad connection or drop calls. Frustrating
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Was initially tempted by the Moto G6 or X4 but the S9, in addition to more sensors used in various application, has better processor, very good camera, microphone which are useful when used with Smule!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"No bad review or nothing out of the ordinary. The phone was exactly as I purchased it through Amazon, new and with all the accesories mentioned. It has good quality of sound and image.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"After reading some of the bad reviews, like others, I was a little nervous. Phone arrived overnight, appears to be brand new with all accessories (protective film on front and back of phone, accessories all wrapped, everything in box, but no actual seal on the box). Had to take into the T-Mobile store since my sim card was the older style large one from a Galaxy S5. They gave me a new sim (no charge), and after a firmware update and Smart Switch from my old phone in the store, all is good.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works perfectly on Verizon with a stop to get a new sim card for it. (My old one was a mini.  It takes a nano)  I just hope it lasts as long as my last Samsung phone.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have used android all my life. This is a very useful phone and love everything about it. I have trouble typing sometimes with my meaty fingers but that can easily be fixed by changing the keyboard style. Other than that it really is worth it. 3500 MaH will definitely last you all day. Sometimes I could be on my phone for 5 hours straight and it still be 45% or higher battery.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was expecting like a ""regular"" seal tape they would normally use you know.. the circle tape, but instead they had taped it straight top to bottom. I wanted a ""clean"" box so I tried to gently pull it off slowly. Of course I didn't come off nicely and torn the S9+ box cover. I'm not too happy with THAT, but hey... I still got the phone :/

The phone is beautiful and man I can't wait to figure it all out the resolution is insanely clear.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Only just received in the last day or so. Phone was new, in box, with all items described. Bluetooth file transfer works. Battery lasted a full 24 hours after getting a full charge. First phone call to husband to test phone had horrible static. Hung up and tried again and had no issue. Had several calls since with no issue. Speaker is good. Haven't used the camera much except to take some review photos. Quality is good.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm sure that the cell phone battery is defective, because normally a new cell phone usually lasts the battery at least the full day and in my case with normal use the battery does not last the whole day, I must charge it again in the middle of the day so that last until night

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone. Lives up to its qualities . Take amazing photos.  Actually is water proof o recommend getting butt plugs for it if you plan on taking photo in deep water. Everything about it was new . Battery life is a little weary I guess it depends on how much you use your phone I've had days where I dont use it and it stays at 90% and someday I dont use it and it's dying could be background app use but its provides weekly updates on battery use .. all in all great phone would recommend 100 %.. shipped as expected
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far love the phone.  Facial recognition lock is great and the fingerprint reader location is excellent and works better than my S7 did.Battery life is great, but it's a new phone so hard to judge that accurately at this time.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I live in Canada and I purchased this phone. It's an unlocked phone like it states. So it works for all providers. You dont need to worry about that. Dont let the model number fool you. The model number is the North American version. The ""1"" you see at the end, only means it's an unlocked phone. Everything was in the box. Excellent condition. And it actually arrived 1 day before expected. Its absolutely fantastic for its price. I saved like $300!
            "
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I will start this review by stating that I live in a very weak signal area no matter what device is used. This being said, I compared the S9+ to a Note 9 and a 50.00 LG. Very weak antenna compared to other phones! Tried 2 different 9+ both had same weak reception. I compared to Note 9 and a cheap LG - even the cheap LG had a stronger signal.

Not happy after being told it was unlocked for Sprint carriers.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"WARNING: If you want a protection plan that covers loss or theft, don't buy your phone on Amazon! I just bought this Galaxy S9 and I can't find any company that will sell me a protection plan which covers loss or theft.Asurion seems to only sell warranties through phone carriers, Squaretrade doesn't cover theft, and it looks like Verizon won't sell me the coverage because I didn't buy the phone from them, also I'm not on contract. I'll update this if I have any luck, I'll probably just end up returning this and buying a phone from Verizon, even though I am mad at them :(...

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'd like to start out by saying I've never had any of the previous galaxies, so I don't know how the S9+ companies to previous models. That saying, I absolutely love this phone. I recently switched to the Galaxy S9+ from the ZTE Axon 7 because of the limitations on that phone. The Axon 7 is a really good phone, and although it is an android, there are a lot of differences between that phone and Samsung Androids.The Galaxy S9+ has a great battery life, I charge it using the wireless fast charger in the morning before work and it will last all day through a 10 hour shift plus the gym. I like all the security features like the fingerprint scanner and face detection. It also has great memory and runs easily. I can do multiple things at a time and have multiple windows open and it's not a problem. The sound is also really good, I don't have to turn it up as loud to get the same quality music as with my old phone and the display for the screen is awesome. I take pictures and they look like they are in hd. By far one of my favorite features is the edge panel where you can put frequently used apps and contacts and such. I use that all the time.So far I have no complaints. I've been using this phone for about a month and I'm in love with it. Also buying it through Amazon using their store card and 24 month financing was a plus. That's the only way I could afford such a high price phone.I would definitely recommend this phone to someone else. I never rate anything 5 stars, but as of now the Galaxy S9+ is worth it.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Unlocked US version.  I simply swapped the SIM card from my iPhone to this one and ran Smart Switch.  Was up and running in under 30 minutes. Beautiful screen and decent battery life.  Works on the Verizon CDMA network and the data speed is noticeably faster than my previous iPhone 7+ on the same network.  Earphones that came with it sound great as well, which is a plus.  I have gone back and forth between Android and iPhone over the years.  My last Android was a Galaxy S5+ which was an energy hog.  Given the power of this phone I find the battery life impressive.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"The phone randomly disconnects from calls and internet.  It is unreliable and for a phone that I bought in October, the product support window closed on January 10th.  I guess they figured that since the phone will die in three months they should not offer support a minute beyond that.  Don't buy this unless you have disposable income.
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Used it for less than 2 months and it has started being kicked off the VZW mobile network. It no longer can be registered on the network, so it's totally useless. Amazon is charging a restocking fee. STAY AWAY, DON'T BY IF YOU WISH TO USE Verizon wireless service.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Im the kind of user that jumps from iphone to android, convinced that Android offers a lot more but the problem lies in components with each manufacturer. I only buy flagship smartphones as Im a power user and I decided to give it a go with the impressive S9.Im extremely happy.Im not getting into details and specs, the internet is already loaded with them, I think the experiences is more valuable to you.The device is top notch,  Migrating from another android device or an iphone is extremely easy with the included adapter,  screen is wonderful, no surprise considering Samsung builds the iPhone X screen. Well obviously Samsung is the screen guru nowadays.Everything is great on this device, works much better than iphone in bluetooth connections, is extremely fast etc.UI is very good, and packed with options. Fast charging is impressive, 10 to 100 in 60 mins. And battery lasts all day with normal use.Cellular signal strenght is very good, wifi is very good, its wather proof, what else can you ask for?

2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the worst top of the line samsung phone I have ever owned and how the heck you get any kind of replacement for this junk. restart on or 2 times a day because applications quit, screen flips out and goes where it wants instead of to the icon you press. Try to answer phone calls and you have to back out of all other screens and if you try to close all screens it shuts off the phone call. S9+ just plain sucks

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not an idiot... but this phone makes me feel like an idiot.  I purchased the phone via Amazon for my Verizon service 2 months ago.  It started having problems (randomly resetting etc).  I booted in SAFE mode and even attempted to do a factory reset.  The phone is in an endless boot cycle.  I've found that getting it serviced is a challenge.  Verizon couldn't help me, Calling Samsung directly couldn't help me.... they've told me to contact Amazon directly which I'm about to do.It's pretty obvious that the market couldn't sustain quality issues like this, so I think I got a lemon.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Fast, packed with customization, beautiful pictures. Occasionally I trigger the edges when I use it in landscape mode but that's not too big of a deal. I wish it was less of a headache to disable bixby. Even though I have an app that controls bixby, I still see bixby being triggered slightly before the new intended shortcut is triggered. If you're going to use a work profile on here, be warned that depending on your place of work you will not be able to use custom keyboards (understandably so). It's just a bit confusing when my s7 allowed the use of custom keyboards and the s9+ will not (both phones were used for the same job, don't know why the standards are different). Great phone, I'm glad I bought it and am having a better experience with it than the phones I've owned previously (Galaxy Note 4, Galaxy s7, Nexus 7, Pixel XL, Moto X).Update September 5, 3018Lowering the rating for this. It's only been a few months but I'm already starting to have battery issues. I went from not managing my battery too much to constantly needing to charge and top off my phone. I've started to have a strange charging issue where my phone won't fast charge even though its reporting that its doing so. The only charger that I've found to somewhat efficiently charge my phone is an unmarked charger I got from work. Otherwise it takes forever to charge even to 70%. I have yet to contact a Samsung service center but will am afraid I'll need to. I've tried ever trouble shooting method short of master resetting my phone. After experiencing these issues with the s7 a while back I'm thinking I might go away from the galaxy line at this point. Will report back if I'm able to fix the issue, such a pain.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"(It still gets 5/5 stars because the phone was functioning perfect, just doesn't work on Sprint)Okay, so after trying to activate the first one at Sprint, they said the phone was either the international version (it doesn't appear to be) or it was locked (also doesn't appear to be). So, Amazon was super helpful in exchanging the phone for another, saying the serial numbers must have been confused.  I try to activate the second one, and run into the same exact issue.  Sprint does NOT have the IMEIs of these phones on their list of eligible devices, regardless of everything (model/unlocked/unbranded) pointing to this phone being eligible.  Other carriers experience may vary.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the S9 directly from Samsung.com, and wow was that a huge mistake. I got the phone, switched over my service with Verizon and sent the old phone off for credit. The next day I noticed the S9 had some minor physical damage from shipping. I was going to let it slide but thought, nah, I just bought this thing, its on them to fix it.Samsung refuses to do anything but a refund for sending back the phone. I cant be without a phone, my business depends on me talking to clients. I asked them to send me a new one and ill return the defective one once i switch my service over. They refuse. I'm blown away. Had I bought the phone from Amazon, Best Buy or, hell, even Verizon, they would have given me that option. I tried talking to managers, I tried using chat, email, nothing works.The phone itself inst bad, but Samsung customer service is disgusting. This is coming from a guy who has their 75"" QLED TV, Family Hub Smart Fridge, touchscreen washer and dryer, and literally everything else Samsung offers.You lost a customer for life, and i loved you guys. What a sad way to go.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Too many missing features. You enjoyed having custom notification sounds for individual e-mails? Too bad, ""we're working on getting that feature back to you."" You want the Samsung e-mail app to automatically show you e-mails from longer than 6 months ago? Nope, you'll have to do a search. Does your VIP have more than one email address listed in his contacts? Oh, we'll just split them into two separate contacts when you import them into the email app! Oh, you want that person to show as only ONE contact? Too bad, that feature isn't available!Honestly, the downgraded features make this ""upgraded"" phone average at best. Pay a premium price, get a standard phone. Great job, Samsung. I'll update this with a better review IF they put back these integral features.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"The keyboard on this phone is horrible no matter what you change the settings to or how large you make the keyboard. The phone is not as advanced as an iOS when working with other apps cutting and pasting, sharing, or simply managing pictures and contacts on your personal computer. I could have dealt with tha t but the keyboard was simply not functional. You have an added fingerprint scan to open apps but you will ah e to log in and reset frequently. DON’T FORGET YOUR PASSWORDS!  At any given time you will be required to log in manually more often unlike the iPhone.

I hope Samsung will improve this issue with an update as soon as possible. Bixby button sucks. Portrait mode  cam is not so good as iPhone X.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this phone to replace the BLU R1 HD and let me tell you it is a fantastic upgrade! I have yet to delve I to all of the software features of the phone yet but as an all around every day use phone, it's amazing! I tested the slow motion video out while I was in Wyoming for A.T. and it works like a charm (except for in totally dark settings, as there's not enough light to activate the feature). Should I have waited a few more months for the S10? Maybe but I don't regret this purchase as it's an amazing phone well worth the price. Will update this review once I've had it for six months.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"The Samsung bloatware is outrageous and there is no way to remove it. You can disable most of it but it then still nags you to use it.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Probably the best phone I've purchased in a long time. Would definitely recommend to someone looking for an upgrade, especially if they don't want to pay more for similar performance on something like, say, the iPhone X. I almost bought an iPhone, and after looking at them both I decided to go with the S9 and I am glad I did. The display is pretty awesome, nice colors, and the storage capacity is great, as well as the added benefit of adding an sd card for extra memory. The speed of the phone is high, even if you have a lot of apps open, probably due to the 4 gb ram. Superb performance overall. Impressed me for sure.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded from the s5, and I can tell you that the phone is the best phone on the market currently. I've been a loyal Samsung customer for years, and when I hold a phone for long term use I really keep it until something is worth purchasing. Where the iPhone lacks the S9 Plus makes up for. The Ram, expandable storage option of 400 GB's, and beautiful display, & somewhat ok price(the more advance the more expensive technology will be) places the phone already ahead of many phone companies. Samsung truly improved upon the phone, and I can say I'm satisfied.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!!! Samsung S9 has a useless battery. I can literally see the battery life decreasing right before my eyes. It doesn't last a full 8-5 normal use. That's without any use of videos and Spotify. The phone is fast, amazingly fast. But not worth the money. Def, not worth it.A phone must be able to go through a day without running out of battery.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the lilac purple phone Sunday afternoon and it was delivered Monday morning. The phone was new, no damages as others have talked about , with all parts and accessories included like you would get if you purchased it from Samsung.com. I also chose the bundle which included a 128 GB mini SD card as well as a Fast Wireless Charger stand. The bundle was at no extra cost so the price was $839 plus tax. Great deal if you ask me.  I am coming from a Samsung Note 8 and there are minor upgrades from the Note 8 but those minor upgrades was worth me buying the S9+ . The phone is snappy, the sound due to the dual speakers makes a world of a difference. The camera is better than my Note 8 and the AR emojis are fun. Once the Note 9 comes out, I will be sure to compare that against the S9+ but in the mean time, I will switch between this S9+ and my Note 8 as my daily driver. (Its something about the S pen on my Note 8 that I can not let go. Great phone. I would reccomend this device.
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I received this phone and out of the box, I felt it would be a hard phone to keep a hold of if your hands are damp. I also had some issues within the on screen keyboard. I did like the fact that you could tel the phone to play a notification tone while on a call. I also like the fact you could turn off the call connected/disconnected tones.The phone also has some other things I just can't live with. The phone would play a notification tone whenever I would connect an Bluetooth keyboard and or a hard wired keyboard to it. I couldn't find a way to turn that off. I contacted Samsung and they told me that is just the way the phone works and there wasn't a way to turn that off. US customer service from Samsung in my thoughts is lacking at best.I also got the Notification tones when I turned on/off the Voice Assistant for blind people to use the phone. Thhen on top of that, when using the voice assistant, I couldn't get the caller ID to repete it would only say it once and that was it. I tried quite a few caller ID programs and none of them worked when using a Bluetooth headset to get the caller ID to speak every 5 seconds or so. Without a headset connected by Bluetooth, they worked.The finger commands for there voice assistant for the most part don't work while on a call. Example: if I'm not on a call with voice assistant running, I could triple tap with two fingers and get status information like for time, network, WiFi etc... While on a call it says nothing. Same way with a lot of the other commands they don't work.To me for a blind person, I would stay away from this phone as the way it currently is.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Galaxy S9 is Samsung's 2018 flagship phone that currently runs on Android's latest version. This device is powered by Qualcomm's 2018 845 processor. There is a headphone jack and a USB C port that charges the phone from 0% to 100% in 1 hour and 45 min. The phone has 3 buttons: a power button, a volume control button, and Samsung Bixby (voice assistant) button. One of the biggest changes from the S8 is the camera. The S9+ has a dual camera that performs well in low light. Some of the camera modes include auto, video, hyperlapse, super slo-mo, and food. The camera produces amazing images and 4k 60 fps video. For unlocking the phone you can use a pin, password, pattern, fingerprint, iris, or face. The phone has wireless charging that allows you to lay the phone on a pad without plugging it in. The curved screen on this phone is phenomenal. One interesting inclusion to the phone is a heart rate monitor that is next to the camera. This can be used in the Samsung Health app. The phone is thin and light and has a great feel. Samsung has done a great job with the S9. The S9 is a great price phone that I highly recommend.

5.0 out of 5 stars," Smoothest Samsung experience, truly the market leader for Android. Used Xperia Z2 and LG G5 each flagships of their times, paid full release amount for both phones. Best experience so far. I used Wave II and Samsung Corby (was disappointed with both) gave Samsung a chance with Gear S2, got impressed hence tried S9+ refined software and redifned flaws of innovation in any successfull flagship. I didn't have it delivered but it's an awesome device!!!

3.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first bought the Galaxy S9 (thru Xfinity Mobile), I was very much impressed with its graphics, camera, and just overall sleek design. The OS is very responsive and easily adaptable. And for its price, I find it to be a great quality phone. Unfortunately, if I couldve done things differently, I would've bought an S8. It seems, that as a new model, there are still kinks that Samsung needs to work out.The battery is VERY WEAK. It doesn't even last half a day (12 hours) with moderate use. Also, the design can sometimes make the phone screen very easily crackable because of the raised edges (the phone case that I had bought could not protect the phone when it fell to the ground).
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a Galaxy S7 ans Iphone 8 and purchased both a Galaxy S9 and S9+ ... The camera on the Samsung destroys all of Apple's product offerings. That was one of the main reasons in getting the phone. I still think the Apple OS is far superior to Android, and there are glitches galore. turned off all notifications but still can get an app or two which will notify even when do not disturb is put on. Here is the odd thing, the S9 that I have seems to preform much faster and have a better camera than the s9+ on several occasions I used both and there was a huge difference in speed and pic quality. I would take the S9 over the S9+ screen seems sharper and the larger size is not worth is, horrible Bixby feature! My Galaxy S7 made me a Samsung Customer, the S9 is making the Apple 8 seem more appealing and I prefer the aspect ratio of the screen on the apple. Speakers are better on the Galaxy. For the price through, the Apple is the better phone except for the camera.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I went for ""premium"" by getting an S9+, but am rather disappointed.  First, there's huge amounts of bloatware.  I ended up disabling over 200 packages on the device that I didn't need/want.  Then, I couldn't ""root"" it.  Hey, it's my device; I should be able to do whatever I want with it including putting on a custom ROM.  The curved screen is actually a negative - I can't get a good screen protector for it.  Finally, the S9+ screen is actually smaller than the Nexus 6P I had before.  Going back to a Google phone next time.  I loved them in the past, and am kicking myself for changing.
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Lets start with the positives. It's fast, its responsive, the camera is good, ample storage and USB-C. Also has a headphone jack which is sadly scarce in 2018Now the negatives. The biggest one is the rounded edges of the display (and the reason why I will probably be selling this phone). they make it impossible to hold the phone with one hand, as it will ALWAYS detect your palm as an imput and mess up the touch sensors. It also gives a warping effect for any video being watched, so the edges are always deformed. Also this screen scratches way too easy, I have only had it since April and the screen is already scratched to the point where its intrusive. Had a note 5 since launch day and it had not a single scratch on the screen, vs this which was getting scratches within a few days of getting it.Now lets talk about bixby and the bixby button. Bixby is a waste of space, as the original siri worked better. Not to mention google assistant also is on the device, which works a lot better. Now when I tried to bind google assistant to the bixby button, but this is the next issue, you can't remap the DEDICATED HARDWARE BUTTON. I thought samsung would of learned from the S8 reviews, but I guess they didn't. Don't worry, they made it to where you're able to ""disable the bixby button"" where basically it puts it on a 3 second press rather than a tap, and otherwise remains active.Now for just some things that don't classify as ""negatives"" but I just personally don't like. The 18:9 or properly called 2:1 just seems weird, and it pushes the top buttons a little too high for convenient use I have decently large hands but still finding myself straining my thumb to hit drop down menus or open notifications. Also 99% of video content is 16:9 or 21:9, making 18:9 weird for bothI also prefer the dedicated hardware buttons of the older galaxies, as you either hide them, which means in order to have a home button you need to swipe up. It is always popping up rather than having me scroll when I swipe up, which gets incredibly annoying extremely quickly. The other option is to lock the buttons to the screen, which just makes no sense, as not only do you waste battery powering them (since they are white with a light gray background), but you also get burn-in since its an oled display. Also at that point whats the point in onscreen buttons, you could just have physical buttons that work better and allow front fingerprint scanners.All in all there are some very strong positives about the phone, but they get completely outweighed by the negatives imo.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I only gave 3 stars because this phone did not come with a Sim card tray. It just has a gaping hole where it should be. So when I took it to Verizon to get my number and info transferred to it, they couldn't do it. There wasn't one loose in the box anywhere, so it just didn't have it. I searched the many reviews for this item and I didn't see anyone else mention this problem, so maybe my phone was an anomaly for not having the sim card tray. Anyways, I had to order one online and once it arrives I can get my info transferred and test out the phone.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned two Samsung phones I don't know why I bought an s9 after I got my s5. The s5 as it received updates it would run slower and the battery life would barely last 4 hours after 1 year. I have now had my s9 for 4 months and it is starting to go down the same path. The worse part is I try to refuse the updates but now Samsung forces them upon you. I contacted them for help and all they said was we recommend you do them and then nothing more. I bought an Android because I thought I would have freedom of software use and to refuse updates, that is no longer the case. Next phone will be an apple iPhone where you can refuse updates and they have better privacy protection.

Otherwise, I just got the vibration and ""aaagh). Again. It was nothing I had done or not done.  Called Carrier - again - Consumer Cellular - and was told to do something you could not do to this phone - hard shock - was told to take it to Target. I did not get it from Target. Got a Supervisor - we did a Master Reset. After that, I could not even use it as a phone. No texting. No phone calls.#2 phone. Messes with my files. Ringtones won't work with texting - unless I'm talking -  the battery bleeds like nobody's business. I don't game. I don't bank. I just got the bloody thing because my J7 went bad... and I wanted a larger screen.  This thing tells me that the ""badges"" will show with I receive a message or phone notification. They don't.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Beware, this unlocked phone does not have advanced calling or video calling capability.  Went from a S7 to this S9 & went backwards in features.  The seller info should declare these deficiencies in their sales pitch.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros:Everything an expensive phone should have (great camera, display, sound, processing speed, etc)Headphone Jack!Micro SD slot (memory expandable up to 400gb)!Available for pretty much any carrier I can think of in the USA (unlike other great phones like the One Six Plus)Android OS so more options for those of us that like to mess with devices (and lots of great apps not available on iOS)Very good looking phoneSuper fast data usageSuper fast fingerprint unlock""Mehs"":Battery lifekeyboard a tad laggy imo (can be improved or even changed if you mess around)Bixby (has soo much potential, but it kinda sucks rn, and that bixby button... WHY)A few apps should have a bit more optimization when compared to iOSAR Animoji isn't as good as the iPhone X's version (I mean, idc; but some might lol)Face recognition is meh compared to the iPhone X'sCons:PRICE... This, and the iPhone 8 and X are too expensive... I still bought it, but still... (if you're tight on money, buy an S8 or different new good android phone. And if you're really tight, buy a good used S something or sort of recent iPhone)Fragile, had to buy a case and screen protector day oneLike 2 bloatware apps but you CAN remove them thankfullyOverall, I don't think I'll ever pay 800+ for a phone again even though I keep mine for three years before I replace; I'd rather do something better with that money. However, it's a damn good phone and I do recommend it if you keep your phones for a while or you're someone that needs the best phone every year. Compared to the X that some of my friends have, this phone is better imo. The X does do a few things better, but I still personally prefer the S9. Coming from an iPhone 5s, it's obviously a HUGE leap for me in terms of phones lol. If you're like me and want to try Android rather than going back to iOS, buy a good phone like this one (or the Huawai P20 PRO, One Six Plus, basically a good android phone) and you won't regret it. Will I stay with android and/or Samsung in three years? I don't know, but if things keep getting better as they are right now for android, I sure damn will. :)

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned Apple products for over 10 years now and loved them at the beginning. I thought I would never switch to another product, but with the increasing price and little new innovation on the new products I decided to try a new product. I came across Samsung and after much research I decided to try them out. I got the Galaxy S9 and all I can say is WOW! The camera is amazing I can take high quality pictures and adjust the lighting to fit the background, the battery life lasts forever I go 2 days minimum without having to charge it and I am on it constantly. The Face ID and fingerprint are great, I can even use the Face ID in pitch dark and it works! Storage is unbelievable I store over 7k pictures and still have room for apps and lots of contacts! Overall this is such a great phone I can honestly say I will never go back to Apple.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Samsung does not care about customer satisfaction. For them customer-centric culture is a very foreign idea.  This is my experience. I will never buy Samsung electronic device again and will convince all my friends and family to avoid that trainwreck also.Bought this phone new in July 2018, at Best Buy. Phone started to act up couple months later, not taking up the charge, finally turning into a brick. And since then it was a road through hell of Samsung (questionable) quality and dealing with the worst customer service I have ever encountered... It is unbelievable, because I expected Samsung to be on par with Apple, but boy, am I disappointed!So - it has essentially been the following cycle: would not take charge -- repair (2 weeks) - would take charge for a day, then would not take charge - - repair (2 weeks) - would take charge for a day, then would not take charge - - repair (2 weeks) - would take charge for a day, then would not take charge - then I finally decided to call customer service again, but demanding refund, being fed up with this whole brand altogether. It's been quite a ride with those guys, too! It took them first a few days to reply, oh sorry, I take it back - to do nothing, then I called last Friday (12/07) demanding refund again. Then I was told 48 hrs for decision. Then nothing, so I called Wednesday, after 72 hours and was escalated to someone else who told me it is up to five days, so I need to wait until Friday 12/14 (today) and they'd call me with the decision. So I waited till Friday's late afternoon because - of course - nobody called, and after being elevated again, spending about 2 hr and demanding information, I was told the phone cannot be refunded, not even exchanged! Only repaired again (because they have policies that say that main board has to be replaced). Next week I was supposed to get this phone on an international trip. Now I am stranded without one, I just haven't got some $700's around to buy new phones anytime I feel for it.It is unbelievable that they have some unrealistic policies and it does not matter that phone breaks 4 times (the same thing) and they would not replace it, let alone refund it, cause ""it wasn't motherboard"". My communications with even 2nd level manager was just as that - pointless. Banging my head against the wall of some corporate baloney - rather than being cared about as a customer who does genuinely get hit by their product poor quality.GO FOR iPHONE INSTEAD!!!  Maybe the phones aren't Androids but at least they have some true customer service out there!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an iphone X but I sold it for this. The iphone x was a huge disappointment. I used to buy nothing but apple products, but I realized how far behind apple is. This phone has a much larger display and higher quality than the x. Plus there is no annoying top notch at the top. The camera is better, I took pictures on both phones and the samsung was the only phone to pick up the fine print from a picture on my wall standing 12 ft away. The iphone x was blurry and the print wasn't legible. This phone has an incredible aperture to take crisp pictures even in low light. I don't believe its oversaturated, it all depends on what area of the screen you tap on and the phone will adjust the colors accordingly. Overall this phone probably has one of the best cameras on the market.The specs are good, you'll be able to multitask without any issues.The battery life is about average for me, it's not as much as I would like but it's not terrible either. I use my phone a lot for business, emails, video etc.. it gets me through the majority of my working hours around 7 hours of on screen time.Coming from an iphone user this is much better!

4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great phone with a lot of cool features and a top-notch camera, but I could do without Bixby and the overwhelming number of useless apps on it.  In addition, price-wise, it is not exponentially better (10X) than the BlackBerry Z10 that I switched over from and suffers from the following issues that take it down a notch:-Google Play doesn't download the album art if you transfer music over from your computer. It's not the end of the world, but the Z10 wasn't missing any album covers in its library.  I downloaded a pay-for-play music player and pushed Google Play to the next page because I wanted whatever album art I could get.  Without it, I find it kind of bland.-I am astounded as to why e-mails, phone calls and texts are all in different places. The S9+ should have a hub ""stream"", similar to the Z10.  I found that I needed to download the BlackBerry Hub for Android feature because it provides the user with one stream of e-mails, phone calls and text messages.  BlackBerry Hub for Android is the best thing since sliced bread and it is available either free (without ads for 30 days and with ads after that), and 99 cents a month (without ads), thereafter. From the human factors perspective, this is something that Samsung should be offering, especially at its advanced rate of development.-When a calendar event opens, there's no option to ""snooze"".-Playing music with earbuds was a little disappointing. The BlackBerry Z10 had a built-in optional booster and the sound quality was much better with richer bass, even with a $10 pair of earbuds.  The S9+ DOES have very good speaker sound, though.I bought this phone because I thought it was time to upgrade to an Android-based device that could run more apps, especially from the proprietary BlackBerry O/S that is going or gone extinct.  The S9+ is a very nice phone, but it is a little lacking and not flawless.  I am one that will probably not use it to play Pokemon or for any gaming.  The core features I use it for are phone, e-mail, music and some Android apps.  It's nice having a phone that can do the latter, but it would also be nice to have the best of both worlds.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Like many products these days it's all about the marketing and hype.  I've had the phone now for over a month.Pros:Speakers are loud and clearHeadphone amp is 1.4x more powerfulSome interesting tweaks in audio for Dolby Atmos, tube amp, etc.Display is outstandingCons:Bixby button is an annoyance. The placement is such when you use the power button you hit the Bixby button which IMO is a useless feature.Samsung bloatware.  Knox, Samsung music, gallery, etc. Compared to Google and what's on play I just want to delete them but can't.OS updates!  The half-hearted joke is if you want an updated OS, buy a new phone.  This includes security updates.Samsung should concentrate their efforts on updating the OS and security and forgo the lousy Samsung apps.Would I recommend the phone.  That depends.  If you love audio, then yes this is a good choice.  If you want updated software, speed and smooth opertation I would look elsewhere.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Literally the best phone I've ever had, I loved it so much I decided to upgrade to the S9 Plus version. Here's my layman's review on both.PROs:- The night photos are where this phone shines, definitely able to get every detail possible in low lighting.- Battery life is massive with both phone: S9 has a 3000mAh / S9 Plus 3500mAh- Plenty of RAM: S9 has 4gigs/ S9 Plus 6gigs. Both perform very extremely well but 6 gigs worth of RAM seems like overkill as 4 gigs from the S9 suffice with little to no slowdowns.-  Headphone jack on both version. Also comes with some sweet AKG earbuds.- AR emoji is relatively fun and great to show to people interested in checking out the phone- Thin phone- 4k Video quality- Great Speakers- Samsung Pay, literally can be used anywhere that accepts Cards as it mimics the magnetic strip (Not like Google Pay that relies on the ereader).- Live Translations with Bixby Vision- (Plus Version)  Live photo mode. Really great feature, and editable-  (Plus version) 2 Rear Cameras with optical zoom at 2x and digital at 10x, and dual captureCONs:- While night photos are amazing, daytime photos can sometimes appear overly saturated.- There isn't a noticeable size difference between both phones.- What is the point of Bixby? Really difficult to incorporate it into my daily life without actively thinking ""I should give Bixby a try""- While thin, it's somewhat heavy.- Besides the camera, there isn't a massive difference between S9 and S9 Plus.VERDICT:As stated above, I love the S9 so much I upgraded to the Plus version. Both phones run extremely fast with little to no slowdown, even having several apps open does little to bog it's performance down. Photos look fantastic at especially at night with both versions. My only issue is the new Bixby button: it's not something I would actively use but at least users can disable this feature. Overall it's a lovely phone, S9 works just as well as the S9 Plus but lacking a few features with the camera.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone. No problem there. Problem is that this particular phone from this particular vender is a Sprint phone and will not work to full capacity on Verizon network. In particular, the voicemail icon for Verizon does not work on this phone. There is no icon for voicemail.  I called Verizon about it and they said that since the phone was made as a Sprint phone, there is nothing they can do about it. In trying to help me out, Verizon told me that they could not do a shared screen process to figure out the problem. I am not willing to spend this much money on a phone with so much potential only to discover that the phone was made for the wrong company by whom I receive service.  I will be returning this phone to get a Verizon compatible phone.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a typical Samsung Flagship phone. It is well built and feels premium on hand. The picture quality is great. Shoots even better in low light. This phone has A LOT of features and can be quite complex. Blue Light filter, Dolby Atmos, Edge light, Always on and more. I am a simple guy and have never found these features useful. But slowly I started playing with them. Definitely useful but not must have.Why did I give 3 stars?Too much Samsung bloatware and the Bixby button is hell of annoying. The fingerprint and face recognition are not reliable. Face recognition rare works. The phone battery tends to die over night in standby mode if I only have 10% left.--Update after a year--The battery is horrible. Barely getting 2-3 hours on screen a day. I had to charge 2-3 times a day. Not going to buy a Samsung again.
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Phone frequently starts talking out loud (even if in your pocket or bag) because the dedicated had button pushes up against something. You can follow on-line instructions to disable the voice talking, but every time the phone auto-updates the operating system (which is forced upon you), the ""Bixby voice assistant"" is reverted to default mode. So, phone starts talking out loud at random times again.Do EVERYTHING you can do to avoid this phone. Do NOT buy any phone with ""Bixby"" associated with it. Samsung thinks it's smarter than you, so they took away your ability to disable the voice thing permanently, and they made it impossible to re-purpose the additional button for anything. Total garbage.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Had problems activating it through Verizon but finally got it.  Great camera.  Pretty much the same as a  S8 with a few cool upgrades.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"If you've already used or owned an S8, the S9 is going to be a very familiar device.  Same-fish design, same glorious Samoled display, same 18.5:9 aspect ratio, etc. Dont expect a drastic change from the S8 going to this phone.However, there are improvements such as a dual aperture camera, which isn't an apparent change at first until you dive into pro mode, a stereo speaker setup with the earpiece finally playing media when watching videos or playing games, and a better fingerprint sensor location. The bottom chin of the phone is also a bit smaller than it is on the S8 so there's a little asymmetricism going on when you rotate the phone sideways but hey, no dumb notch right? Samsung's skin is still drastically different from Google's vision of Android but serious work done with the s8 to improve performance is still present and I actually prefer the aesthetics of Samsung Experience, the new name of the software skin compared to stock vanilla android Oreo.Only downsides I can see are still average battery life and the general use of gorilla glass 5, which is more shatter resistant but quite a bit easier to scratch. There's two or three microscratches along the front glass though it's just the oleophobic coating and it's nowhere near the sensors, not to mention it's hard to see. That might just be me though as I'm rockin' the phone naked. Curved glass is also pretty much just for aesthetics and having an option to not have them or at least just have small curved edges would be more preferable but not a big issue for me.Either way, the S9 is a definite option to consider if you're planning to upgrade to a new phone anytime soon.EDIT: added more photos

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought 2 Samsung Galaxy S9 back in March from Samsung.com.My first issue was when they charged me for my exchanged S7 device that they claimed had physical damage but from the pictures they provided showed nothing more than normal wear. Calling and calling did no good to get anything done and just run around in circles.  They couldn't even provide the IMEI of the returned device to prove it was even the one that I sent to them.I went to sell my Samsung Galaxy S9 because I was so mad from this experience.  I sold the phones that should have been unlocked since I paid full price for the phones.  But the phones were locked to T-Mobile and T-Mobile couldn't unlock them.  I called Samsung and they couldn't unlock the phones either sending me in circles.  I asked the reps why they would send me a phone I paid full price for locked and why they wouldn't unlock the phone.Samsung has the worst customer service and I highly recommend getting a Google Pixel or another Android device.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I gave it 4 stars because there is no perfect phone, if there was they wouldn’t need to keep creating new models. I purchased mine elsewhere but exact same model and love the slim design. I’m comparing it with my present iPhone 7+. I’ve only had the Samsung 9 for 7 hrs but it’s definitely top quality. However, I paid $600 but got a $200 rebate from a little known and new website called invisible dot com.  It gets better, their plan is unlimited and on Verizon, and truly unlimited, and no data threshold where it throttles down. It starts and stays at 5mbps the entire time period but it’s great for streaming HD and works as a hotspot. Lastly make sure you buy a radiation proof cover not just an RFID one, the radiation from 4G is proving to cause tumors  especially with Bluetooth earpiece and 5G is even worse, lookit up.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"S9 could be a wonderful phone but the OS sucks at this point. Phone OS traps you in delete mode for both messages and email, only way out is shutting the phone down and repowering up, at least once a day. Additionally phone comes bloated with google everything with permissions for way too much. Settings are multi layered and manual is useless, eventually you can modify settings to meet your needs, if you do not it is setup to eat battery power, and data at amazingly high rates. If they can get the delete traps fixed then the phone would be acceptable or maybe amazing, can’t see that yet. Maybe after they do some more fixes. I have had two system upgrades so far..... hoping for some sanity and stability soon..... please

2.0 out of 5 stars,"The S9 Plus is nearly as silly as the Iphone. Samsung has managed to make an impractical phone that looks sexy. For starters, the battery is glued in! Three replacement batteries kept my old S5 alive for many years. Now I'm looking at $100 to replace the battery in the S9 Plus. Ouch!What's with those curved edges! My screen already has a couple of scratches and I still can't find a screen protector that doesn't piss me off. At this rate, I'm going to need another phone in 6 months... but perhaps that's what Samsung is hoping.It's not all about length; it's how you use it! When holding the S5 in one hand, my thumb doesn't reach to the top of the screen; it's now a two-handed device. Plus (pun intended), it's too long for my jeans pocket and it jabs into me when I bend at the waist.It takes great pictures. Other than that, I'm missing my S5.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I decided to move to Android after 5+ years with Apple. Main reason I bought the s9+ was the camera.You can get along with the Android way of doing things, but what really pissed me of was when I tried to backup the photos I took in my Macbook.Actually I have *returned* this phone after struggling an entire day searching an easy way to backup pictures on my Mac.After trying 5 different apps (including some weirdo chinese apps), trying with an SD card and everything, it was clear to me that this phone integration with a Macbook was a big NO for me. Oh, did I mention that some of the files got corrupted when I moved from internal storage to Micro SD?
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pro:Fingerprint sensor works like a charm.The quality of the photos is beyond top notch.The phone fits well in my hand and doesn't feel bulky.It comes with plenty of storage, which can be expanded with SD cards.Price range won't break the bank and gives you a quality phone.Cons:Get a case for it. The back of the phone can get marked up rather easily.The battery drains annoyingly quick, Even with battery saver options on. It's the biggest and only real flaw of the phone and I wish the battery saver options were a bit more open to allow you to pick and choose what you want to do.Overall, I enjoy the phone and if having a longer battery life is a must then I'd recommend getting the S9 Plus because the battery life is quite a bit better. Other than that, It's everything I want in a phone.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had the iPhone XS for 2 weeks. Returned it because I thought 1k was too much. Got the galaxy S9 Plus for 250 less. I LOVE IT. The resolution is amazing. Fast, smooth. I found there isn't really anything the iPhone can do that the S9+ can't, but there were a lot of things the S9+ could do that iPhone couldn't. Why people pay MORE to get LESS phone is beyond me. . USB-C... headphone jack, the resolution, NFC! Great phone, no regret. Using the $250, I got the samsung galaxy watch...Win.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just opened the box a half hour ago, The phone is brand new. I brought the phone for my boyfriend’s birthday and this is the cheapest I’ve seen the phone after searching for a week. I chose the 2 day delivery which was pricey but worth it because it came a whole day early. I didn’t use the phone yet but I did  turn the phone on and it sounds good and looks good!

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this phone as an ""upgrade"" to my wife's Google Pixel phone. (Actually my son got her Phone when his HTC M8 died.) Anyway, it's the second worst phone she's owned - and we have to go all the way back to the Motorola Photon to beat the miserable user experience provided by the Samsung Galaxy S9. As usual, Samsung has placed the albatross of bloatware heavily upon the otherwise promising hardware. I'd root it in a minute if she'd let me.
            "
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't buy!!  Two things are good... the touted good camera and processor speed. Sound is marginal and maybe worse than previous issues.  It is NARROW, terribly so such that 1/3 of my time is spent correcting misspelled words no matter what keyboard I try. Yes typing on the horizontal position is ok, but awkward and you have to use 2 hands. Samsung dropped individual text notices and so now EVERYTHING sounds the same when notified making you pull out the phone, unlock it, then find out what the notice was for... drivel!! At least weekly I have to restart the phone for the dail numbers to work, otherwise it does not put calls and texts through. The screen touch is over desensitized with a screen protector sometimes requiring multi-touches to respond even when in the sensitive mode.  It reminds me of Microsoft's Mellium PC format.
            "
3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Galaxy S9 is a great looking and working phone, but I challenge you to try to figure out all the camera features they show in the commercial.They show all sorts of things like 'swing' and 'boomerang'  and 'super slo-mo', but the only feature I can actually find is the slo-mo.  The other features are buried somewhere in the camera and Samsung provides ZERO instructions on how to use them.I'm currently scouring the internet to see how to activate these features, but it is a major fail for Samsung for not providing guidance in the box.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to get Samsung products because of their Google integration.  Now there is a button on the side that you cant turn off without signing up for Samsung's service.  I will no longer be purchasing Samsung products.UPDATE: There updates continue to try and push their products.  Even going so far as removing your settings and replacing them with samsung offerings.  Will never buy Samsung again.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love EVERYTHING about this phone, except for one thing. The BATTERY drains way faster than all my previous phones. I've used the iPhone X before to play Fortnite and the battery on the iPhone X didn't drain as fast as this phone does. It might be that Fortnite isn't optimized for android or something, I don't know. I've also played a lot of Asphalt 9 on this phone and the battery drains quickly too. I recommend getting this phone still, if you're not worried about the battery. This phone has a excellent camera, although the Google Pixel 2 XL excels in some areas. A nice feature about the camera is that you can change the aperture. The screen on this phone is the best! The screen is so beautiful and HQ! I took my iPhone 7 Plus out to compare and I just notice the ugly bezels on the iPhone screen. I don't think I can use phones with bezels again after using this amazing phone! The phone is very fast, of course with a Snapdragon 845, you can expect it to do anything. Runs Fortnite perfectly fine if you want this phone to play Fortnite. Multitasking is very easy. All in all it's a great phone, worth every single penny you've spent. If you don't care about the battery life, this is the perfect phone for you.

Now transfer the files to your PC and look at the captured frame rates. Right Click--> Properties--> Details--> Frame Rate. You will see that each video probably has a different recorded frame rate. If you really want to see the camera fail, take it out to a trail in the woods and film there. I guarantee you it won't record at 60fps, but instead something like 51fps! Hoping there's a software update for the camera soon.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Honestly this is one of the best smartphones I've used in a long time. Snappy, UI is good, screen is gorgeous, camera is great, pretty much everything to expect when purchasing a 800+ smartphone.The real complaint I have is the speakers sound when cranked to full as on EDM and some hip hop( these are the main genres I listen to) the bass levels drastically drop. A bit dissapointing but cranking it down a little bit and back to business as usual.Anyway its a great phone and I would definitely say it is a contender for one of the best phones of 2017-2018.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Back in March, I switched from an LG V20 to the S9+ because the screen on my LG began to bleed through. Big mistake. The Samsung pales in comparison to the LG. There's no tap or knock to wake option, the fingerprint sensor is finicky, scrolling through social media is a chore and I found myself growing more and more aggravated with daily use. In short, I paid the phone off early. When I was in the store explaining at how dissatisfied I was with the phone, a Samsung representative was present.  Upon overhearing my gripes, he just said something about not pleasing everyone. While that's true and there is no perfect phone, Samsung sure has some catching up to do with LG.  Much better User Interface on LG and the fingerprint sensor isn't as finicky.  Do yourself a favor and check out the V30 or the G7.  Skip the S9+

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Recently upgraded from the S7 to the S9+ and I'm terribly disappointed. Last week, I decided to upgrade from a Samsung S7 to a Samsung S9+. I even went all in with the BOGO deal from Verizon and upgraded Junior at the same time.Rarely have I been so disappointed in a tech purchase! And Samsung, I hope you have people watching for this sort of post. I'll be RETURNING. THIS. PHONE. tomorrow. Major shortcomings include ""Bixby,"" microphone placement, and voice recognition.First, the ""Bixby"" personal assistant is a train wreck. I don't know who decided that an unholy union of the Yahoo! home page and Google Assistant was a good idea, but they seriously missed the mark. And it CAN'T. BE. DISABLED. Nothing enrages me more than software bundles that can't be disabled.Second, you have to hold the phone in your hand to be able to talk on the speakerphone, or the microphone is muffled and useless. Seriously, Samsung?! the whole point of the speakerphone function is to be able to put the phone down.Thirdly--and this is the deal killer for me--the voice recognition for talk-to-text, voice dialing, and talk-to-email is just abysmal. These features worked nearly flawlessly on my S7, but on the S9+ I'm flying into daily rages over the garbled nonsense the phone ""hears"" when I talk to it. I have no accent and enunciate very clearly and it does no good. Even if I shout single words and go completely over the top on my enunciation, I can't send a single text message of the simplest imaginable words. I spend 50-60 hours per week driving and MUST be able to communicate hands free as much as technologically possible.Swing and a resounding miss, Samsung.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am completely perplexed that this thing has such bad notifications.I use LG, Pixel and Iphone, saw it all, and had reasons to abandon Samsung long time ago. Every cheap LG just worked better than Samsung for me.Decided to try S9  due it's small size; the only other option was Google Pixel but its display is just too bad. The only thing worse than the display are those large bezels, and the need to find and install some 3rd party apps that would allow to auto-hide the soft buttons, when you want to get more out of that abysmal display. Heck, except in Youtube, the buttons are always  there, making that 5"" screen more like 4.5"", in a body that's wider than S9. What a nonsense..Anyway, S9 notifications:No notifications on locked screen:  I have to take it, unlock, swipe down (needs both hands) and then I'll see notifications. Iphone/Pixel/nexus turns on the screen for a few seconds, I can see if it's anything interesting, if not I go with my work, the phone turns off the screen.Limited notifications on locked screen:Shows two lines vs full screen + scroll on iphone. Some settings available that don't help much. Androids in general are not that good as iphone, as they always are trying to bundle notifications. If you try to avoid that, at least they'll be bundled by the app.Raise to wakeup and show notifications:With iphone/Pixel/Nexus, I would pickup the phone and the accelerometar would wake up the phone, showing  notifications. As soon as I put the phone down the screen goes off. When I pickup S9 nothing happens - again unlock and swipe procedure...Notifications while using the phone:Some message comes in, the phone does NOTHING. Sometimes it vibrates, sometimes it sounds, and sometimes it does show the popup.All this regardless of Notification Sounds settings and Silent mode. WTF ?App Icon number:Not reliably cleared or set on Google Inbox, Outlook, Google Play, to name a few.Note: some of these problems are tied to Notification Sound being off. So, they tied together Sound and Visual part of the notification system. Maybe that's good, but it's them who tried to distinguish between Visual and Sound Notifications in  Settings. Naturally, these certainly are two different things as their use model is different.  Samsung knows that but they failed to get it right. It's understandable why they failed - read below about the SW update I got.  Anyway, sometimes some things work for a while (e.g. after I change different options) but then get broken again. Classical Samsung...All in all, I am relying on my Pebble to show me notifications.Some 3rd party apps allow coping with most of these problems but they are unreliable, sometimes power hungry or not persistent. So why Samsung doesn't care ?  Well, just two days into Preorder (I already got my phone) and I get Software Update with important bug fixes. So, these guys are trying to deliver the software with zillion options so naturally it's not yet ready and is full of bugs. They start lots of things, and  rarely nail a single one.First crazy option: Edge screen Notifications. You got to check out that hopeless attempt to implement ... ...i don't know what.Second crazy  option: Turn On screensaver when screen is off. it's screen **saver** for a turned off screen ? WTF ?Third crazy option: Always on screen showing me the clock (duh) and that I have notifications... Sure I DO! I receive about hundred or more different notifications daily. The phone is ALWAYS in front of my face when working and driving - show me the notification, not an icon saying there's one...Fourth crazy option: You can enable vibration when you pickup the phone, if there was some notification. Duh, what about SHOWING that notification.I was thinking working hard getting different 3rd party apps until I fix the notifications to suit my needs. But still, that would leave me with the curved screen;  Curved screen means there are no cases that allow comfortable grip as the case cannot extend fully above the LCD. I find much larger phones more comfortable in my hand - e.g. Samsung's own S8 Active, Pixel 2 XL with a proper case are easier to handle. So, my argument that I should get S9 because it's the smallest premium phone doesn't apply anymore.In addition, curved glass easily breaks as the glass is exposed. So many broken S8 phones around. I hear they've put much better **glass** into S9.  Duh..And not to forget the screen protector - THERE ARE NO GOOD glass screen protectors on the market (yet). I don't know what's wrong but glass protectors requires you to increase the screen sensitivity in the phone settings. Well, that option doesn't work good. I type fast and often use my phone for work email. I can't go and repeat every other letter. Also, glass screen protector, as of today, don't cover the full screen. In fact, they have some glue on the sides for the better grip, actually covering the whole curved edge.All in all, I am returning this one, and will wait to see what LG G7 will look like. Otherwise, will wait for Pixel 3. Until then, iphone 7, with all it's problems, is still a better deal for me than S9.Some notable positive sides:Samsung Internet browser is just awesome.LCD is excellent. Even better after Apple forcefully reduced the LCD brightness on iphone 7-,  to ""help"" aged batteries. Don't know about iphone X, should be also close to 700nits like this one.Starting camera with double click to Power button.Photos *with flash* in dim conditions are ages ahead of the iphone.Home button is there - just press glass a bit harder.Speakerphone is much louder than Iphone 7.---------------------------------------------------------UPDATE on screen wake-up on Notification:Googled a bit to see what can be done. Apparently, people mention that Samsung differs from IOS and stock Android in that you should depend on Edge light, LED light, vibration, sound, but not screen wake-up. So, Samsung tried to be more clever than Google or Apple. Lets see if they succeeded; I google a bit more and there are posts going back to 2015 about different issues:1. Some people actually  LIKE that there are no screen wakeup on Notifications. But their screen is WAKING UP ! S6, S7, S8, S9. People suggested lots of thing but nothing helped those poor souls.2. Some people are like me and would want notification - just can't get them.3. Some people argue why would somebody want to be in Group 2. Duh, what a bunch of schmucks - that should be a configurable option, to satisfy both groups, and no discussion needed.3. Some screenshots show a very promising option in the security settings  - ""Wake Up screen on Notifications"". Well, that seems like it, except that I don't have such option.4. There are reports on all kind of apps that will screw up the notifications. While Googling, a Verizon help page for S9 came up, showing that the screen will not turn on when... Outlook is installed. Aaaargh. I need that one for work. Anyway, after removing it and after doing the factory reset its still the same for me.I am reducing this to one star due to so many bugs. Started with Notifications, but I don't know what else is there...

5.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE: Well, I've had my S9 plus for almost 2 mths now & I see it more every day! It's so fast compared to my other phone! I'm really glad I took the plunge & ordered this phone.I was really nervous about ordering this phone after reading the reviews, but after receiving it, I'm so glad I ordered from Amazon. I didn't order from a third party seller. The phone came packaged in a huge box surrounded by air pockets plastic. Everything was sealed and looked brand new. Still, the first thing I did was contact Samsung to verify that this was a new phone with a valid 1 yr warranty. They assured me that it was indeed new and had a 1 year manufacturers warranty. When I tried signing up for prepaid service, the IMEI number only worked with Verizon. After chatting with the sales reps online, he assured me that wifi calling would work. I was doubtful after reading multiple reviews online, but figured I'd it didn't, I could go with T-Mobile next month. I called Samsung again after signing up with Verizon and the rep at Samsung said my phone was unlocked & would have worked with any carrier. Yesterday, when I got my Verizon Sim card & put it in, no wifi calling. I checked again in a couple minutes & boom! I had all kinds of features that weren't in my phone before including wifi calling and HD calling. So happy with this phone. It's lightening fast, the screen is brilliantly beautiful & the pics it takes are unmatched. Plus, no unnecessary apps that I had on my Galaxy S7 Edge from AT&T. Love this phone.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Samsung makes the best displays on the market, and I love almost everything about this phone... except the display.  The picture quality is excellent, but these curved edges and rounded display corners have got to go.Regarding the curved edges - they have no functional propose that couldn't be achieved with a flat screen.  No matter how you hold the phone you'll get glare at one edges or the other.  Images and text message the edge get distorted.  On-screen buttons at the edge are problematic at best.  The curved edges make it virtually impossible for a case to properly protect the phone if dropped.The rounded display corners are ridiculous.  In many apps it really makes no difference, but in some there's just content you can't see.  Ironically, the claimed display size of 5.8"" is measured as if the corners were not rounded.The fingerprint sensor placement is poor (though common).  If the phone is face up on a table I must pick it up to unlock it (or position my face directly above the screen for other biometrics).Everything else is great: performance, responsiveness, display quality, battery life - all the things you'd normally expect from a flagship device.  But these other bizarre design choices are baffling.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"My last phone Samsung Galaxy note 2 lasted more than 4 years and it is still working but some apps wont work on it so I had to upgrade to a new one.  New S9 is beautiful. Miss my pen but new pen one is ridiculously huge so I went for S9 without pen. Beautiful, smaller size, weight phone. I had extra money to spend, so I bought this one unlocked. Unlocked is the way to go, so when I am out of country(USA) I can buy another chip and put it on it. Plus there are no carrier specific spams on it. It is faster since my Note 2 was ageing and slowed down. Else there is not much they can put on it. Camera results are amazing. Music, I find no difference. I hope this is the last of the Smartphone, since they cannot find more to put on a smartphone that will hook falks on it.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted this phone a year ago! Finally got it! But was undecided after receiving it whether or not to keep it because of the newer S10 that was going to be released. I just love this lilac color! It is a well needed upgrade! My old phone had only 16 GB, I had to constantly delete the few apps installed just to get another one. With this S9 worries no more for it is 128 GB! I love the quick smooth response! I was able to update too!  I was also able to use a case I bought for it thats not available for the S10e yet. (They have all the cool cases on ebay.)  I knew of the S10 & plus but not of the S10e, oh well, my bad....After playing with the S9 I just couldn't send it back....I think this S9 is just as great so far. Good sound, picture, etc...Works for my needs thus far!

1.0 out of 5 stars,"We received the international model of this phone after purchasing two from Amazon, supposedly unlocked. I was on the phone 2+ hours between Amazon, Samsung, and Total Wireless (our service provider, uses Verizon network) figuring out why the phone wasn't working properly. The IEMI numbers were not clean. The phones could make calls but the 4g data was not working because they could not be fully registered. The Samsung rep said that the phones are an international version and the Total Wireless rep said they will not work on their network. Now I have to return these phones. What a waste of time. I'm so frustrated!

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I love Samsung phones but not this one. I upgraded from a galaxy 6 to the 9. It has so many issues that I just went back to my 6. Positive: transferring everything from my 6 to the 9 was easy peasy. This phone has an incredible battery life even when I play games on it several times a day. That's about the only thing I really like about the phone. The thing I noticed the very first day was the picture quality was blurry on all my photos that I took. That's the main thing I use the phone for. I tried several settings, but photo quality still remains to be an issue.For the first few weeks, my phone would actually show me notifications as to when I had emails, but then that just stopped. I checked every setting and even turned on the sound for the emails. Nothing. I did the 7 ""fixes"" suggested to fix this including downloading different launchers, and doing a reboot of the phone (several times). Nothing. I need to absolutely need to know when I have emails especially now that I'm taking classes again. Even if it did show a notification, if I opend the email app, it would delete the notfication. This wans't a problem to keep something in notification status on the 6. Fingerprint scanner doesn't work majority of the time. I just look like some idiot stroking my phone. creepy. haha. In addition to about 15 other issues listed about this phone, my app that unlocks my house when I arrive stopped working. Tried everything to fix that. nothing. I thought it was the app. But the minute I switched back to my 6, the app started working again. So, now I believe it's because of the 9. This has been the worse phone I have ever had. I would NOT recommend this phone to anyone!

1.0 out of 5 stars,"The phone does every great, EXCEPT the actual phone part is horrible.  I’m probably going to return it.  Calls drop every day.  It won’t dial out unless I restart it.  This happens whether the call is WiFi or via the carrier.  This did not happen with my last 6 phones.  Same carrier for last 6 phones, but this ""Flagship"" is a POS WITH A CAPITAL ""S"".  In addition, it does not hold its value.  It’s unbelievable to me that a OnePlus will sell on EBay for 95% of its purchase price every 6 months when the new version arrives.  But I bought this on Cyber Monday for $547 plus tax with a normal price of $899 and it’s selling on EBay in the 400s!  that’s ridiculous drop in value compared to OnePlus.  My biggest complaint is failure to dial out.  I’ve tried rebooting.  I’ve tried resetting everything.  I’ve called my carrier.  While the camera is exceptional, it FAILS at being a phone!!!!!!  UPDATE JAN 24, 2019 - I received a replacement.  The replacement had the same defects as the original, PLUS The volume from speakers was lower.  It is unworthy to be called a flagship.  It looks nice.  It has a nice screen.  It has a terrific camera.  It is a LOUSY phone - it’s main function.  It is Filled with Samsung Bloatware.  AND the predictive swipe texting on both phones was the worst at predicting words of any phone I’ve ever owned.  The keyboard sucks in swipe mode.  Horrible.  I’m going to OnePlus (no bloatware) or Apple (security and just great products).

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Before receiving my phone I received an email from reliant cellular (the seller) giving me instructions on how to resolve an issues should any arise. This made me feel good about the purchase because I got the info to quickly get help in the case I need any.The phone I ordered was as described, new, and perfect. I easily took the sim card out of my old phone (I used a pay as you go phone plan through simple mobile) inserted it and started using it. I will be switching plans because my carrier just doesn't cover enough areas that I tend to travel, but when I do switch, again I will be able to just swap out the sim and continue where I left off. I was initially concerned during start up that it wasn't unlocked due to a ton of mentions and programs for Verizon, but it is unlocked.My battery lasts me all day, unless my kids are watching endless videos. The screen and picture/ video quality is amazing! I'm so happy with this phone!! I'm still finding different things to play around with and personalizing my phone and I've had it for a week.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Before I start I need to say that I came from a Windows 10 phone and a flawless working mobile platform. However, after a long time using Windows phone it's clear that a Android phone is quite a shock, because everything is on your shoulders to get it customized/optimized. Regardless of this, my biggest contra is on battery life. This is unbelievable, max 12-14hr if you use WIFI, this is not top. My last Alcatel Idol 4s Windows phone last forever comparing to Samsung Galaxy S9+. The good thing is, you can customize and make it more ""Microsoft like"", Microsoft applications including Office, OneDrive, Cortana and Outlook do not come preinstalled, but when you can personalize the device with Microsoft's productivity applications so every customer is able to work, play and connect on their device when they leave. The design is nice, the camera pretty awesome, took some test photo's and they look great. To install everything and import stuff such as text and/or MMS messages take time (and additional tools). Without customization the default installation made the phone super ""wordi"", just sending from every app messages etc. So, I recommend to check this first to fulfill your needs. The screen is stunning, clear picture. And it's good to see, Samsung is catching up with former Microsoft Hello technology to have fingerprint, iris, face recognition. Thats a very good feature which is also used in additional apps such as banking. I'm also concerned about IP68 (water protection) because there is no rubber seal protecting the sim and micro sd card from water. Bottom line: battery life is for me the absolute negative point, therefore 3 stars

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was SO excited to get my new phone... I opened the Amazon box(in tact) to find a Samsung Galaxy S9 box. The outer sleeve of the box was dented and ripped. First I was disappointed because I did not order a used phone, I ordered a new phone and expected a new looking box. I then took the sleeve off and finished opening the box only to find that there was NO PHONE in the box at all, no phone, no charger, no nothing!!!!! I am so disappointed and furious I could scream. I spent a lot of money on the phone. I called Amazon and the woman told me there was nothing they could do. She told me that they needed to start a 3 day investigation. No reassurance, nothing. They told me to call them back in 3 days. I am guessing they have some internal theft going on?? Not sure what else it would be. I order from Amazon all the time. I rarely have an issue, but this makes me rethink ordering from Amazon, or online at all. Has anyone else had something like this happen???

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had many Samsung phones and liked them.  But my most recent phone was an LG V20, which I was also very happy with.  The camera glass cracked after 2 years, and I decided to get another Samsung.  Overall this is a great phone. I wish it was a little larger, so the same screen resolution yielded larger text and icons.  I know I can adjust it, but on the V20 everything's a bit larger at the same resolution, because the usable screen is larger. But if you have good vision at that distance it won't bother you.One complaint I have is Bixby and the Samsung bloatware.  I bought this unlocked so I wouldn't have the carrier bloatware, but Samsung puts on plenty of their own, and along with Bixby, you can't delete most of it, just disable it.  It continues to nag me to use one of the apps.  I don't know why they want to cram this down the user's throat.  I already bought the phone.  If I thought Samsung had better apps, I'd download them.  But none of their built in apps are better than Google stock apps or other 3rd party. I'm not sure what the reason is for trying to push their apps on users.  I guess to avoid this  you have to buy a Google phone.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have always been a Samsung smartphone loyalist, but that ends now. It's nearly impossible to change the  artery on the S9, therefore, I will need to buy an entirely new phone in the next year or two. But that's not why I'm giving this phone (and Samsung) one star. The microphone stopped working, so no one can hear me when I  call them. From what I have read, this is a major issue which Samsing has failed to address. I tried all fixes to no avail, to include restoring the phone to its factory settings. Very frustrating for an almost $800 phone, which is not a paperweight. Samsing needs to acknowledge and remedy this software glitch.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok, so all of the reviews mentioning verizon had me kinda worried. Don't be. I have verizon, received phone, installed nano sim from old phone and signed into google, and poof everything was there without all of the verizon bloatware. No contact with verizon at all for set up. Visual vm seemed to be an issue for a lot of reviewers, open the included Samsung vm app and push and hold '1.' Enter password the first time and then you have an app the looks and functions just like the verizon version.For a guy who grew up with the phone wired to the wall, I am still amazed at the technology advancements made. There are a lot of features on this phone, useful stuff to. Just the video and sound improvements alone are awesome as compared to droid t2.First week of use and still learning some features, but very pleased. Battery life is great, almost double my previous phone.I bought a combo with a chrome book, wireless car and home chargers and a case and came out $175 less than v wanted for just the phone and all of their bloatware.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Moved over from an iPhone 7 .If you can extract yourself from iOS (easier said than done), this is a great phone.Phone itself: excellent call quality. headphones are really nice and there is a headphone jack with no dongle and you don't HAVE to use bluetooth. charges so quickly.Camera: Fantastic in every way.Muzak: Am still a little confused on the various Samsung apps, esp Samsung Music which is so weird. Listening to music/ videos is really nice on this because of the full screen and the front facing speakers.Size: This is a great size ... perfect for me. I am a medium build person with medium sized hands. I did not want a phablet. This phone feels like something between an iPhone 7 and 7+ for comparison. Don't know how it actually compares but feels smaller than the iPhone +.Get a case on this thing. I am using the SUPCASE Unicorn Beetle ... it's thin and grippy.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband bought me this phone in the lilac purple color for my birthday,...it's gorgeous! I love the display and the infinity edge. For me this is a total upgrade from the S5 I've been using, I'm so glad I waited! Everything shows up bright and crystal clear. Even my email looks nicer!The emojis you make using the camera do turn out a bit creepy,...they look like you but not really. At my age I don't think this is something I see myself using too often in chat or messenger. It's fun for all of maybe 10 minutes.The camera is nice, the pictures come out clean and clear. However I do wish all the features were explained a bit more in the manual  to make it easier to figure out. It's nice being able to scroll through the different modes with a swipe of your finger but the how-to's on using some of the different options would be nice if they were printed out in the manual for reference. I'm sure it would be easy enough to look on YouTube or Google,....Haha I suppose this is what happens when you go from an old phone and leap frog over a few generations and find yourself in the future. :pI'm not too crazy about Bixby though, there should be a way to reassign the button to something else and remove the app entirely if you choose. I also like my camera settings set so you say ""Smile"", ""Shoot,"" ""Cheese"", ""Record video"", or another trigger word,... but unless you completely turn off the voice for Bixby  you can't use the voice command on the camera. One feature should not cancel out another,... maybe there will be a software update later on.  Or maybe I have completely missed the setting somewhere and will bump into it somewhere after I've used it more?The speakers are excellent, music sounds great and phone calls come through very clear. Using speaker phone I actually had to turn call volume down, on my old phone it was hard to hear people talk and the mic didn't pick up very well either. Not the case here!I love this phone!  It's a nice size, easy to hold, and looks great! It was also very easy to set up and after I played with it for awhile I found it simple to navigate with a few cool surprises thrown in for me to discover. Having read how similar this phone is to the S8 I can understand some people being annoyed at spending all their money and not really getting much more than they already had, but I did read before these were released  that they were similar and if I had an S8 I probably would not have bought this model. For the most part I still feel this is a great phone. I know for a fact I will have a great time taking pictures and videos of my kids and grandkids with it!*3/21/18-  Added a few sample pictures,  one is a  close up (approx.12"" away, begging dog wanted my lunch), another a couple inches away, and the others from about 15 feet. No filters just had the camera set to auto and let it do its thing. Pictures come out clear and so much nicer than from my other phone. I've been playing with the other features as well and results are great too.Using the volume button to snap a quick picture is convenient, it makes taking pictures with this size phone so much easier. I'll have a great time using this camera when the grand kids visit!The lock screen is a little annoying when you have to click the power button then do the swipe screen, but in a way it's useful, my old phone did all sorts of things on its own while tumbling around  in my bag. The hidden home button and the power button are both quick and responsive, either one quickly wakes the phone up but the home button brings up the home screen if you press it when the screen is off. You can always change the time out settings so your screen doesn't click off as fast to give you more time, so not really a big deal for me.This is a fun phone to have. Battery life for me is great, I keep the display on bright because it's just so pretty. I also have the time  out screen set for 5 minutes. I just charge my phone once a day and I'm good to go! No regrets with this phone.

It was a child's play toy. Calling Amazon  was a bit interesting because they had me on hold for about 40 minutes. Buyer beaware you may pay $700 for a fake.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"They had a chance to fix all the laggy, unusable “features”. Another forced Bixby (it insists upon itself). I have both this and the iPhone X. Surprise, guess which one just works out of the box (SPOILER ALERT: iPhone). I was so excited about this phone, but it has maybe a (marginally) better camera setup than the S8+. It’s at least as laggy as the last phone. It’s not worth the price, flagship or not. If you’re OS agnostic, get an iPhone. This is way more trouble than it’s worth. It arrives bloated and you can do nothing about it.Also, in typical Android fashion, you get a less and less responsive device as time goes on. Every app you install makes the phone that much slower. This is an Android problem, same thing happens on the Pixel 2 XL. I should have stuck with the Pixel which is uglier, but not full of bloat.It has a nice screen though, but I like the iPhone’s screen as much. This is hardly an upgrade, but another disappointment from Samsung. Maybe it’ll catch fire like the Note and I’ll be able to be rid of this phone.

I would take it over IOS any day if it wasn't for the battery Life. You would have more luck using a sidekick from 2005 plugged into a potato to hold a better charge than this phone. The note 7 (which I also owned) blew up and this one just dies after 30 minutes of use. If you can charge it for three hours to use the camera it a great.. other than that you get a ""battery too low to use flash"" message.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Buyer beware. Unlocked phones do not support some carrier features like video calling and wifi calling. I bought this s9 plus to use on Verizon wireless and these features are blocked. The reason they are blocked is because it's an unlocked phone and Verizon wants you to spend the big bucks buying the phone from them to use all the features the phone supports. It BS really but that's just how it is. So if you buy this or any unlocked phone then you can expect some of the features not to work. I warned you.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was highly disappointed when I received a locked device rather than ""unlocked"" as advertised. I was however very pleased with the speed in which I received my replacement, which was the very next day. I contacted amazon and the replacement was sent without even having to return locked device first, something that surprised me.There was no damage to the box or any missing pieces, the device came brand new as expected (even the locked device was in excellent condition). It's been roughly 2-3 weeks since I've been utilizing my device, and I'm very pleased with my purchase. I have had no issues so far *knock on wood*, and it was an easy switch moving from the Samsung S6 to the S9.So despite the initial hiccup with the phone being locked, the speed in which it was rectified definitely made up for the initial mix up. So overall I'm happy with my purchase.

I am sure it can be had for about that price (if not less once the S10 comes out).Enjoy the phone!

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Received the product on time, however there were no accessories, on further inspection the phone was fake. All accessories were in Chinese, it felt like only a weight was inside the device . The back of the device only had stickers for the camera, led and fingerprint reader. Just casually looking on the device you won't be able to tell, but once you actually touch it you can feel it. Going through the reviews it seems this happens a lot with the Lilac version.Amazon Customer service was extremely understanding and helpful and quickly processed my oder and I was able to get the black version which I am happy with now.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Update April 9: I’ve ordered the Samsung Galaxy S9 phone twice (two separate occasions) and when I tried to register them at Samsung, I found out that the phones were intended for the Hong Kong market and that Samsung US would not warranty the phones.  Warranty would only be honored if the phone was sent to Hong Kong. Additionally, these phones have specific Hong Kong parts so getting a repair in the US may be difficult because parts may not be available. I’ve returned both to amazon with no issues.  In talking with amazon customer service, I was told they were going to pull the inventory and figure out where things went wrong. Btw, the only was to find out if the phone is a US marketed phone is to call Samsung. You cannot tell by model number and only Samsung can tell by the IMEI number.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"The phone arrived in an open box so I assumed it had been used before. I noticed off the bat that the Bixby button was stuck so I tried manipulating it with a small tool but it wouldn't work. After initial setup, I figured I would try the phone for a few says and it seemed ok. But, I noticed it was NOT holding a charge. I reread the description of the phone and realized it was refurbished. So I packed it back up and sent it back. Waiting for refund now.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Received my new phone last week. Lots of options & lots to learn. My phone, according to my carrier, is a dual sim. I did put an SD card in the other slot.  My model number is SM-G9650. The phone was unlocked and new in box, as described. Took a bit for the carrier personnel  to determine which sim card to use and they were a great help in activating the phone. Transfer of information from old phone to new one was very easy using smart switch. The first thing I had to do was switch language from Spanish to English. Apparently, since this is an unlocked phone, I am unable to set up voice mail. I learned this from you tube, but will double-check with carrier. Not sure yet about Bixby.11/1/2018:  I visited my carrier and personnel was able to install my voice mail. Had to set it up ""the old way."" Anyway, it's now working and I'm liking my phone so much better!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I switched from the LG v30 to this model because I wanted something smaller. It is More comfortable, lighter.Picture quality is way better from both cameras hands down. The phone picks fingerprints Easily but not bad. Screen is brighter and it gets dimmer.Samsung pay is a plus.  Android pie update available.  Looks like Samsung is faster than lg when it comes to updates.Phone lags a but when closing applications  on the new android pie with the new one ui. The fingerprint sensor is really fast and the sound is better when using the phone speakers more immersive since the v30 only has a bottom speakerBattery I haven't test long enough.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this phone brand new from amazon... it was very clearly used.  The phone had been set to spanish (us) and already had a folder labeled ""Applicacions de Microsoft"" on it and the message app spelling dictionary only had the option for spanish (us).  Cant trust anyone these days.  On the bright side they included a phone case for free lol! Thanks who ever sent me this phone I appreciate that.It is a SM-G9650 (Snapdragon 845) cpu but because of that its region is set for china ... not the USA.  So mine didn't come with the ability to do some stuff (wifi calling for example) that you would expect from a new phone.The phone itself is awesome.  I have large hands and its just a little too big to use with one hand for me which is its only drawback.  Most normal people would use it with 2 hands but I have to be different.The picture quality is great even when capturing action shots (tried to sneak a pic of my girlfriend but she moved and I made an ugly face for half a second... the picture is so clear its like we planned for her to do that face for the picture).It works with the Samsung Qi Certified Fast Charge Wireless Charging Convertible Stand/Pad and does fast charge on it.Coming from an iPhone 4 this thing is night and day difference but I bet you could say that about any new phone.When I  open apps they open immediately.  Browsing the web and watching youtube videos is smooth and uninterrupted... On my old iPhone the youtube app would lock up after an hour or so of use.  Plus I can download apps again LOL!  My old phone was so old it wouldnt get ios updates and its level of ios isnt supported by ANYTHING so I couldnt even get my email with it anymore!I did discover one thing that I don't like about it over the iPhone.... You cant turn off apps from being able to use mobile data in the foreground (you can turn off background usage).  So if you are on data and you open up youtube or 9gag and start using it its using your data.  On an iPhone if you go into your cellular data section of your settings and turn an app off it will not be allowed to ever use any mobile data unless you go back in and turn that back on.  REALLY saves you from using data when you have a wifi connection available but not connected for whatever reason and you start browsing the web.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"If you don't mind losing features from your carrier get an unlocked phone. This phone is not programmed with any carriers software. I have lost 5 or 6 options I need with ATT. ATT tells me there is nothing I can do and they cannot flash or install their software. My only option is to buy a new phone, unlocked directly from ATT. This phone is a waste of money and had I known all this prior to buying it, I would not have bought it.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just upgraded due to a stellar cyber Monday sale. The phone was just $519 with a free Amazon show included. What an upgrade from the S5. I love my old phone. It still works just like it did from day one. BUT  This.....Samsung S9 is by far a better phone than any iPhone out there. The screen is bigger crystal clear display. Lots of cool new features in emojis and apps that my s5 didn't have access to. Battery life is phenomenal! The sound is better then any phone I have used. The curved edges give the screen the largest view. The camera seems very good. Still learning some of the new features.  I have no idea about some of these reviews, Mine came in a sealed box brand, I called Samsung they thanked me for being a loyal customer and said it comes with a two year warranty. I did buy a case and a screen protector. Thank you amazon for the great deal! (Will work with T Mobile, Boost, Red Pocket and ATT. ) As a precaution call your provider before you order :)  Heads up This will not work with SPRINT they do not accept any unlocked androids. Kind of a hassle, so I switched providers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I received the phone and when i opened I realised the package has been previously opened and resealed.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the Samsung Galaxy S9 Like New from Amazon Warehouse Deals and NOT an authorized seller. I wanted an extra $50 off cause someone touched the phone but then returned it. I work in education; I'll take any deal I can get. I also made sure the phone came with original packaging (It was stated in the condition description).So far, I am very pleased with this purchase. The phone is lovely. It came with the plastic still on and all the original pieces such as headphones and the little tools for popping out the sim card. It does not come with a charger so I picked some up in a separate order.I have AT&T. Getting my service sorted was a bit tricky but it is set up and everything is working now. I went to one store and the agent switched the sim card and checked calling service but not my data. I left, I shopped, and then suddenly realized that my internet wasn't working. Went to another store but the agents were useless and only wanted to sell me stuff that was irrelevant to my issue. So it goes. I went home and called AT&T. Three agents and an hour later I rolled a yahtzee and Mark the Advanced Tech guru came on the phone. We did a bunch of stuff on the phone having to do with my IMEI and APN. Neither immediately worked. Finally, he had me hang up and turn my phone off so he could ""zap it."" He called me back after, cause that's the kind of class act Mark is. Huzzah! My mobile data was working without issue.One disadvantage of buying the phone Like New is that the warranty was started by the person who first bought it. It does not say anywhere in the Amazon description when the phone was first purchased. I registered the phone with my Samsung account and it shows that the warranty started in June. I am therefore assuming that's when the first owner registered it. It is beginning of Dec. now. If I anticipated really using the warranty (I don't) I might find this annoying.I'll also point out that I bought this phone with my Discover during an Amazon cashback quarter. The 5% cashback covered my state tax. This saved me an extra $30 that I put toward a microsd card for more storage.If anything goes wrong with this phone, I will update in the future. So far, I am tickled lilac with my Like New Amazon Warehouse Deals phone.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Too expensive to have such a short life. This S9 was my 2nd expensive phone purchased in Amazon. First I bought S7 refurbished. Horrible idea! Had a short life of maybe 7 months. Second time I purchased this S9 less than a year ago, priced around $800.00USD - Phone was good, but it started to get slow to reinitiate plus last time it was updating over night, it simply never came back to life. Too expensive for such a short life. Will not buy any more cell phones in Amazon. I went straight back to Best Buys to get some insurance, warranty and anything possible.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have not had many issues with this phone thus far. I always keep it in battery saver mode which can be frustrating for lack of certain notifications, but it seems to be fast, the size isn't too big for me, although one handed operation is limited compared to the smaller phone. Charge lasts all day without much use without power saver mode. Add a fair amount of use and power saver mode and still lasts all day.I couldn't justify getting a GS9 over a GS9+ because the battery life is better, 2 cameras, and an extra 2 GB of ram over the other device. I like this one for these extra features. Samsung made a quality phone, and I am happy to own it. I'd recommend charging the battery up to 85%, and keeping it above 35%, which may double your battery life (maintian 95% capacity after 4 years instead of samsung's 2 year guarantee)

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this phone during a Cyber Monday Sale. Considering the reduced cost and the extra Amazon device included with the package this was a fantastic deal! Buying from Amazon also gave me a peace of mind. Should something go wrong then I have a path of recourse.The phone was new, factory sealed, and unlocked. It fired up right away. Getting it work with Mint Mobile was a little challenging but that's not the phone's fault. The camera is excellent, especially if you shoot in RAW/DNG format and process the image with something like Capture One or Lightroom. Battery life is also great but I also don't use the phone 24/7 non-stop.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Puchased this phone on pre-order back in March and have been using it since the day I received it on Sprint. I was hesitant to purchase a phone outside of a Sprint store but it worked out well and there was only one hiccup in activating it. This phone does not come with a SIM, which apparently Sprint doesn't always carry in the store. After some searching a SIM was located and the associate switched my phones (S8 to S9) in about 10 minutes.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"It was waiting for me when I got home, and it's perfect. Everything is in the box as it should be, all wrapped in cling plastic and brand new. I've only had the phone for a few hours now so I can't make any claims about how well it works, but it's definitely new. Some of the reviews had made me nervous but it isn't scratched, used, or missing all together. It even has the SmartSwitch paperwork, user guide, health warnings, and extra ear bud caps (still sealed). My only complaint isn't with the phone, but with the delivery person. They left it in my back yard for some reason, so my dog chewed into the cardboard Amazon box and put some deep gouges in the external S9 sleeve. But nothing important was damaged.

No original box or manual or anything else aside from the phone and original charger as described by seller. Popped in my SIM after cutting it down to size.  All my contacts were there.  All texts gone. Had problem sending multimedia text message but looked online to solve problem (APN related).  I haven’t explored everything on phone yet.  So far no major problems yet, knock on wood.I’m glad I took a chance to update my old phone and buying from good seller.  Paid 1/2 the price, new, win-win.

Waiting for the new User interface and new Android. They should be available very soon. I did a lot of research on this phone before buying. I'm not disappointed. I like Bixby which I didn't think I would use but it's handy. Push the Bixby button and ask for help or open apps, messaging, phone, voice mail. Whatever you want to use and it opens. Call phone number, call voicemail, create and send this message. Very quick and helpful.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have only bought Samsung phones before and this one disappointed me. First off, for some reason the screen scratches very easily. My keys were able to put some significant grooves in the screen. The battery life is worse than last year's S8 and I basically have to keep it on battery saving mode all the time. I have had the phone for almost three months now and it seems to be slowing down. It also glitches alot and some apps refuse to open. Overall, for a Samsung, not very impressed.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"****UPDATE 1/14/19****My original review for the phone is below. I have owned this for 1 month and found my phone would not update to the latest firmware, it kept saying it was up to date from July 2018 even though Samsungs website showed monthly updates. I contacted Samsung, provided the IMEI number for the phone and found it was factory locked to a specific carrier (not mine and NOT the one seller said it was unlocked for.) I contacted that carrier and found it was unpaid by the owner and would be locked until that person paid it off, the IMEI was held against the original owners social security number due to the unpaid balance and they told me to return the phone, the seller was committing a form of fraud by selling me that phone. I would ALWAYS suggest contacting Samsung with the IMEI number to verify it IS fully unlocked before putting all of your info into the new phone.***Original review****There are only 2-3 downfalls I have found with this phone and one related to the seller, I bought a refurbished phone and it still had the old phone number registered to it which is a fault on the seller, but also a caution to anyone buying refurbished.The other ""downfalls"" are related to the curved edge screen. It is impossible to find a case that protects the screen on all sides due to this. I have found multiple cases that are raised on the top and bottom keeping the screen off tabletops when face down however the sides are still exposed. The other is I can see a slight flicker on the sides if I turn the phone slightly, this may or may not be with every phone or just mine since it was refurbished.Now onto the good!The speaker quality feels like the phone is it's own handheld movie theater. The color is extraordinary. Battery life has been better than my previous s7 but not as good as I was expecting for a model 2 years newer and the plus version. Response time is impeccable. There is bass with the sound. No lagging whatsoever. Highly recommend the phone just note the curved edges are exposed and that part makes me nervous.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, the a##hold carrier that delivered it left it on the front porch in the freaking snow and ice- so I was not happy about that at all.  I am frankly sick to death of the delivery people Amazon uses, and their delivery promises that aren't kept.  Delivery was promised Sunday but I didn't get it until today.  I watched up until 8:00 last night when I got an email stating that it would be delivered TODAY by 8 p.m. instead of yesterday by 8 p.m.The phone appears to be new, but I have no idea how to tell.  It looks new, is spotless and my daughter loves it (so far).  I will update my evaluation as time goes on.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is so much better than my Note 4, not that I didn't like the 4. The one thing I didn't notice until actually getting the S9+ is that the security control by Knox is within the S9+. I think I read this is a preferred requirement by businesses now for their enterprise cell phones for employees. Could be a very good thing for all of us. It does require me to play with it more to find out how I need to ""tailor"" it to settings I prefer so it is easier for me personally. But hey, I love discovering new things anyway. The screen is beautiful for my Midnight Black version of my S9+, the responsiveness is fantastic and memory space is oh so much better. And buying it unlocked? I find that to be the one thing I didn't expect to be outstanding. I hope and plan this to last me a long long time.
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a Galaxy S7 that I love.  Despite being big, it feels nice in my hand and is easy to use.  The S9 with its curved edges was infuriating to use.  My palm kept hitting the side of the screen when I reached across the phone.And I really don't get the point of the curved edge.  It doesn't do anything useful I care about, it just makes it hard to use.  I think Samsung decided they had to do something interesting and different to give it a ""wow"" factor, despite it being worse than useless.So my brother says you can get a big case to cover up the edges to solve the problem.  Ok, but if the solution is to just cover the edges up, what's the point of having it in the first place???And it's super tall.  Which I also don't understand.  It makes it hard for my thumb to reach the top of the phone.I feel like Samsung has fallen into the trap where their shareholders just want the stock to keep going up, so it's not enough to sell a million phones, they have to sell 2 million next quarter, so instead of making a good useful phone they are going to make a gimmicky phone to try to attract people with new gimmicks even if they're not useful.I returned the S9 after a day of use and I'm back to my S7.  I'll probably get a Pixel 3 instead eventually.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I liked my Samsung GS7 Edge, but I *love* this phone!  The Oreo Android 8 update on the GS7e is pretty poky, but this phone screams!  Two apps I like but could barely use on the Samsung were the Microsoft ""Arrow"" launcher and the Google ""CarPlay Autos"" apps - Painfully slow on GS7e, but on GS9+ they scream!  Battery life continues to be excellent, better screen, better USB jack, better stereo sound, and also much better BlueTooth (I had some devices that were really slow to properly connect on GS7e's BT4.0, but GS9+'s BT5.0 rocks so far).  I wish Samsung and Google were a little less heavy-handed on insistently pushing their more privacy-invasive features (like location history, etc), and I wish I could uninstall a few GB of Samsung cr@pware though...

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Had to get a new phone, and really dislike the other options. The major drawbacks for this phone are the edge display, which is impossible to find a good screen protector for, and the fact that after recently cracking the display, I realized it costs roughly half the price of the phone to replace.  Other than the price of the display and the obnoxious, and seemingly pointless beveled ""edge"", I absolutely love the camera, and the phone is very fast.  The Sprint network obviously does the phone zero justice, so you may want to change service providers to benefit the the performance that this phone has to offer.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Note that this review is of how the product arrived and first day thoughts, it's not in-depth of the phone long-term.Contrary to what a few other customers seemed to have experienced in some reviews, my phone came completely brand new and not tampered with at all. Everything worked fine from launch and all I had to do was transfer my SIM and SD cards over (I use Verizon, the SIM works just fine, no need to contact them.) There's nothing I can see regarding damage or issues with the phone related to how it was sent or what could have happened beforehand.I bought this phone unlocked and new in order to avoid the Verizon bloatware I never used but couldn't manage to get rid of. It was also nice to avoid the hidden fees attached to new phones bought through providers.My initial thoughts are: it's fantastic.The picture quality is stunning, especially coming from a Droid Turbo II (which was a nice phone for what it was, but the screen is so lackluster in comparison.) The camera is beautiful and I could easily say justifies the pricepoint for those looking at the market for photography in comparison to other phones I've seen and I haven't even touched many of the features.The speakers are surprisingly clear and sound great. I've noticed a trend with many smartphones from day one to just have... awful speakers for some reason. Maybe manufacturers assume you're using peripherals and Bluetooth at all times. Regardless, this phone covers that base better than most others.The slim and tall design feels much better in my hand than I was expecting it to, coming from a smaller phone.I love the shortcuts on this Android version and just how the entire Galaxy line operates in general. Samsung has always made stellar leaps in convenience mixed with modernization and the S9+ is no different.As far as Bixby goes: I don't use voice commands on phones, whether it be Bixby, Google Assistant, etc., period. I just avoid the Bixby button (my one caveat with this phone is part of the hardware being designed exclusively for Bixby) so it doesn't apply.I will update this later regarding other things like battery life, communication features, and anything else I can think of after using it for an extended period of time.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I saved a $100 by ordering this from Amazon as opposed to getting it through AT&T. It connected to my AT&T carrier the moment we put the SIM card in. The phone is beautiful. I have not had time to thoroughly explore it, but it appears to be working just fine.My phone was sitting on the table this morning and it just went dead. I called Samsung Support and they emailed me a next day air shipping label. They were very good about it and I have no complaints.I do not look forward to being without my phone for a week.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this phone about 5 weeks ago. I needed something that was unlocked and that would work with AT&T as my Samsung Galaxy Note 4 finally died. The phone has worked perfectly since it arrived. It came new in box with a power cord, wall adapter, and headphones. I did have to take it in to a store to get a new Micro SIM card as the one in my previous phone was the larger type and did not fit in the slot. The battery life is great and the cell signal comes in with no issues.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"A phone with a beautiful glass body with many great qualities. Such as the use of Dolby atmos for an exquisite audio experience and custom audio settings. The infinity amoled display looks immensely beautiful with vivid colors and deep black. Another plus that samsung continued the use of the headphones slot. Battery life is great for everyday normal use, and 5he battery saver settings provide options that greatly extend the battery life of the device. Samsung pay is a very nice feature especially since it can work in more places than other digital payment methods.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had no trouble transferring apps from my old S4, though I did have to re-enter some passwords.  The cable connection didn't seem to work, but then it found the old phone on wifi and grabbed everything anyway.  The screen is completely eye-popping, especially after setting it to the highest resolution.  Blazingly fast compared to the S4 and the battery seems to last and last.  One real annoyance (but still giving it 5 stars): it's really hard to turn off the Bixby ""feature"" and it's tied to a dedicated button right under the volume control.  The button can't be used for anything else and is really easy to hit by accident.  C'mon Samsung.  The people that don't want it, don't want it.  It should be a simple setting to turn it off and assign the button to something else or nothing.  Magnificent device overall though.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded to this Samsung S9 Model SM-G960U1 unlocked version from a Samsung S7.  The phone works just fine and the transfer of all my stuff from the old phone to the new went pretty well.  While the curved screen has a visual appeal I believe that a flat screen would be both more practical and easier to protect.  In terms of it being a tool, I haven't discovered anything new that this phone can do that the S7 couldn't do.  It comes with something called ""Bixby"" that I guess we're supposed to all just know what it is and what to do with it... guess I'm not interested in Bixby until I see some information that educates me on what it does and why I might need it... I do like Samsung phones and once you've grown accustomed to a company's android interface it makes sense to stay with what is familiar.  If you have an S7 or S8 there is probably no reason to upgrade to the S9 version unless you have money burning a hole in your pocket.  In my case, one of my son's needed a phone so he got my old S7 and I treated myself to a new phone.
