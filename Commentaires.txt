so far, so good.  it is very hard to tell that this phone is a refurbished phone and not new.  i received it last thursday and have been busy installing updates, apps and accounts in order to switch over from my existing windows phone.  i have not activated on my verizon network but i have verified, by swapping my old phone's sim card into the s7, that it could connect to the verizon network in cdma lte mode.  once i've configured it i'll need to go to a verizon store, get a new sim, and activate it.  other than that this refurbished phone seems like it will work just as expected with a new phone.  i will update this review once the activation is complete and i've been able to put it to actual day-to-day use.
i believe this is going to be my best phone yet. it came in the time promised and it looks to be brand new. setting it up and transferring my data was a breeze. i love the ""always on"" screen that shows the time and date as well as certain other information. really a handsome phone that is the right size for me.the only reason i have not given it 5 stars is that i don't have my sim card yet, so i can't actually use it as a phone, just wi-fi. but i will have that installed soon and i imagine it will be wonderful.
product works as a phone. headphone jack does not. i don't have time to return it because i actively need a cell phone for business. i'd appreciate changing wording from ""refurbished"" to ""used"" or ""broken"". just so consumers are clear on what's up. ""like new"" should be pretty clear and apply to things that are, yknow, like new. thanks.
really nice phone for the price! everything on it is perfect, except when i try to play music through the aux cord in my car, it has a loud, annoying static sound that won't go away. i can bypass this though a bluetooth adapter, though, so it's not a huge issue, and it's the only issue i've had thus far. everything else works amazing and it looks like new. another minor issue was shipping. i ordered this phone last thursday and paid extra for one day shipping, but the phone arrived the following wednesday. the phone is nice enough that it wasn't a huge issue, but definitely don't pay extra for one day shipping or expect this phone to arrive in a hurry.
the battery life on this is terrible, it last about 2 hours. the operating system is about as slow as christmas and apps quit on me faster then battery does. will probably return, not worth the hassle. not to mention risking what feels like first degree burns from the thing overheating in my hand.pros:-cute ability to let google rule over everything-android-can cook eggs and the waterproof-ness prevents that yoke from entering the phonecons:-low security-heats up to the point where i thawed out two cavemen to show them this marvel of technology, they said it was dumb and used it to make fire-slow-battery dies faster then my last relationship(star if you read this i miss you you)
whoever this phone belonged to before me (the seller) knew that this phone had an issue, that is why it was sold for such a cheap price. yes it was a refurbished phone, but still with an ongoing issue. this phone requires a system update all day everyday, but once it is done, nothing reflects that update and then it asks for another update. it is a never ending request! i have to keep allowing the phone to update and reboot and i do not have another phone that i can use to send this one back. i can make and receive calls, text, etc. for the most part, but the last phone that i had was a decent phone, it just did not have enough storage space and a terrible camera, but it did not require updates every morning or every night! i need storage space and a great camera with great pictures. i am disappointed and i have never done a bad review about anything that i received through amazon! (i do understand that each seller is different, but this could cause issues in the future)
item was defective, screen broken, huge pink lines flickering before 90 day warranty was up, contacted company 1 day after 90 day warranty period which apparently starts when it was ordered, not received and would not help me out at all.i had not had the phone active for more than 60 days when this happened.
so glad i decided to purchase amazon certified refurbished.the phone i received was like new and fully functional. no problems activating it to my verizon account. battery life lasts all day with medium use. came with a samsung quick charger. i couldn't be happier with the performance and quality of this phone.
i would not consider this a certified refurb. it came with generic charger that wasn't useable so i'm using a galaxy s charger i had from another product. phone charges to 100% but does not stay charged more than 12 hours even with very limited use, notifications and smart background off. wish i had spend the extra on something more certain. any certified refurbished electronic item ive purchased previously always came with a name brand charger and good battery life therefore i am disappointed.
i am mostly please with the purchase. the phone looks great cosmetically and works great. only problem is with the battery. the battery is not good and i would have rated this only 3 stars. i get about 6 hours of light use before phone's completely dead, 2 hr's to 3 hr's max if i'm talking on it and have the blue tooth earpiece connected . we have another s7 we purchased new about 18 months ago, and when configured identically and placed side by side with the one we purchased from kiss electronics we can see an obvious difference on remaining battery power within 10-15 minutes. however, i called amazon customer service and explained the problem. they quickly offered to credit me $20 so i could purchase a new replacement battery, which i have ordered and will swap out with the bad one soon. so, i've raised my rating to 4 stars because of the incredibly responsive customer service response and my belief that a new battery will resolve my only problem with the phone. lastly, the s7 battery replacement process looks to be a little more than just a quick swap out. it involves special tools, heat gun, etc (i suggest watching a youtube video before attempting this battery swap). i will update this review after i replace the battery.
when we got the phone, the previous owner's information was still on the phone. that was bad enough, but now, after just 4 months, the phone has crashed and is completely dead. even though the phone appears completely fine, hasn't been dropped, and hasn't been wet, verizon employees said it was done. unless this seller follows up and something changes, our recommendation is to avoid them.

beware-phone aesthetically looks great.-charge port is loose.-unable to get rid of software update notification (run update and it still keeps coming back up every time.  tried factory reset and didn't fix problem.-battery life is very bad.  complete discharge within normal conditions (very little usage) from 100% at 6am to 45% at 10am to 0% by 2:30pm.  not possible to replace battery since it is a integrated battery / device.-called customer service and they will issue a refund or replacement but i have to go without a phone until new one arrives after they received this defective one.-i have to go to verizon to get a micro sim (had to cut old one to fit gs7 nano sim slot) for my old device just to send this one back, or go without a phone.unfortunate experience overall.
i was skeptical ordering. was assured it would work on verizon. has verizon logo on back. hardest part was getting a sim card cause it is an older phone and i had to drive over an hour to a verizon corporate store on a busy weekend.  husband loves it. it’s his first smart phone.  no complaints so far. questions were answered quickly. fast shipping.def recommend this seller and this product.
this cell phone was available from a number of different sellers, with mixed reviews across the board, and almost the same pricing.  i opted to go with dealfisher and  was very pleased with the entire order process.  see a ""seller review"" separately.  as far as the phone goes, i was a little bit hesitant at going with a refurbished unit, but it was almost $250 cheaper than purchasing new from verizon.  i'm glad i took the chance.  the phone is to any non-technical examination brand new.  not a scratch, rub mark or any other discernible indication that it has ever been used before.  it did not come with a sim card, or memory card, but that was clearly indicated in the product description.  what i did not know was that the galaxy s5, that i was replacing, has a ""micro sim card"" and the galaxy s7 (the new phone) has a ""nano sim card"".  they are not the same.  that's the bad news.  the good news is that my local verizon store (not and authorized vendor, but a ""real"" verizon store), installed a new nano card in a couple of minutes and then, since they weren't busy, cross loaded all of the contents from the old phone to the new...at no cost!  it can't get better than that.  by the way, the memory card is the same for both phones.  hope you get the same great results i did.  cheers...ed b.
phone looks and acts like it's in absolute brand new condition. my phone came with they legitimate samsung fast charger, usb converter too store information, and a set of really nice samsung earbuds. the only thing that doesn't scream this is brand new phone is that it came in a plain white box and cost $250 less than new!
the phone is missing the verizon voicemail app.  and spoiler alert you can't add it.  according to verizon support it is something that has to be added when the phone is first configured.  also per verizon they say this means its not really a verizon phone, its just a phone that will work on the verizon network.  ultimately what this all means is you can't tell if you have a voicemail, how many voicemails you have, who they are from or when they were left.  you have to dial the voicemail number and then listen to each message in its entirety and then check the info on the voicemail to get any info about it.  for someone who lives their life by their phone this is a no go.  if this would have been disclosed in the product description i would have picked another phone.
certified samsung refurbished phone had many problems out of the box. after-market accessories, charged very hot, screen had a light 1/3 section that jiggled, black colors were green, speaker cut in and out, mobile reception strength started out half of previous phone and decreased to near zero.  i would rate this refurbish very poor quality. i give this less than a star.
not truly unlocked. went to several carriers and none have been able to activate the phone. sending back.

1st, verizon tech tried 2 new sim cards would not work. put sim card in from my iphone 7 & phone activated, not supposed to. 2nd, unknown apps from europe & netherlands constantly trying to download, this went on from 8pm to 6am when i shut phone down.  was 100% charged @ 8pm & down to 10% @ 6am.  it would not do screen shots.  verizon tech & i tried to put phone in safe mode & this would not work, i could go on & on, it cost me my time @ verizon store 2hrs, plus time re-downloading all my apps, ring tones.  for a company that showed 99% reviews favorable what a scam.  additional cost of zagg screen saver & protective case.  also time on face of phone kept rocking between pt to military time, wierd, plus giving bogus local temp.  110 outside phone showing 76. ordered wireless charger to go with phone,  tried to save some$ but in the long run ordered new from verizon.
love the phone, but unfortunately the first one i was sent was defective.  after about 400 phone calls, i finally got my hands on one that works properly and i'm in love. never thought i'd be happy to leave apple, but i definitely am!
update: after rebooting the phone 5 times and doing a system update i was finally able to use the fingerprint sensor to unlock my phone. i should not have had to go through all that frustration,  but i think i may have fixed the problem.  :(i would give this company zero stars if i could. i received the phone and when i put the sim in i keep getting a notification that unauthorized actions have been detected. because if this, i cannot use many apps, including the fingerprint security and samsung’s own health app. i have restarted the phone to no avail. i then did a factory reset and that didn’t work. i still get the same message. this phone is a piece of you know what. i am sending it back for a full refund. unfortunately, this company will probably just send the defective phone to the next person who orders one so buys beware! 😡🤬
for what it's worth, i bought my phone from dealfisher and it was great. battery is very strong and only one or two minor scratches that suggest this thing was hardly used. it was no trouble getting this phone switched over to my existing verizon service. last thing to note was that my package just included the phone and charger without any other extras. that's fine with me. just happy i got a good one!
great phone overall when battery isn't dieing. purchased this phone thinking it was great deal since it was refurbished. however my battery life is horrible phone dies in like 2 hours. i need to get a battery replacement now. phone performance is good and has very nice camera. i'm just a little salty because in constantly having to charge my phone.**** i had to get different phone battery was horrible feel ripped off
so when i was initially looking to buy a new phone i knew that i didn't need the newest or shiniest phone so i decided to buy a phone that was a few generations back. but i debated about where to buy a used phone. i researched for a long time and went back and forth with a lot of websites and amazon had the cheapest price, which made me both happy and a little bit warry. but i decided to go with the phone on amazon, i choose my seller carefully to a one that had good reviews and a high quantity of reviews. when it came the phone had no defects and looked brand new! it didn't have a  sim card (but i knew it wouldn't) all in all great phone great deal! i waited to write my review for a couple of months just to make sure. so i highly reccomend buying a used phone.
perfect quality and flawless performance. i had a brand new galaxy s7, which i lost after about 6 months of use, and i decided to replace it with this refurbished s7. because i had been using the exact same (but brand new) phone just prior to using this refurbished, i can undoubtedly confirm that this performs the same, and it looks and feels brand new as well. no scratches, no dings, not even any dirt or dust in the speaker grill etc. at first i was hesitant to purchase a refurbished phone, but all my worries were for no reason with this seller. thank you!
i bought this phone to replace my aging s4 that was still working but getting tired. the s4 was in an otter box all it's life and had a few battery replacements since i bought it new. back in those days smartphones were free when you signed a 2 year contract so i had a bit of sticker shock when i went phone shopping. i'm over 60 and retired, i just don't need the latest gadget filled cell phone.i read all the reviews for this s7 phone on amazon and found a wide mix of comments from junk to like new condition. the thing that sold me on this one is that amazon certified it with this statement ""a certified refurbished product has been tested and certified to work and look like new, with minimal to no signs of wear, by a 3rd party distributor""certified to work and look like new from amazon's description means to me i could return the phone if i was not completely satisfied with it's condition. the 3rd party distributor for my phone was kiss electronics.i live in socal and ordered the phone with prime 2 day delivery, to my surprise it arrived the very next day!first impressions,i opened the prime box to find a generic phone box inside. when i opened the phone box i found the phone, a wall charger, and a phone number for kiss electronics customer support, that's it. no manual, no release key for the sim card and no instruction manual. i was soon encouraged by the like new external condition of the phone and i saw what appeared to be a factory original peel off plastic screen cover on it.  i plugged it into the provided amazon marked charger to find the battery was completely discharged. i found a safety pin to release the sim card holder and quickly realized my old s4 verizon sim card was way to big to fit. the next day i went to the verizon store and they happily supplied me with a nano sim card. i asked them if they could transfer all my old contact info from the old sim to the new one and i was told that is not possible. now that i know about the sim card data transfer problem, i would have used google in advance to back up all my data first before going to the verizon store. oh well, i transferred all my data the old fashioned way, hey i'm retired, who cares.after getting the new nano sim card installed i was ready to try out the phone.i turned the phone on to update my contacts, then decided to check for android operating system updates. i found that it was currently running marshmallow 6.0.  i updated the first, then the second, then the 3rd. on and on for a total of about 7 different operating system updates, it took a few hours to complete all the upgrades. it updated all the way to oreo v. 8.0. this is when i realized this must be a new old stock phone that has not ever been operated or used before.i had read that manufactures (like samsung) often have many brand new phones that are earmarked for their warranty exchange programs. i suspect these phones were new phones that were not needed by the manufacture and were sold at auction to various electronic device distributors (like kiss electronics)i have had the phone now for about a week. after removing the bloatware and configuring it the way i want it, i am very happy with it. i would highly recommend this phone for anyone on a budget or whoever doesn't need the latest and greatest cell phone on the market. i rate my entire experience with amazon and kiss electronics a+
aside from a little rash around the charging port from being used, the phone was like new. no scratches, no issues. phone been working great so far. bought it for my wife, i may order myself one now.update: 09/12/18i purchased this to replace my wife's galaxy s5 (i am still using mine).  since she bought it i have not been happy with her call quality.  i have a hard time understanding her unless she speaks deliberately and clearly.  5 months later i realize that we are not being connected using the hd voice option on verizon phones. the ""advanced calling"" options are not present on this phone.  i spent hours with vzw support and samsung support to no avail.  samsung told me that a phone that has been unlocked does not have these features.  verizon says that this must not have been a verizon phone and that's why it is not available.  the phone i bought from deal fisher was supposed to be a verizon phone and was not listed as an unlocked phone.  ultimately i am overly disappointed.  my s5 has way better call quality and now i am hesitant to replace it with another one off of amazon.
phone did not have software compatible with verizon and so cannot be activated. despite multiple attempts to factory reset and to update the software through verizon's software tool on my computer, i cannot use the phone with a new sim card from verizon. since it was sold as a verizon phone, that renders it essentially useless to me. after spending 2 hours on the phone with verizon tech support, following by 2 hours of my own time attempting to reset the phone, i'll be returning this for a refund. i still have no phone, after waiting over a week for this one--an enormous waste of time for a useless device.my options now include rolling the device and waiting another week to get a new phone from amazon/this seller, or switching to another seller and phone on verizon. either way, i'm left without a working device for another week.
the phone was suppose to be black.  i received gold and also it was built for service in vietnam.phone says it is g930v but it is actually g930u.  also, it is not really a samsung galaxy s7 but a replica (fake) settings do not allow for hd voice/ video chat.
i purchased this to replace my samsung galaxy note 4 that bricked on me last weekend.  the refurbished price is so much better than new from verizon.  when the phone arrived, it was in a plain box, and no oem charger (but i have one from my other phone so no big deal).  the phone works great!  setup was a breeze.  i've used it pretty heavily the past week (so many new features with latest os) - and it's great. no complaints.
i've been a samsung user since 2012, and over the course of 6 years i've had the galaxy s3, galaxy, s4, note 5, and this phone (s7). i'm not sure if it's the phone's status as certified refurbished, but this is the laggiest phone with the shortest battery life of any samsung i've ever had. i probably charge this 4x a day, using it from about 10am to 10pm. the functionality is all right, as it hasn't fully frozen yet, but even texting causes a lag. maybe it's just the device i received, though, bc this doesn't seem to be many people's experience?
got this for my husband, after all the problems he has with cell's, he likes this one!fast shipping, just as described and in minutes it was running on our verizon!update, the phone has died, they have sealed battery and it just won't charge any more, didn't even get 1 year out of it, so sad!
i ordered this, came in three days, took it up to verizon, and within half and hour i was on my way with seemingly a brand new phone.  i do not see any difference between my phone, and my sisters who we bought brand new from verizon a few years ago.  it was very easy, and affordable and worked like new at verizon.  the phone itself was blank, with generic google apps.  no earbuds, but that wasn't in the description.  it did come with a charger, and plastic wrapping around it.  i had a really great experience, would do again.
this phone does what i need. it isn't so large it can't be put in a pocket, which is important to me. i put a zagg screen protector on it and have it in a case and with a bit of luck it will last a couple of years. the cost to replace with a refurbished was about the same as i anticipated spending on repairs. unfortunately, modern phones with water resistance include glues that are difficult to remove to make a repair a self-service option unless one is truly determined.
buyer beware! it says verizon wireless but these are not verizon branded phones. that means no voicemail and several other key apps that can only be pre-installed by verizon. you cannot get these apps from play store or anywhere else.
fantastic battery life, works exactly as needed. definitely worth the price of not getting the newest galaxy for 3 times the price. only issue is it appears to run slower then my last phone (galaxy s5) but not by a frustrating amountbe prepared for endless updates when first starting the phone

four month's into owning what i thought was a decent phone, it has turned into a brick.  listening to music last night i heard a peculiar zip like sound and the music stopped.  i knew it was fully charged, but it wouldn't respond to any button pressing.  i tried plugging it in this morning with no effect.  later my screen lit up with nothing but static.  i'm not sure what  to replace it with.  new phones are prohibitively expensive.
we decided to purchase an s7 for my wife (the year is 2018) because her iphone 6 crapped out at the 1st sign of water. she saw how mine has been with us since our wedding day in reliability, functionality, so we decided to get a refurbished on amazon since they don't make them anymore. she loves it, although there's a learning curve coming from iphone, it works great and the battery life is like it was new. were running these bases boys into the ground.
we were so sad when my husband fatally crunched his relatively new (to us) samsung galaxy s-7 cell phone - right after we had ordered a new case for it.  we were thrilled the kiss electronics could replace it with a refurbished phone at a reasonable price.  we have now restored all of the features that were on the old phone and life is good! thanks, kiss!!
this was an upgrade phone for me, and i really like the phone. it has been easy to use, the battery life is wonderful (my old phone wouldn't hold a charge throughout the day anymore). the price was great, considering i was looking at phones for three-to-five hundred dollars. very similar to my old samsung phone, so easy to figure out some newer features.
i have friends with the same phone,  and even running just the factory installed apps my battery life was terrible compared to theirs.  i ended up buying a replacement oversized battery and opening up the phone and replacing it. kind of a pain, but that's life when you buy refurbished stuff i guess.
refurbished and battery had a overheating problem.  i found out after that refurbished phones do have this issue a lot.
was not notified that the device was rooted, the whole reason why i was sticking to samsung is to use the samsung pass and pay, did not even bother inquiring about having full functionality on the samsung.
wedeliverwireless - phone came damaged there are small cracks in the screen and the area where you plug it in to charge has most of the paint around it scratched off, when i purchased this phone before it was from sikksound did a great job, the phone came in a flawless conditionedit: the phone no longer works due to ""moisture detected"" and is unable to charge
we received this phone with a poorly placed screen protector that had dust stuck under it. upon peeling it up we found the screen scuffed, and the home button worn completely down and scratched. disappointing, especially considering shipping took a week.
few scuffs and scratches but it was refurbished so no big surprise. phone was completely dead so i put it on the charger. it started to charge for less than a minute and the charging box made a really weird noise then it popped and stopped working. the phone went off and came back on by itself. i guess it was a problem with the charger because i've had no problems with the phone since i started using my old charging box.
i've ordered a number of used cell phones and had to send a few back. the ones from prime mobility have always held up and outlasted any others! this s7 was great. amazing condition and everything synched up right away after putting my sim in. battery life has been good as well. will always go to prime mobility storefront first!!
a refurbished phone that looks new.  i upgraded from an s4 and the speed of the s7 is much better along with 16 more gb.  the colors are crisp and i love the ""push the home button twice"" feature that takes you directly to the camera.  great phone!
seems to work pretty well, been using this for about 4 months now and it hasnt been slowing or breaking down so far. comes with charger but the adapters kind of a knock off, it works fine but of course its not as good as the original fast charging adapter. nice of them to apply a hard plastic screen protecter since there us a very and ever so slight crack on the screen but pretty unnoticeable when using it but i had to remove the protector since it made the touch screen less sensitive and can barely activate any button. also overtime the battery may drain alil faster, i try to restart my phone every once a week or turn off battery saving when im home to lessen the problem. overall good price and works well!
i bought this phone about a week ago and so far, i have been very impressed with it. it came rather fast and sooner than expected. when i took the phone out of the box, it looked brand new with no scratches or obvious imperfections. the phone started right up and the screen looked perfect. overall, i'm very impressed with this phone and would greatly consider buying another phone from ths company in the future.
out of this box this phone was almost like new. just needed to get a sim card from diamond wireless and everything works like new. functionality works as expected and the s7 is great phone overall. this is a great product and even though a couple models old, performs admirably in comparison with all of the newer phones.
the s7 arrived in perfect condition.couldn't tell the difference, between refurbished and newset up was a breeze. i would buy it again.
i managed to get my old phone switched to this phone with out a problem but i believe the touch screen is not right. it randomly shows as if i'm clicking all over, send random gibberish and opens crazy apps. i tried powering down and can't touch power button since the touch screen shows as if i'm touching randomly all over the screen. it's extremely slow and glitchy where apps just start flashing and close. i can't type a text with out having to hit some spots in multiple areas and tack out letters not really typed. last night it was at 6% battery and after sitting on my night stand charging for 2 hours was only up to 12%
ok i can't really afford phones, i have page plus and need unlocked phones. i had an s3 and the highest i could afford was an s7. it looks like new, its fast, it activated just fine with page plus. i've had it about a week and am very addicted. i am comparing this against my s3 but i'm very happy with this purchase!!!
this is a much more fiscally sound purchase than a galaxy s8 from the carrier. i had some reservations about it being refurbished and worried the the carrier would give me trouble when i got it activated, but everything has been just fine.  :-)
i was a little concerned ordering a phone online, but it was a great experience.  arrived timely.  looks brand new.  no wear and tear at all.  the battery is so much better than my note 4.  i do miss the camera on my note 4, but still good quality pictures.  i actually like the smaller size.  fits in my pants pocket and it is much easier to deal with on a daily basis.
no problems.  always look at ratings for the refurbisher you order from.  my refurbished s7 has performed like new for a fraction of the cost of a new phone.
constantly dropped signal. never able to call, but sometimes texts would work.returned itbought from buysprythey were helpful, but couldn't get me another in time so i went with someone else.also the thumb button was scratched.the phone itself was awesome though! love the photos it takes!
mobilespee said phone was a verizon wireless phone which was not. phone would not hold a charge, would not update. verizon representative tried to install information but phone kept shutting off so they couldn't get anything through it. guess you never know what junk you buy it sellers are dishonest!!
first-time used phone buyer here. i read a lot of reviews before buying a refurbished galaxy s7. most were negative, but i took a chance anyway. i'm only one week in on this purchase but so far, i'm very pleased. the only indications that this isn't a brand new phone are there's a bit of dust/crud in the charging port, and the after-market charger vs. a samsung-branded charger. otherwise, it seems to be in perfect condition. i did have to do several software updates back to back, but i don't think that's unusual.
worth every penny, the screen wasn't scratched, looks like brand new, i like the new features of the s7.  upgraded from an s5, such a difference
my refurbished samsung galaxy 7 came flawless, and, after inserting consumer cellular sim card, and 64 gig storage , and learning my new phone, it does some amazing things, and, takes cool photo's and videos on voice command.
arrived on time and in excellent condition.  i installed a separately-purchased verizon sim, contacted verizon for activation assistance and was up and running less than 20 minutes later.  i should also add that the battery works as though it had been replaced and the case is free from any signs of wear.  excellent value.
i'm honestly blown away at this phone. i ordered it expecting the worst, despite the great reviews. i have had zero issues with my phone in the 2 weeks that i got it. the only thing that i questioned was the fact that i had to do 4 system updates, but once it got caught up everything was great. the phone looks and performs as if it were a brand new phone.
screen is in near excellent condition (one miniscule scratch you have to look for). back has expected wear from a cheap case.  only real concern is whoever had this phone before obviously hadn't heard of gently plugging something in (paint scratched off in several areas around charge port area).  overall though for a refurb and less than half what i paid for this model new last year, not too shabby!
came on time. came in prime condition. - the phone itself is absolutely excellent. i began using it every day, it even has made my life at work far easier. it counts my steps with samsung health, and is helping me to stay healthier. great choice. great smart phone!
it's been just over 3 months since i bought the phone, and already the charger port is finnicky and a pain. i will add, i only charge when the battery is low and never overnight. if the phone isn't held at a specific angle, it will not charge. should have just bought the s8 from verizon directly.
the only signs of wear are the witness marks from the previous owner's case and a scratch on the home button. the button and fingerprint reader work fine. the screen is perfect. battery seems pretty good. processor is pretty quick. i did have to go to the verizon store to get a nano sim card as my existing sim card didn't fit (this was free & painless). perfect buy for those that aren't cool with spending $600+ on the newest smartphone.
advertised as a g930v (verizon) what was actually delivered was a 930u... no wi-fi calling, no voicemail notifications (have to dial *86 to find out if you have a voicemail)
there is something wrong with the phone, it doesn't always charge, and it when it does it doesnt always go to fast charging mode, other than that its a nice phone but i wish to have it fixed. i am definitely willing to give it a higher rate if the company can reach to me and fix it.
my wife needed to upgrade her s6, but did not want or need the latest and greatest.  this was the perfect solution, and half the price that verizon wanted charge.  it was easy setup and transfer from her old phone.  we are happy!
tried to activate my phone with verizon but it turns out that the device was on a list of lost or stolen phones and therefore was not eligible to be activated. in the few minutes that i did have the phone on and running the battery become increasingly hot.
battery life was just like my samsung 3. froze a few times within the first week. product was returned. however, company worked well with us and we'd use them again.
the banner says i purchased this . however i returned it because the micro usb charging slot held the usb loosely so did not charge consistently in the car or any situation that moved. wireless charging was ok but i did not want to rely soley on wireless charging. otherwise, the phone itself worked fine.
our second mistake.  we purchased this phone after making things mistake once before.  we purchased from another amazon seller hoping for a more successful experience.  again, the phone came with an at&t symbol on the back.  uh oh. this phone was more dinged up and in worse condition than the first phone we purchased. we took the phone to a verizon store to put on our plan.  it didn't work.  the phone will not work on a verizon line.  they tried to help us sincerely, but to no success.
like this phone! looks brand new. all functions and battery life are great. was initially concerned with buying a refurbished phone, i couldn't be happier. mine came from cell surfers for a very reasonable price.
says it is verizon phone (originally) i took it to a verizon store to activate it and transfer my # and they couldnt get it working. they ended up buying the phone from me and giving me a deal on a galaxy s8 plus.
looks and functions like new, at a fraction of the cost from verizon.  and i don't see any issues with the battery life either.  my colleagues who seem inclined to empty their wallets for the sheer joy of spending on gadgets have sheepishly started asking me for the amazon link for this.
arrived quickly and exactly as promised.  works well!
product arrived in great condition. some scuff marks around the micro usb port, but they were almost unnoticible. other than that its looks like a brand new phone.i upgraded from a note 3, so i did have to change my sim card to a smaller format, so if your replacing an older phone just something to be aware of. verizon changed my sim card for free, so wasn't an issue.at first felt tiny compared to the note 3, but i adjusted in few days. i am happy with my purchase.
i've had this phone for ~5 months now and the battery is definitely showing its age (day 1, default setting- overnight- ie not using it all: 13% drain over 12 hours. as of this writing, 27% drain over 12 hours).  but other than that, everything was in perfect condition.
the camera, the whole reason i bought this phone, stopped working right after the return period ended. i've had this phone just a few months and already need to replace it. not stoked.
arrive in great shape and works great!
phone came in good condition. has a crack on the bottom part of the back camera. but that doesn't affect the phone at all and it doesn't affect the water resistancy on the camera. so far i'm pretty happy with it. but i'll need time to adjust to the size and button placement  differences. (previously  had a moto g6)
should have been able tip use with my carrier, but it only works with verizon. slightly disappointed as i don't like verizon!
overall, the phone is nice and has some good features. however, when it arrived, the screen was scratched and the back had some marks on it too. the battery life is good (lasts about a full day).
arrived in excellent condition. was a gift for someone else, they didn't even know it wasn't new. very pleased.
bought certified refurbished s7.  battery life out of the box is terrible. standby battery life was 8 hours in normal mode.  power saving mode was a little better, but still not good enough to be any way equivalent to a new phone.  phone is supposed to have 12 days of standby time and 27 hours of usage time.
looks and works as a brand new phone, at half the price. activated immediately on verizon, and works exactly as it should.
it looks and works like a new phone.  much better than spending $1000.00 for a new phone.
appears new, came with genuine samsung fast charger. arrived when expected. beautiful and fast. really like nougat. saved a ton of money.
was not clear that you wont get all tools needed to install sim card and mirco card. also not loaded up like phone you get from verizon. phone itself works great but need to load up some features that come with the one that you buy from verizon
works well, happy with purchase.
bought for my 11 y.o. son. he was able to operate it straight out of the box and has had no issues since.
dials on its own
i am so disappointed. well just mad. amazon should be ashamed to sale this garbage.  i purchased this phone to replace my phone. i took it into version and it will not read the sim card. he told me it definitely is not a verizon phone. i was so mad i just trained it in for a new phone.
looks and works like new.  love it.  2 generations behind saves big bucks!!
i can only say that i felt robbed on this purchase when i took this phone in to get a sim card from verizon i was informed that the imei number was flagged, it was either stolen or the account was being held for non-payment. subsequently the following imei number cannot be connected.
phone is working great, and i have it activated with verizon.
i ordered a g930v, planning to possibly unlock it, but when it arrived i was pleasantly suprised to find it was actually a g930u, so unlocking was completely unnecessary. bonus! although the phone is refurbished, it seems good as new. my only gripe is the lack of an ir blaster, so i'll be keeping my s6 around to control those odd devices i don't have the remote for (laserdisc, ced, vcr)
i'm always leery buying something used that's electronic.  i was not disappointed.  the phone looks like new and works great.
so far so good.  phone seems to work well.battery seems to be very warm after little usage.  disappointed there were stickers on the back and the sim card key was not included but that is the risk with refurbished.  phone appearance is perfect otherwise so far.
the phone showed up in good condition very slight signs of wear, i think the whole refurbished thing might be a bit of a joke but it does carry a good guarantee  and is an easy return to amazon if you are not satisfied. the battery on mine was a little week unfortunately but it will do
i was a bit aprehensive ordering a refurbished phone sight unseen but i have to say it was everything described and a bit more.
had to return as phone was not working. tech support started out helpful then i was bounced around between several different people and became a mess. phone would not register letters properly when typed so couldn't access the phone.
i bought this phone as a gift for someone in mexico and the phone works very well. it has a small cosmetic damage in the corner (nothing to worry). the phone came in a generic box without headphones but still i am satisfied with the purchase.
i haven’t had to use tech support yet, but the phone has been great! no signs of damage. a tiny bit of wear around the charging port but that it all. the battery has a great amount of life left in it. i can easily go a whole day with vigorous use and still have power left.
very impressed for a refurbished phone, basically impossible to tell it was not a brand new phone.  works fine.
the phone came as advertised and on time.
my samsung 7 arrived defective. the speaker is busted, nothing but static noise. very disappointed
i took a chants and it paid off. my phone was like bran new and worked like bran new. i read most of the reviews before i ordered.
i bought 2 of these, both had horrible battery life. didn't realize just how bad it was until i replaced the first one with a new one. just by new!
phone was in good condition, sim card wouldn't read the verizon card so it was useless
the phone won't turn on straight out of the package, it goes to galaxy s7 when attached to  a charger and at no other time, then cuts back off. don't know who to talk too, because i removed the back to check if any parts were missing and the back plate cracked during removal, not sure if i can still return it or not. not even sure who i should direct my questions too.
the phone i bought had some issues with it, but once i got a new one sent to me it had all the issues fixed. may be best to go with a different phone rather than struggle with the issues i had too. (battery drain quickly, late shipping, low quality screen - burned in images)the new one works fine but the process was a struggle.something to keep in mind is that the phone likely won't have a warranty on it from samsung so good luck!
exactly what we were after works perfectly
been using this phone for over a year now and it works great. when i first got it there was some deep scratches on the home button but other than that one cosmetic flaw everything works great and ive had no issues!!!
arived faster than expected, in pristine condition. there was no sim caddy ejection tool, but a paper clip works just as well. this phone cam with factory released firmare and had to go through a dozen update cycles one after the other to get up to oreo with the december security release, so be patient and keep applying the updates, it is not in an infinite loop.
had to return at my cost for $12.50. phone rebooted constantly. no trouble shooting would correct problem. research suggest its operating system hardware problem. maybe cannot be detected on standard precertified protocol checks. vendor accepted return but i had to pay postage. got replacement phone from same vendor but used prime this time. very satisfied with new phone. .
pros: phone came well packaged and in perfect condition. works great in terms of functionality, not disappointed in the samsung s series yet.cons: battery life very bad. gets hot when downloading, loses 10-15% of battery in an hour under normal use...e.g. calling, whatsapp, some browsing. thinking of returning.
despite receiving the phone with cracks in the top left corner, the phone was operational. would have returned if her other phone had not stopped working. feel like i paid too much for a cracked phone.
i am revising an earlier 1 star review to 3. i thought there was glue residue near the charging port but it's just all scratched up by the previous owner putting charging cable in carelessly. i'm a little disappointed but ok due to the good price on the phone and really fast shipment.
the description says it's a verizon phone, but the one i received was at&t and would not work at verizon. they told me that after i went to get it set up at my closest verizon store, so i had to pay return shipping, and am now waiting for a refund, and need to begin the search for an actual verizon compatible phone all over again!
battery was bad so much for a refurbished unit......would only last 2- 21/2 hrs....luv the phone.....but the supplier is not so good. i received the phone today....3 hrs charging and the setup with verizon.....i am trying another unit from a different supplier......we shall see
big improvement over older samsung phones. refurbished or not it works and looks new.
everything else considered, this was a good buy. however, one fatal flaw right from the beginning when i first turned it on, i immediately noticed there was screen burn in. it was faint, but it is definitely noticeable
this refurbished phone is like new!  also, i really like the phone!  i've had for a few months and it hasn't failed yet. :)
i purchased this phone for my daughter. it came in great condition with no blemishes or scratches and it started right up. we took it to verizon and in a matter of moments had a new sim card and she was up and running. so far so good.
not compatible with verizon as advertised!!!!! disappointed. be warned it may not work.
phone was bought to replace my galaxy s5.  so far, so good. the only concern is the embedded battery, which is fine for now.
i was extremely sceptical about buying a refurbished phone. after buying 2 refurbished samsunge galexys7 for my husband and i, we will never buy  brand new phones again. they works just as good as a new phone and we have had no issues. i have had this phone for 2 months and have dropped it multiple times and it still works perfect. definately glad i took a chance on buying these phone. i love it!
just like all the other reviews say. great battery life and very fast. has a lot of other conveniences my s5 didnt
i bought this phone for my 11 year old son after buying a reburbished google pixel from another website that we ended up returning because we couldn't get wifi to work on it.  i am very pleased with this phone. it's a great phone for a middle school boy. the price was right, it shipped fast and the battery stays charged for a long time as well.
received a bad battery. the top of screen was cracked. very disappointed that these are the standards allowed on amazon.
i received my samsung galaxy s7 in a timely manner. it was spotless except for a few minor scratches on the bottom button which shouldn't be anything that effects functionality. installed my sim card and i'm up and running smoothly.
verizon tech could not get the phone to activate, tried 2 new sims. in the return-exchange process now.
my phone started giving me problems right before the warranty ran out. i sent it in and they fixed it. however, once i got the phone back, there was a brand new problem which they refused to fix because by that time my warranty had run out. i sent several emails and finally requested to be contacted by a supervisor, which never happened. would not buy from them again.
most of the phone was in new condition, however the metal bezel around the rear camera, the glass in front of the flash, and the home button were all scratched. so far works well.
both phones showed up on time and have been excellent. the extra shatter proof glass they provided for free was a nice bonus
i like this phone very much. however the refurbished model i bought has a short battery life, does not get me through a day. also, the phone was sitting in my car no one touching it and i look down and suddenly it had a crack across the front screen. :/ :(
it came before the actual due date, which that was great! unfortunately when i activated the phone, it would constantly restart itself. tried rebooting it. still was restarting, the firm ware is damaged.
the s6 i had was bad all around, but i love the s7.
love this phone. i switched from apple and i'm a samsung person now. the phone works great- no problems at all. i bought my husband one shortly after i got mine, and they are excellent phones. very happy!!
everything i need it to do.
i bought this phone in july, the phone is overheating and the battery doesn’t work!
microphone doesn't work. when i researched, i found that is a common problem.
arrived as promised, was in excellent condition; came with charger.  this phone works great and was easy to activate with a verizon sim card
i received the phone. it would not charge, and ran really slow. very disappointed.
love it!
love my phone.. it looks brand new. arrived on time. just hate the battery doesn't last long
very happy with my purchase. speedy delivery. no hitches with start up. everything worked as expected. friendly personnel at kiss electronics and easy to deal with.
the phone seems to have a problem with the speaker phone and the charger is not compatible with the phone.
message and email notifications don't work. the phone keeps downloading an update, but won't complete the install, bad buy.
the phone arrived on time, works really well so far, and looks like new.  i am very happy with it.  the only problem is that it came with an iphone charger instead of the correct charger.
everything is working well and my transfer of data and sim card was easy from my galaxy s6.
love my new galaxy s7 but most of all i love the camera in the quality of pictures it takes and that's the reason i bought it the shipping was fast got it in 2 days with no problems easy to set up with no problems
great condition!
this is the most worth it phone out right now.
phone arrived in its packaged, covered in bubble wrap, with its charger and cable. other than the most superficial, invisible scratch on this screen, the phone is virtually in perfect condition. refurbished items are just getting better and better these days.
wrote an email requesting a return label for this item as it is defective and never heard back. no phone number listed. this phone does not charge and i want to be refunded!
so far so good, the wife loves it!
samsung galaxy s7 is a great phone! not the latest galaxy by any means, but much better than the s4 i replaced it with.
bought this phone may 18...it is now august 1st...the phone no longer works, you can open the screen but cannot get to the homepage.  they do not offer warranty so there goes $200+ right in the trash.
this phone is not unlocked! it is only allowing verizon sim cards not any other carrier.
do not buy this phone from tech venture they are not verizon phones and can’t be activated.... such a waste of time
it works.
been using it for about 4 months first month it wanted to update 10+  times a day i guess it caught up with where it needed to be. overall it's a working phone
decided to try reconditioned phone. turn out to be excellent choice. very hard to tell it isn't new. highly recommend.
great phone
great phone for the money.
i love the phone i think the battery life is short but i think is for some of my configuration but in conclusion excellent phone and in the time expected ^_^
after i let it sit and charge for a little while, the phone has worked perfect after. after a close ans detailed inspection, there is absolutely no damage anywhere. the phone is fast, sleek, and is just like a brand new phone.
perfect! all good!
arrived right on time, looks like brand new and working great
product came looking like new. everything seems to be working wonderfully. verizon had no issues when i went to have them set it up. i'm loving the samsung s7!
battery life is kinda bad. has some scratches on the corners and a big scratch on the fingerprint sensor. but overall works good and the camera too.
cool
arrived in time.  activated without issue. audio sounds tinny compared with working unit not refurbished.  good price.
purchased for my mom and she loves this phone. great buy for the money and no defects.
bought as a present for my sister she no longer annoys me
this phone looks brand new for being refurbished. love it
this phone has no problem with connectivity inside metal structures where my co-workers have difficulty with reception and dropped calls. also, i'm experiencing improved wifi reception over my previous phone!
good phone
the phone seems to be as good as new. i love it!!
the charging port did not function well upon arrival. i have to literally hold the charger in the charger port with force to charge. this product is not functional since i cannot charge. do not purchase
phone is a technical marvel. so far the only issue with it is the battery life.  literally  see the battery  drain by the minute. maybe since it's refurbished the battery is older than expected.  don't know.
works exactly as advertised
this phone is not unlock!!
this phone although not being up to date is a great phone. the battery life is long and the phone functions impeccably.
it is like brand new !
the phone i received worked almost perfectly and was in very good shape. there was an issue with the fingerprint scanner which i've yet to fix (if it can even be fixed), but that's the only issue i've come upon. otherwise, it's fully functional and more than worth the price.
very disappointed with this phone. battery life is very poor. i doubt this phone will make in more than a month.
feels like a brand new galaxy s7 even though it is refurbished.
better than the s7 edge.  at least you can find a protective case that works on this one.  with the edge...the edge is unprotected and it broke when i dropped it on the edge
the phone arrived in perfect condition.  i am so glad i bought it.  my very first smartphone.  i knew that the battery would need to be replaced.
love the phone. recieved on time
was not as described!!! phone is not unlocked!!! i have called the company over 3 times and they never answer or return my call after leaving several voicemails!!!
when i opened this i instantly saw the missing back cover, but when i tried to turn it in the screen wouldn't work (by screen i mean the screen itself turning on so i could see what i was doing). the touch screen was still working though.
i give this phone no stars. my boyfriend couldn’t connect his phone to verizon because it was on verizon’s blacklist as a stolen phone. now his line is disconnected and we have to get a hold of amazon to get a refund and he doesn’t have a phone! ugh.
couldn't use the phone at all because it can't recognize a sim card
ended up taking phone into verzion to set up and we were told that even with a verizon sim card, we were not able to use the phone on verizon network.
ordered a phone. when the package arrived all the box had in it was a generic phone charger.
like new, love it!
i have the international version of the s7 for a non-verizon line and it works fine. i tried this verizon version of the phone for a verizon line and it had a problem unlocking from the home screen. three times it just wouldn't unlock and i had to do a complete system wipe and reboot. i picked up a second verizon version of the phone from a big box store and after a few days of use it too became stuck in an endless loop when i tried to unlock it. i am starting to think the verizon version of this phone has some issue with unlocking.
we have one of these so we knew what to expect.  this is a replacement for a galaxy s5 that was lost.  now our phones can use the same charger, etc.
i ordered a black phone for my son and received a rose gold phone. the phone is working good but my son definitely wasn't happy with the color.
arrived early, thank you.  back plastic has crack in it. still works.  son doesn't want to give it up to wait for return/exchange hassles.
the only thing that i didn't like about the phone was that it was not compatible with my boost network and it have to be sent back.
cell phone worked and looked like new devise.  i am happy with my purchase!
i am new to this phone, but have found it very easy to navigate.
bought 2 for my wife and i. we're with metropcs and i switched the sim card into this phone and followed the instructions that came on a card with the phones. it didn't work at first, so i went to the metropcs store and they sold me 2 new sim cards and they both started working just fine. called to activate and they both work great. these were verizon branded phones, so we had to disable some built in software, but no big deal.
everything about this phone is great. we bought another one.
received the phone,  looks good, but when went to activate it, i was informed by verizon that the phone wasn't paid off by the previous owner, is on a nonpay list,  and can't be activated it.i have contacted the seller, and will update when i hear back from them.
piece of junk phone. many issues, keeps randomly shutting down...buy from somewhere else..
the phone has terrible burn-in pixels on every screen. without a replacement i would never recommend this to anyone.
i bought a ""certified"" samsung s& from sikksound for $327.00. after 3 months, the battery swelled and rendered the phone unuseable. sikksound did not offer a replacement or a refund even though the device was defective. the were completely unhelpful.
the phone is absolutely stupendous. i had no complaints with it. however, after the 3 month warranty from dealfisher was up, not even a week afterwards, the phone turned off while i was asleep, the phone on the charger, and never turned on again. it only heats up when plugged into the charger. right after the warranty was up... meh. very disappointed in this.
great condistikn
charging area is scratched up, facebook app image is burnt into the screen, it looks like they tried to pull the back of the phone off. it works, and that's what i needed, but i'm going to toss it and buy a new phone the moment i'm able to since this one is in such poor condition.
useless without the pin tool to open the sim card port. seriously people. how do you forget that!
bought this phone in the description that says it was an unlocked phone turned it on starter to use it would not let me use it because it says it is verizon wireless only
i bought this phone since i broke my ipad badly. the phone looks like brand new works very well but the battery life is not that good. however, overall, i really satisfied with this.
terrible should've never bought this piece of junk. it's done nothing but glitch since i got it. never buying a refurbished phone again.
normal
overall, this phone does what it needs to!performs better than average across the spectrum. not the end all be all phone, but good enough to last a couple years!
perfect
received  quickly and it works like new
my phone worked great for about 6 months until 2 days ago it turned off and never turned back on again. so i then had to purchase a new phone due to it breaking out of nowhere
grate
the performance was as if brand new. the screen had a small dead spot when the brightness was low. i sent it in and got another one from buyspry instead. this one is perfect.
this phone works fantastically, battery life is decent, and the phone is quite fast. the speaker on the galaxy s7 is not as loud as the s6 but still works okay.
phone has a small crack on the back glass. and a small chip on the edge of the front screen. other than that it functions properly
was leery of buying given the horror stories of vendors with amazon.  happy to report, no problems (yet) after several weeks.  verizon mailed me a free sim card (no need to buy one) and i installed a 64 gb ram card along side it for a few more bucks.  why buy a highly fragile s8 for twice the price when you can get this one?  it came new in the box.  did not have original charger, other than that just fine.  might buy another one.
arrived in a timely fashion. phone looks great!
thanks
it is not unlocked for verizon, as stated, but for tmobile, making it useless to me.
product and quality was exactly as advertised. phone is like new and works perfectly. this is a great option for someone who wants a quality phone but for whom the latest generation ""new"" phone is not a must - have.
great device, it only seems to run short on the baterie duration. for the rest, its a great device.
the phone seems to be great so far! this seller has contacted me to make sure everything is going well with the phone. i am a happy customer so far!
a+, would buy again. only had small indications of previous use.
great phone! no problems ! works just like new!
despite clearly stating that this was for use on verizon, the phone arrived set up for tmobile. useless and waste of my time.
works well, battery could've been swapped tho
the home button on the samsung galaxy 7 was chipped and the finish was half gone.
great phone and the price is awesome ….the phone is just like new every thing works great ..
the phone was super nice and feels practically new. i didn't notice any scratches and it runs great
it's a good phone if you aren't looking for something fancy. was a great buy!
no se explica que el teléfono no tendría un sistema global, solo sería americano.
perfect
just missing the tool to access sim card.
el teléfono no viene desbloqueado....lo considero in engaño.solo permite sim de verizone
after 4 months the phone screen has a purple tint under which has made the phone useless.
product is not a factory unlocked phone.  product received is a verizon phone, with all of the associated bloatware.i was able to get it to work for cricket (my service provider) after fiddling with settings and a lot of time digging through the internet.
everything is perfect! thanks a lot)))
it just that the home button is too far from it's position from that it is good
this is a really nice product, especially for the price.
while all functions of the phone work as advertised, the battery life of the phone is so poor that it absolutely eclipses every other possible positive quality of this. im currently getting only 6 hours of battery life worth only one hour of screen on time nested within the same time. this means that if i leave my house for drinks at 8pm, my phone will be basically dead by the time bars close and i wont be able to call an uber or even use google maps /maps to walk back to an apt or my house. every time the screen is on the phone loses more than one percent per minute, even as the battery manager says it has hours left.  i heard great things about the phone and battery life in particular and i know that it may be due to the fact that its refurbished or but its so distracting and such an inconvenience that i dont think it can be honestly used in a day-to-day environment. i have just contacted the company responsible and will amend my review if the issue can be quickly and adequately resolved.
just got ""new"" phone and the battery is already dead after 4 hours the next day!
product came with it defalted to chinese. hard to reset to english
the phone came in great shape with no blemishes.  however, the charger plug or cord did not work.  i would buy this again.
nice phone work great
im super happy w the phone but the battery life is half what my s5 lasted
excellent product and don't have any scratches.
looks and works like new
totally impressed! completely happy with my phone.
i use it every day
awesome phones even for them the refurbished one was brand new
great phone, easy wireless charging, nice battery life
phone is like new with all accessories.
the phone came with a screen that was burned. worked fine but this isn't what i paid for.
no comment
phone was not unlocked and phone was not a verizon wireless phone.
excellent
love this phone
ok
it works good.
good product fast service
this phone is great! looks just like new!!
phone was pristine, exactly what i wanted
everything on tht phone was good just the speaker is crappy cuz it was built on tht bottom
its gold ?
works great
i wanted to give it a little time before reviewing this to make sure everything worked properly. i'm about 3 weeks in and everything is great. it came with a charger, in a discreet brown box. the phone itself runs like brand new. at first i was concerned about the quality of a refurbished phone, but those anxieties have been laid to rest and i will certainly buy refurbished in the future to avoid increasing my monthly bill.
dislike
phone arrived on time with no defects and was easy to hook up to my already existing verizon account.only issue was that there is a little tool needed to open the sim card tray that normally comes with the phone but was not included here. however, i was able to open the tray myself with a safety pin after a bit of fidgeting so this won't be too much of an issue.
prompt service. good product.
awesome!
great product.  absolutely no problems. and the service was quick as promised.
worked great but then stopped charging after 5 months.
se puede bloquear el celular... aunque pierda el cel...
all ok! great!
yeah it looks great...but the battery is completely shot, doesn't even last 2 hours! now i have to either return it or have the battery replaced which in a galaxy s7 isn't exactly easy...i knew this was too good to be true.
received package today.. opened box to find the charger, the usb and no phone... extremely disappointed
four stars since the first one was very defective out of the box. it would reboot every few minutes. they obviously do not check these phones very thoroughly. they were both in perfect cosmetic shape.  the phone its self is a great phone. good feel, weight etc. the screen is amazing and the camera is far better than my 5s was in low light. the only negative for me was the removal of the ir emitter. i used that a lot on my 5s.
it's great phone with more features and possibilities than i need. in great shape, looked pretty much new excepting a couple minor scratches on the back.biggest beefs are that the battery life is less than expected and it gets crazy hot when using the gps with the screen on.
great ui, design, and camera. unfortunately the top speaker crackles if the volume is turned up too high. i suppose it's part of the risk of buying refurbished electronics.
phone came in near perfect condition, no scratches on the glass or dents on the metal.  came with fast charger, headphones, micro usb to usb adapter, and sim card tool.  it's an amazing product and it works great.  the battery lasts me all day for normal use or 6-8 hours of streaming video. i purchased my phone from edge cellular.
worked flawlessly. great buy. great price.
works like a charm.  no problems.  looked like it was brand new. had to go to verizon store to get the free sim and activation and no issues there either.
the refurbished galaxy s7 phone i purchased from buyspry looked and performed like new with no cosmetic defects at all. i received the phone 4 days after ordering and the seller sent a follow up email the day after delivery to make sure i was happy. took it to verizon the same afternoon i received it and verizon activated it with no problems. battery life is great.  it took 22 minutes to download my contacts, pictures, and apps from an older model galaxy phone. i used quite a lot of google searches to help me customize the phone the way i wanted. i love this phone. i looked at an s8, but for my needs, the few extra, and much more expensive,  bells and whistles weren't worth it.
same quality at lower price? i thought it is case by case, but i got a bad one. my phone signal getting weaker and weaker and now i cannot receive any call inside of building.
biggest pile of junk. does not like to read sun cards for verizon, when it does it only works for 5 minutes. constantly turns off and resets itself.
not even a scratch to show it was a refurbished model. it works very well, and is much better than my older phone.
phone arrived in 3 days, everything was great.  more than satisfied!
i received a us cellular phone instead of verizon. really disappointing.
so much better than my s4; the reduced power consumption feature is a real plus.
good product , good price
just what i wanted
the phone arrived in perfect condition, without any signs of use. i'm really happy about taking this chance so far.i'm knocking off one star because the ""relevant accessory"" wall plug charger it came with does not support samsung's fast charge - it's labeled as supporting 2v at 5a only. the original samsung charger supports variable voltage/amperage combinations up to 15 watts. it's not a huge deal compared with the savings over buying the phone new or even getting refurbs from verizon. i ordered a quickcharge-compatible wall plug by aukey on amazon for 15 bucks. it's also possible that other sellers may include a fast charger.
came as stated.
phone was in good condition and shipping was good. i broke the screen and when i had it repaired it was discovered to have been repaired previously with a non ome screen. very disappointing considering the comment for the phone said it was new.
supposed to be in brand new condition and i received a phone with a big chip in the home button. returned.
not a bad phone, however mine seems to slow down at times.
very happy with product and great customer service.
good
i had to send the phone back because every time i was making a phone call it would lose internet connection i use my phone to travel so i cant have problems like that.
this phone is not unlocked and will not work on the sprint, boost, or virgin mobile networks. very dispointed with that. overall, the phone works great, came in great condition, but the not unlocked this is a bummer.
in fact it looks well it has all the same but it does not serve the calls never who comes in the internet never wants to grab it, if you think it better buy one that if it is original because it is in only one copy and for that reason it does not work
will ir work in argentina??
product & price were great. response by tech support was slow.
best phone
i had a verizon lg g4 on straight talk and i loved it. however, it finally succumbed to the dreaded boot loop effect that lg is currently being sued for. i was looking at a v20 from lg but i read that it, too, was part of the class action law suit and as far as a refurbished g6 for about $40 more, well, sorry, lg, but you've pissed me off now.i started looking at alternatives, and it came down to the htc 10 or a refurbished samsung galaxy s7. after much searching and reading reviews, i settled on the s7. there were several vendors offering them, and i went with dealfisher because they had the ""fulfillment by amazon warehouse"" label. amazon is pretty picky, so i figured they'd be held to a higher standard than these other 3rd party vendors. i paid an extra $8 for next-day shipping.package arrived on time, in a generic box with an aftermarket charger and usb cable. the phone itself was in excellent condition for a refurbished model. there are 3 small, very light scratches on the otherwise flawless glass on the front. i didn't notice them when i first got the phone, so it could be a result of sitting in my pocket with my keys (screen protector is on the way). there are signs of wear on the plastic bezel around the camera lens, and whatever it is that covers the flash and ir sensor (i read it's some kind of polyurethane coating and shows scratches easily but doesn't effect the functionality) has several marks on it. everything else on the phone looks brand new. i'm using a supcase case for it and it fits perfectly.as far as the phone itself, i really like it. fast and smooth, camera is very good, low-light shots are the best i've ever seen on a phone. the screen quality is amazing. i like watching 4k videos on youtube just so i can bask in the s7's pixel density goodness! it's eye-candy.i like the size, it's not too big and not too small. bluetooth works well and pairs with my devices just fine. audio sounds good and is plenty loud enough, in both earphones and speaker. one thing that irked me about the g4 was no native flac support. the s7 plays them just fine with no need for a 3rd party paid-for app like poweramp. update: does not play m4a audio files, so back to poweramp.my g4 had a pretty finicky battery that would rarely get me through the day. the s7 seems to be much better in this regard. also, the g4's lock screen would randomly come on all the time, and i don't have that issue at all with the s7 (i disabled the always on display feature).my g4 never received updates and it irked the crap out of me. i guess it had something to do with being a verizon phone using a straight talk sim card. one thing i had to do with the s7 was to get a new sim card, since it uses a nanosim, not a microsim. surprisingly, upon connecting to the verizon network it showed an update available and now i have android 7.0 on my new s7.time will tell just how durable this refurbished model is. if anything goes wrong, i'll update my review.bottom line: for just over $230, it's a very nice deal for what is still a great phone that doesn't seem dated to me at all. i like it.
if you get what you ordered, this is a really nifty phone.  when i decided to upgrade from my 2.5-year-old galaxy core prime, i researched samsung's flagships back to the s4, and decided the s7 is where they finally got all the changes right.  great screen, camera, plenty of memory plus expansion slot, runs android 7, and oodles of options, settings, and customization.  the fingerprint unlock is a nice feature.  to me, this phone is also the perfect size, and will still fit in a normal pocket.only cons so far: finding a screen protector that fits may be difficult, and the notification led is smaller and dimmer than i am used to, making it hard to notice from a distance.it took me two tries to get the proper phone, however.  there are numerous third-party vendors all selling under this same product description, and i surmise there may be some tension as to what counts as a ""refurbished"" item.  the product description seems to indicate minor defects are acceptable.  amazon's definition seems to indicate it should be repaired, cleaned, and essentially remanufactured to original, like-new specs.  now, i have purchased refurbished on amazon before with great results: a couple samsung wifi cams that were as good as new, and a dslr, refurbished by nikon usa itself, that was stunningly immaculate.  alas, the first phone i received did not meet that standard, and was more what i would consider used but decently well taken care of (light glass scratches, dirt/corrosion in speaker and microphone ports).  it was also the wrong model, g930u instead of v, and had an esn that verizon could not recognize and activate.  no sim card for me!  that last bit, of course, was the deal-breaker.luckily, i had selected an amazon-fulfilled item, so return and refund was of course fast and painless.  i repurchased from a different seller, also amazon-fulfilled, and the only one who could deliver before the weekend.  i then timely received a pristine s7 that truly exemplifies what i would call refurbished or remanufactured, and am most pleased.  the short extra wait to get it totally right was well worth it.
arrived fairly quickly. so far, so good.
very happy to finally order a phone that is really unlocked and functional, as advertized!
phone working fine
completely satisfied. arrived on time & just like brand new! no complaints 😃
doesnt come with a sim card!!! and obviously doesnt go through straightalk.
i bought two of these refurbished galaxy s7's.  i've only had them less than a week.  my wife's appears to be working well, but mine hangs up and needs a system reset several times a day.  this happens when it is idle for a length of time - several hours.  seems ok if it is on a charger, but if left overnight off the charger it is unresponsive in the morning and needs the system reset.  when it comes on it still had battery life two nights, but the battery was at 0% another night.  sometimes it hangs up during the day after being idle a few hours, even with a nearly fully charged battery.  looks like i'll have to send mine back.also, i have a hard time typing on that touchscreen keyboard - seems i have to backspace once for every 2-3 characters i try to type.  but in fairness, my grandkids seem to have far less difficulty.  maybe i'll get accustom to it.update:  the day i wrote that review, i arranged to return the bad phone and buy a new one.  but i did not send it back right away.  that was about a week ago and i haven't experienced the problem since.  the s7 had required a couple system updates - perhaps they fixed the problem.  i've decided to retain the phone since then.  i'll leave the score as is.
the battery in this phone is incredibly weak.shouldn't a refurbished phone come with a new battery?don't waste your money!
i bought this phone and after getting it activated three days later took it off the charger and set it down and looked at it two hours later and the screen  messed up and i can't even use it it looks like black ink under my screen
i actually bought an unlocked s9 from this group and it works great. got a 20% off amazon like one day thing, so it was very cheap and that was why i did it but in thrall of all the hype. but, i had to give up my s7 i had gotten from verizon for about six months to my wife as her old s5 finally bought the dust.i gotta tell you i really loved the s7 having come from an s5 back in august of 2018. essentially, an s7 is an s5 on steroids with a better os updated to oreo in like october 2018 so recent.  the s7 is all about substance over form. the s7 in some ways is the last of the purely functional phones with a hard button. samsung reached a peak with this phone. they essentially fixed all the ""issues"" they had with the s5 (plastic) and s6 (glitchy not polished ideas) and created a nice looking decent phone with a good camera, water resistance and a fast chip inside.  ever since, for the s8 and s9 all they did was make em prettier and faster with bells and whistles.  the glass backs on the s8's and 9's are just another thing waiting to break. you better get a good case. they are slick in your hand too. but that screen is nice i must admit, but it is obvious that the new phones are all about form first substance second. it must be prettier and more flashy and oh by the way, it is very fast.but we are talking about the s7 and it is a very good phone for the average user who isn't going to play shooter games and doesn't need the latest, greatest and flashy. the s7 is not slow.  it s a highly functional phone that is water resistant (ip68), pretty darn fast built like a tank (metal), with unconnected fast charging and with a very decent camera. i loved it. i love its size in a hand. it fits perfectly in pockets whereas the s9 is long.  not a biggie..until you bend over in jeans. and i am not too sure i am totally sold on these curved front glass on the s8's and s9's. i have already cracked one tempered glass screen protector because of the little pretty curved glass front. i never had a problem on my s5 or the s7. apparently, this is common. the s7 is a little solid brick (still pretty) has a nice solid protective metal bezel and back and with a screen protector is good to go always. i have lately picked the old s7 up off the charger and noticed right away how comfortable it was in my hand remembering it fondly. the s9 is a great phone, but i miss the s7's pure functionality as a practical necessary device that ""fit"" in so many ways.  i may try to see if the significant other will trade me. she does like that lilac back on the s9...so, i promise you if you are an android person over 50 and just want a nice functional fast reliable phone that still looks good without a case, go with one of these and save yourself around 500 bucks. you won't regret it.
shipped quickly, phone is fully functional
this phone locks up (unresponsive) far more than my galaxy s5 ever did. it seems to do it at the most inconvenient times too like when i am trying to use the camera....the camera is great and i love the features but i could never use the phone as my go to camera for the lag reasons.or take today, i missed 2 incoming calls (it never even showed incoming) and then when i tried to call vm the phone basically locked up. i was finally able to respond to a text but this thing lags even when typing!even after i rebooted...which sometimes takes 90 seconds for me to initiate when it gets into lag more, it was slow after the reboot!it's unreal. i think this is my last galaxy.
the phone looks perfect. it came with an off brand charger that does not seem to charge it, but that is not a big deal to me, as i have chargers that do work.  this did not come with ear buds either, which is also not a big deal to me but may be for someone else.  it took a full week to get delivered which took way to long.  amazon has rarely taken that long.  once i finally received this phone, i did the smart switch from my samsung s5 to this s7. that was easy and worked perfectly.  i got everything set up and it all worked great.  so i finally switched my sim card and ready to make calls.  that's when everyone i talked to on the phone said they had a hard time hearing me.  they can't hear during the call unless i use the speaker phone.  since it's not always feasible or appropriate to be on speaker this is a huge issue. calling amazon tech support i was told to install any updates or reset the phone to factory settings.  neither of those things worked.  with regret, i will have to find another option.
phone showed up on time looked great until i powers it on. the screen only updated the left side when selecting options the right side kept going black.  just ordered another one will be sending first one back.
the samsung s7 is great! after my note 5 took a bath and quit..i replaced with samsung j7 both are great phones and very similar with the exception of the cameras.  the j7 while nice, didn't have the camera as the note 5.i opted to try a refurbished samsung s7. you would never know it wasn't brand new.  for less than $270 i've got a flagship handset, with an incredible camera and expandable storage. i highly recommend expandable storage if you enjoy taking pictures and loading mp3 files.i often drop my phone and rougher than most...so i couldn't justify the cost of an s8 or the newer s9 model phone. i'm very happy with the s7 and glad i took a chance on a refurbished item.
i give the product 5 stars, but the delivery was all over the place.  it finally arrived a couple of days late.  who knows what happened, but the package arrived in excellent condition, so the extra routing did it no harm.  the cell phone is like brand new.  it is a beautiful phone and my wife loves it.  in fact, after a few days of use, we like it so much i ordered one for myself.  and guess what?  it to has gotten lose in route, can you believe it?  i keep getting apologies for the lateness and when i track it it seems to be zigging and zagging its way to my address.  never had this problem before when ordering prime from amazon, weird.  i do not mind it come days late if it is in the same condition as the phone my wife received.  i would buy it again.  i liked the s8 and s9 but the roll over screen appears to be too sensitive for me.  my kids have these and you cannot pick it up without setting something off.  this s7 can be bought in the edge model but i prefer the standard screen.  the fact it is water proof (? resistant) and dust proof is a plus.update:  i liked this phone so much i ordered on for myself.  and guess what?  it too seemed to have gotten lost en-route.  when i did received it the packaging was fine, just a late delivery.  also, i had assumed this was a factory refurbished, like the one i bought for my wife, but it came in a different product package and without the refurb. stickers.  the phone looks like new but has a warning on the inside saying that it only has a 60 day return warranty, as opposed to the 90 day warranty of the cert. refurb. models?  so far the phone is working flawless and is like new -- i would guess it is actually a new phone, except it came with a nokia charge cable, and a small transformer charger that is not from samsung.  i have found a flaw, the headphone plug is crap.  you have to hold the plug in with pressure or it will not work.  for me?  i don't care about that because i never use headphones.  everything else looks like new.  i have marked my calendar for the 60 trial, because that is what it is, for me.  both of these phones came through amazon prime and say the supplier is samsung, so i am assuming they both came from the same distributor, but the difference in packaging says otherwise?  we will see.
perfect.  came two days early ,  no problems
phone works and looks just like new
great value for a great phone!
i have owned a lot of phones throughout the years and this is the worst phone i have ever owned, period ! i have mostly owned motorola phones up until my nearly new moto z play was accidentally submerged at the lake while putting my new boat in at the dock. at that point i decided i needed a phone that was water proof and this was suggested by a sales person at my local verizon store. i currently owned a 10"" galaxy tablet and it was ok so didn't think twice about buying a samsung phone. well, it was a huge mistake and i noticed almost from the beginning how short the battery life was and also how slow and sluggish the phone seemed to be compared to my moto z. at first it was tolerable but it just seemed to get worse, slower and more sluggish and the battery life after only a year is at a point to where i can barley make it through a full day a work and i find my self having to plug the phone in throughout the day just to get by. i did go through some steps on google to try and speed the phone up and free up resources but this only helped a little and the battery life is just a deal breaker. the other issue is the phone is so damn fragile, i dropped it for the first time the other day, and even in a protective case the back completely shattered. i dropped my preious model motorola phones countless times and other than a slight mark or blemish the phones were absolutely fine. so after only a little more than a year of use,  i now find myself needing to purchase a new phone due to its less horrible battery life, glass-jaw like build quality and piss poor performance and it will certainly not be another samsung !!!
very disappointed in the customer service. phone battery started failing, and they say the only thing they can do for me is have me ship the phone back to them for a repair. so now if i want the phone fixed i have to go buy another phone otherwise i am a couple weeks without a phone.
very happy with this purchases. we updated from our s5's to these s7's and was very impressed with the quality and new lool including the packaging. much faster than the s5's and takes very nice photos. picked up the sim chips directly from verizon for only $20.
acceptable, given the exorbitant price of smartphones.
delivered as expected a few blemishes to be expected as it was used but i love it!
item works perfect as described....
love it!
it's a solid phone in very excellent condition, and the price was great.it's still pretty tied to verizon - you have to do quite a bit of manual setup to get it to work properly with other carriers (i had to call t-mobile to have them reset some settings). i also get some annoying notifications about the sim card not being from verizon when i restart the phone.
the galaxy s7 and s7 edge have a common defect where the rear camera glass cover will spontaneously shatter. there are quite a few reported cases of this online, and samsung is as of yet not acknowledging it as a manufacturing defect. because of the design of the galaxy s7, it is virtually impossible to repair this yourself, and in order to have it fixed you have to go without a phone for over a week after shipping the phone to samsung, paying them to repair it, and waiting for them to ship it back. in my case the rear camera glass cover shattered while sitting on my desk, and there are numerous other reports of similar events (as crazy as that sounds). samsung support is unhelpful and denies that this issue has been previously reported, despite evidence to the contrary.
i decided to try something new for a change and purchased a samsung galaxy s7. it took me awhile to get used to the new software of an android phone and all the features that the s7 has to offer. i found the s7 to be overly complicated and it took me a lot longer to complete my endeavors with the s7 compared to an iphone. in addition, i have found my galaxy s7 has constantly froze and forces me to close applications. in my opinion, i think that iphone is better than galaxy because of the simplicity that iphone offers.
everything claims that this phone will work with verizon, the description, the shipping report, everything. however, when it arrived, the phone was an at&t network phone, not verizon.
wasnt what i wanted bc my son wanted the edge. it had a few small nicks on the outside frame.  no problem w return.
the screen is too sensitive. makes it impossible to browse without clicking into sites you don't want to go to. there is no way to turn it low enough. the pointer speed all the way down did not help.
keep in mind that i only got the phone today so this review doesnt cover long term issues.condition: it looks new and has no damage what so ever. now it might not have the shine or feel of a new phone, but i put it under strong light looking for any signs of damage and i found none. touch screen is perfect and all the buttons work. i'm a little worried that the home button might fail in time (it does feel a little weird) but for now its responsive so no complaints. the phone also has a verizon logo at the back.packaging and delivery: i dont have prime. i ordered this on monday afternoon and i got it on saturday. not bad. the shipping box had the protective air bubbles and all. the phone does not come with the original packaging. as the case with most refurbished products it comes in a generic box. it had a changer and a short usb cable but no headphones (bummer). it also doesnt have the user manual but who reads that.the phone takes a nano sim and i micro sd. i had to replace my sim at the verizon store and they added me to the network no problem. i'm not sure if this phone works with other networks but it does have setup guide for non-verizon carrier. the battery doesnt seem as bad as some reviews are saying, but then again i've had my s5 for almost 3 years so anything will feel like an upgrade.
the screen has lots of minor abrasions which make it extremely prone to retaining many fingerprints and oils. the earpiece is all scratched up (the black paint is chipping off of it a lot), and the home button has a big chunk taken out of the middle of it.  the corners are also pretty dinged up and the charging port is filthy as though it wasn't ever cleaned out with alcohol as it should have been - i cleaned the charging port myself when the phone failed to charge at first.  cleaning it did the trick.  the power button is finicky and doesn't always function on the first press.  the microphone and speaker holes are also somewhat dirty right out of the box.  the phone still functions just fine aside from these points, however, and it seems to still have its waterproof properties.  the sim card tray is perfectly intact as it should be, and there are no scratches in front of any of the cameras, luckily.  the last owner of this phone certainly didn't go out of their way to keep it clean or take care of it with a protective case or even a screen protector.  adding a screen protector does help with the scratches that are all over the screen, at least.  you get what you pay for i guess, but i am mostly happy with the phone so far simply because it is surely an upgrade from the s6 that i had before this.
i have been a blackberry person for over 20 years. one of my first cell phones was a blackberry. my husband checked me for a temperature when i ordered this samsung galaxy s7. so, i love it!!!! i have had very little trouble getting use to the the new icons. the phone works so similar to my samsung tablet that i really did not have any trouble converting. phone was in excellent, like new shape and ported right over to my verizon plan. i had to do a couple hours of download on os updates about a week after i began using it, but went to verizon store and used their data, saving mine for my stuff.  the size is excellent for me to carry. the features are clear and easy to use. the price was great!! delivery was as stated. totally satisfied!
caveat: i got this as an upgrade from my first phone, which was old and not the best quality to start with. so i might be a little off perspective about some things.that said, i love this thing. migrating my information and accounts was really easy, as was dropping the stuff i didn't want. the keyboard is much more precise than my old one. it is much easier to read the screen than my old one, especially for extended periods (i like ebooks). the screen adjusts to ambient light conditions, which is a great. the screens are pretty self-explanatory, and the icons are easy to see. i am still working out some of the differences with services between this and my old one (which wasn't a samsung), and i don't like any of the default ringtones, but overall i love it!
it looked like a good deal until i tried to get it to connect to verizon,  come to find out is wasn't a verizon phone,  had to send it back (i paid shipping),  bought a brand new one on ebay cheaper, no tax,  that one was defective, had to finally send it back,  i am using my old s5, bought a new case, makes me think it is new,  oh well i had a black cloud flying over me that week.
i ordered two of these certified refurbished  phones. one was great: in really good shape and worked perfectly, the othe one same shape but the microphone  didn't  work. we have sent it back for a replacement. it has not arrived yet so we don't  know  if  there are any problems with it.
works as spec.  battery life is as new. updated immediately to android 7.0 when first started.  i just plugged in my sim card from my old galaxy  s7 edge (i prefer the s7 by the way) - et voila!
great phone. works on at&t. quality refurbish.
needed a charging port replaced. intermittent wired charging. too bad..... nice phone otherwise.
this is a great upgrade from my galaxy s5 - it is so much faster even with little things like connecting to my bluetooth headset. i was a little hesitant to purchase the verizon model (g930v) since i am an at&t customer. i was told in the at&t store when i had to activate the new sim card that since it's a cdma device that it would be stuck on the ""h"" (hospitality) speed network which would not be lte but would be on 3g speeds. the mobile network will sometimes switch over to h or 3g, but it does stay on 4glte most of the time - i'm just using the normal at&t apn settings. i just tested and got 43mbps down and 9mbps up on the mobile network - this is definitely not 3g speed. :) i still need to work through a voicemail issue, though.also, the device came to me in what appears to be like new condition. there was a small scuff on the top of the phone, but the screen seems pretty much flawless.
piece of crap, battery life is terrible. the whole curved edge screen (not even the s7 edge) makes the phone buggy. as soon as i can i'll be switching to another brand or the iphone.
the phone wasn't unlocked and after taking it to 3 different stores none of them could get it working.
i bought a new galaxy s7 from verizon only to have it not charge after 6 months.  will be last samsung i buy.
i love my s7. i cracked the screen on my old one and i was told i could trade it in for an s8 but instead i purchased another s7. i will be sad when i actually have to give up my s7 for something else.the shipping was quick and the packaging was fine.i will say that the battery life on my phone was so short that i was charging it 4 times a day. i purchased a replacement battery and replaced it myself. it was a little tricky but worth it because i love this phone.the camera on this phone is great. i take tons of photos! i have yet to run out of room. i also use my phone to record videos and it's fine!
i'm giving 5 stars. the product is exactly what it was described to be. it works awesome. i've had no issues this far with one exception. phone kept prompting to have software update. i tried to update from phone several times with no success so instead i used my pc which as long as it works then that's all that matters. the phone came in 2 days early which was awesome! i have purchased several phones online and this is by far one of the better ones.
i was a little concerned about buying a refurbished cell phone but decided to take a chance. it looked new out of the box and has been working like new as well. there seems to be a wide range of reviews on these phones. i think it depends on who you buy them from. the issue i have when reading reviews is that is the one thing nobody mentions in most cases. mine was purchased from buyspry. it has been an excellent phone so far and i am glad i went with a refurbished phone now.
went to verizon for some troubleshooting and was told this device belong to another account. even after taking the box i got it with, was told they couldn't help me. had to buy another phone.
purchased this because the description states: ""samsung galaxy s7 g930v 32gb verizon wireless"". verizon could not activate this phone because it is not a verizon phone. phone came in a box with only the charger and phone. outside on the box it states ""samsung galaxy s7 g930 32g verizon/unlocked black"".  returning for a full refund.
could see only one tiny scratch. otherwise, the phone looks brand new. battery life is so-so, but that might just be from adding apps and playing with the phone. in typical samsung fashion, the screen is very sensitive to touch. annoying, but not a big deal. i added a screen protector that seemed to help.  i've only had the phone for a couple of weeks, but hopefully i'll continue to be happy with my purchase.
received 3 different phones before the one i have right now, they have great, easy, and fast customer service, everything went fine with a few replacements. convinced the phone doesn't have a oem battery, it discharges very quick.
the phone works very well. i love the camera and the photo editing features. the blue light reduction feature is great as well. the touch screen can be slow and sometimes the words that came up while typing can be very off, but overall i really like my new phone.
i bought the s7 refurbished to replace an older cell phone of mine. prior to this purchase, i had only purchased new cell phones directly from verizon, so i was nervous. well, the phone worked so well and was so easy to set up that i came back and purchased a second one for another family member. the first one shipped from buysrry and the second one from kiss electronics, but it did not make a difference as both were identical, quality products.
my son's galaxy s7 screen went dead the last time he dropped it. we bought the same phone from this company and we stuck in his sim card and sd card and its worked like a dream. its a certified refurbished but looks and acts like brand new. it was fast shipping too! thanks!!
i received mine from dealfisher a few months ago. the battery seems to hold up well and everything has been in good working order. the home button is likely aftermarket and a little ""clickier"" than it would be from a new phone, and the fingerprint scanner isn't quite as consistent with it  as i'd expect (less so than it was with my s6). overall it was very much worth it to buy refurbished.
after reading the negative reviews mixed with some positive ones, i figured it would be a gamble purchasing this refurbished phone. well, i lost that wager. phone went from 100% battery to 34% in 2 hours, with very limited use. tried removing unnecessary apps, dimming the screen, and turning off the ""always on"" screen setting, but nothing helped. ended up just purchasing a new phone from verizon.
the galaxy s7 is still an amazing phone - even two years after it's initial release. i bought this phone solely for the purpose of capturing 1080p and 4k video with the osmo mobile 2 that allows me to walk while recording and get extremely stable footage.
for the price this phone is awesome. replaced my s5 that had become a complete mess. this phone is fast, long battery life and no visible wear. also came with a real fast charger and an adapter so i could easily connect phones and transfer all my info over. love it so far!
it's holding up okay so far. brought it to a verizon shop and got it set up easily. two complaints about the s7: the charge port still sucks (cords don't fit/ break and probs with moisture getting in) and no memory card.
works as good as the original we bought through the vzw retailer so far (4 months). had to call verizon and have them re-add visual voicemail because the phone didn't automatically sync when we had it synced with the old phone number (from the phone it replaced.)
i received this phone as an upgrade to my old samsung s5.  i am so pleased with the build and quality of this phone - it has all the features i need plus more that i don't.  ;)  i mainly use it for texting and checking my social media.  camera has some great features and pictures are great.  i'm super happy i have this new phone!  for being a re-conditioned phone there was not a mark on it - it looks brand new.
so fare so good!  i'll report back after a year if i have any problems.
fully charged the phone prior to use. less than 4 hours later phone was down to 15%. eighth continued use seems to be losing 20% every hour on the optimized battery setting.the phone took 4 updates in order to work properly.  i'm not sure if that is common but i've not experienced it with other refurbished phones.
i could not be happier with this product.  it was the perfect replacement for a phone that i really liked but accidently destroyed.  it was delivered quickly and i had no problem quickly and easily transferring from my old phone to this one. it is continues to consistently perform very well.
received a g930u instead of the g930v advertised.  was able to make it work, but not what i wanted.
this is one of the best samsung phones to date. i have had multiple galaxy phones over the years and this was a jump from the s5 to the s7. multiple screen ability, great battery life, wireless charging and ease of use make it my favorite phone so far.
the phone was exactly as described, maybe even better. there wasn't a scratch anywhere. the phone has been working with no issues not for more than 2 weeks.
small dent in upper right corner. samsung s7
the worst phone ive ever had, keyboard is almost impossible to use. most text require sending twice..crashes when i take pictures, takes hours to charge.
phone looks brand new and works like new,great value
no damage to the phone work well for 3 day and the screen went black hear sound have blue led light but no  screen display i call the 1800 number grate customer serves sending me a return box
like new and i love it.  such a good price vs new.
the only thing i am very disappointed in is that for some reason the hd video and voice calling was disabled on the back end of the phone and i cannot access the internet while i am on a phone call. very frustrating!!
mine works years later, six stars
everything work perfect .......  very happy with phone !
per verizon rep: ""phone is coming up on a suspended status for a contract account. in this case it is possible that the vendor received this phone from a person that did not fulfilled their contract."" nope! avoid it.
nice updates to the 6. battery life still a nuisance.
i loved the phone but it didn't make it a year before i had too spend to fix it. i've been having issues since including overheating to the point it burns. avoid the seller.
phone seems to be in near perfect condition but i received a 4gb phone instead of 32 gb
very happy with the phone at this point for what i payed for it. the battery life does suck but not a bad phone over all.
i like the phone, good battery, quick to charge, my only issue is that the screen that was put into this refurbished device has screen burn in.
i received the phone on time and it was as advertised. i'm usually skeptical of refurbished phone batteries but i have had no problems.
i will literally spend 7 hours of my day trying to get my phone to 100%. i then use my phone for 30 minutes and i'm already back down to 40%. total crap.
rec'd samsung s7 ...refurbished. .everything so far seems fine with the exception of speaker phone. big disappointment. ..have had it less than 30 days so can't speak to the longevity yet. 3 stars only b\cuz of speakerphone.
for me i love this size phone, goldy locks...just right. best sam phone in the last 5 years, bar none. battery life could be better but it meets my needs.
battery life on this phone isn't even close to 80% of original. constantly having to charge it with light use.
plugged in my verizon sim card and started right up. looked like new. no problems so far.
looks good and works, didn't get the ear buds other people got but also didn't expect them. came with a fast charger branded by samsung. would give 5 stars but they actually called me and asked to leave a review  while i was at work.
perfect working order. minus a small blemish on the back of the phone, which doesn't effect its operation in any way, this product is flawless.
scratched to pieces on screen and the back as well as the charger port and i think something is wrong with the port....
worked fine on the verizon network after i installed my sim card.  also it appeared to be in perfect condition with no scratches or blemishes.
good deal, solid refurb
exactly as described. working perfectly.
we have only had our new phone for a few weeks, but up until this point we are happy with the purchase. super fast shipping was appreciated.
great phone, not an s9 but great. you can get the oreo update for it now too.
this my only phone now and it has been working perfectly.
want to be able to switch carriers att t-mobile etc.  this is no a good phone for that. the cdma setting does not work on other networks.  good mostly on verizon.  don’t buy to switch to anyone else. unlocked does not matter
i ordered from electronic deals. the first one received, wouldn't connect when i put in the sim card. contacted the seller, and they were great. sent back the cell with the overnight postage covered by them.  recieved another soon after.  works great! love it. battery isn't as good as i hoped,  but better than my old one and charges fast with the fast charger i have. just bought wireless charger and can't wait to recieved it! highly recommend the seller electronic deals!
love it.  had an s5 but was having battery and display issues.  this was a nice upgrade.  i don't need all the bells and whistles of the latest models and the price for this was certainly right.  i have bought refurbished phones before with no issues and there certainly have been none with this one.  the sim card is a different size so i couldn't just swap in the one from my s5, but i got one for free from verizon (took some convincing, however, verizon store personnel didn't seem to know that they were allowed to give me one without the phone in hand).
great phone! had it for a few days now! everything is great, got it on time. came with a lighting charger. still waiting on a sim card in the mail to know if the phone works when activatedupdate: had the phone for a while now and my data stopped working so i restarted the phone and i won’t turn back on it just vibrates/ had it on the charger for maybe an hour and still won’t come on. i looked it up and it’s common for this phone. it was great until i restarted it :(
the phone was as described, refurbished in good condition. we transferred a sim card and had no problem activating the phone on our verizon account. the seller provided warranty and contact information in the box. my son is very pleased with his new phone.
i had a rewarding experience with this purchase. i would recommend it. my order came as describe and for the price .i had a great deal. the phone was in a great shipping package and shipment was really fast. thank you so much and will recommend you to family and friends.
had a faulty charger but had it replaced with no problems
i have had this phone since august and had excellent performance with no problems at all. i haven't gotten is wet so for it being waterproof  i cannot say but my old non-waterproof phone never got close to water either.it came in plain undamaged packaging with not a scratch on the phone anywhere, just like brand new.
i like the phone, however i have had the screen freeze on me 3 times now. the first time a verizon rep help me reset the phone. i have reset the phone myself the other 2 times. it took me multiple times to get it to let me in. i am worried this will keep happening. what should i do?
that i can use my waterproof fit bit with it.  that it keeps updating every day, sometimes even twice in a day.  this is my first smart phone and i am finding it hard to learn all it can do.  call me a tech dummy!  i hope that by the time i really need to use it for something that i can do it.
perfect condition. shipped with charging cord only. no manual or headphones. works great with our verizon service. so far so good!
battery life could be better, removable battery would be best
great phone.
this phone was rooted. it worked for a few days, but  it got hot to the touch, the os update kept failing. finally it locked up and would not boot.  i had to return it.  thanks for amazon.
best bang for your buck rn.... especially after the s9 just hit the market!
good phone, good battery life.
awesome phone and customer service
great display, like that you can expand the memory, havnt had any issues with this phone
the screen died right at 94 days.  just out of warranty.
the product arrived quickly and was exactly as the seller described. it's a great upgrade from an s5.
the unit battery for not hold up all day.
great item
really happy with this phone. i was a bit nervous about buying refurbished, but the phone is in pristine condition and working perfectly. i would definitely buy from this company again. thanks a lot!
the battery life is terrible on this phone, i only got 3 hours per charge. terrible waste  of money.
save your money. camera jacked up and can't play back recording.  reduced to overpriced paper weight.
very nice phone!
great exactly what i expected,  works awesome!
looks and perform brand new so far!
great quality , like new.
it took a lot of time but we got it to work with cricket. great phone!
returned didn't need
works great, liking it so far.
product was in like new condition and works well.
great phone, but the charger was fake, won t charge my phone...
lasted 4 months
great phone ordered from dealfish, would only order from them best on reviews. i was glad i did. looked brand new!!
got this phone to replace my son's samsung s5 and it's perfect!!!! would never know it's a refurbished phone. thanks!
no issues.  works well.
nice phone. has cool features and a nice display. perfect screen no scratches.
meow
did not download verizon voice mail app
was everything advertised.
this phone does not work with the verizon network
good used phone
got this phone for my husband, he is very pleased!
great product. good customer service.
great product in great condition!
excelente producto
amazing phone...it is just as good if not better than a brand new s7..... thank you guys for the speedy delivery as always
had the phone for over a month now. works perfect! was hesitant as it was refurbished, but was in great cosmetic condition and works flawlessay with verizon. completely satisfied!
the phone arrived in perfect condition, without any signs of use. and acts like it's in absolute brand new condition. my phone came with the samsung fast charger. bottom line i’m excited whit it.samsung galaxy s7 g930v , 32gb, black onyx, verizon + gsm (certified refurbished)
i received the phone in like new condition, no problems with it whatsoever.  i upgraded from an s5, so far very happy with the decision!
this was a replacement for a previous samsung and appears to be just fine.  so far so good!
excellent phone, couldn't tell it was refurbished. international shipping was a great bonus, already bought another one :)
works
easy to use love it
great phone and in nice shape!
great service. fast delivery! phone works great. highly recommended.
shipping took 8 days, not sure if that is normal but definitely a first world problem.  i have used this for two days and so far a 5 star. the first day it had to do updates 7 times before i could use it much. not sure what version it started with but is now up to 7.0. when i took it into verizon to get a sim card they said the serial number says this phone is gold, which it is not, it is black. and when i registered the device with samsung it also shows a gold phone.finger print reader is very quick and effective. samsung pay is great and quick to checkout with.phone is fast and battery life seems good. i'll update the review in a few days and weeks and let you all know how it is holding up.-------i have now used the s7 for almost 2 months.  the only item i will complain about is the speaker phone when on a phone call.  i can hear the other party great, but they have very bad feed back and tell me to turn off speaker phone.  i attempted some troubleshooting myself and then ended up calling samsung.  an hour on the phone with them and doing all sorts of weird phone restarts, cache clearing and safe mode tests, there is still no answer as to why the speaker phone does not work.  is it a physical issue or software issue?  not a clue and samsung wants me to factory reset the phone as the next step but i am not sure i want to do that yet.the camera is great.  phone is quick with all applications and the battery lasts all day long.  if you use the always on screen setting to show the time that kills the battery by at least 4 hours quicker so i don't use that anymore.because of the speakerphone issue i will knock this review down to a 4 star from a 5 star.
screen quit on last day of eligible return. close call but got full refund.
screen stopped working after 45 days
received the phone on time. the charger that came with the phone was slightly bent and also the battery on this phone sucks, it wont even last me during my entire 10 hour work shift which is very unacceptable because my phone is important for my job. haven't tried contacting the seller because i know they won't help with the battery in a refurbished phone. once i get paid again i may contact the seller or just go to a phone repair service to have a new battery put in. i will update review then
very happy with this phone.  bought it refurbished.  upgrading from the s4.  32 gb is very nice.  phone is faster.  everything worked.  had to get a new sim card from my local verizon dealer, which was easy enough.  could have cut down the card from the s4, but was easier just to get the new one.  this phone still has headphone jacks, etc., so i am happy with it.  like this size, like the speed, like the price.
very happy with my purchase.  was sceptical like everyone when deciding on a refurbished  phone but so glad i did. when i opened the box the phone was flawless and oem accessories. i am with straight talk so i also purchased the verizon nano sim from amazon since my old s4 was micro then i was ready to go. i am a very satisfied customer.  thanks
terrific phone. battery life is low side.
a phone is just a phone, made for calling and talking.  not anymore.  a cell phone is for talking, picture taking, note taking, my calendar, my appointment book, for games, news, entertainment and on and on...oh did i mention you can even make phone calls, text, send pictures and all that good stuff.  a phone like the samsung galaxy s7 is a great 21st century tool.  thanks samsung.  cc46
i was  very hesitant to purchase a refurbished phone,  but i am presently surprised on how great the condition of the phone is.  it looks brand new,  came with all factory accessories it should,  headphones charges and transfer adapter.  i obviously can't  evaluate the battery but,  i haven't had any issue with the battery and seem to be new if not in great condition.  i would definitely purchase again
this phone only had one light scratch on the back, activation at verizon was simple. battery seems fine, exceeds the duration of my former handset.i'd buy another refurb from this vendor (prime mobility)
i had the phone less than 2 weeks when the screen died. i put it in a case and put a screen protector on it within a  hour of it arriving, and never dropped it. but somehow the screen was broken.
no problems with the phone. it comes with the charger cord and ear buds. it does not come with the cord to transfer your data from old phone to new (included when purchasing a new phone). it also does not come with the little key to pop open the little compartment for internal cards--you have to use a paperclip.
works perfectly. 9.9/10 condition. no complaints at all. only works on verizon so i had to change carriers, but my fault for not reading the description carefully.
been using for almost a year, no complaints! came wiped clean and ready to go. i'll never buy a new phone again!
was a gift and looks and works excellent
phone wouldn't connect with network so sent back.
my daughter ordered this. typical cell phone.
sleek, relatively cheap. came like new. can't even tell its a used phone.
works great, thus far, downside is the good ole verizon bloatware is almost astounding, but getting it set up on ting was a piece of cake and performance is perfect once i disabled all the bloat.
this samsung galaxy s7 is great. everything works fine.i had a s5 before i bought this so  i am familiar with the workings. this is a nice upgrade to my s5. i'm happy with it.
works perfectly and exactly as it was advertised. great phone. great site to deal with!
easy to setup, packaged great looked great exactly what i expected
great deal. phone looked like new and a really nice phone. don't think i  could beat the price and quality. appreciate they stated the phone is for verizon and after verizon added the sim, worked great. got the spigen case for it. just love the phone and case.
overall, the phone is pretty good. samsung did a good job. the handset i received is a close facsimile but its obvious that when it was refurbished some lower quality parts/methods were used. the screen is plagued with under-sensitivity. it can be downright frustrating to text or try to play games on it and have to deliberately press harder to get it to respond. the under-sensitivity also causes it to be unusable even with thin gloves. the charge port is also recessed on my particular handset. this hasn't caused any issues with charging yet, but it does make using a gear vr very frustrating. for the cost vs. a new one i can live with these faults, but i'll end up trading it in for a new phone much sooner than i would have if it worked as well as it should.
it's taking a little getting used to since i upgraded from an s3, but i definitely like it.  no issues so far other than operator lack of knowledge.
great phone! works great did show some wear on the phone but not enough to be an issue. other reviewers stated they got extras with their phones which you can't expect, nor was there a fast charger with it there was just a basic charger.
just great. the phone was in perfect shape. no scratches or ds all ings.. anything. ive been using it for a couple months now and works perfectly. the only thing is that it comes with a asus charger. it does not fast charge and after the first month and some software updates, the phone did not recognize the charger anymore. but. for that price? it does not matter i got the samsung fast charger for 40 at best buy. i totally recommend this!
charging function stopped working within a week of purchase.  only could charge wireless.  would not recommend
i bought this cell phone and it completely broke at the first mild touch. send a mail to the guys and told me it was not in the warranty. i have reasons to believe these cells are not as resistant as they should be.
the phone came fast.  looked really good.  had no issues getting it on verizon plan.
nothing to say but my wife loves it enough said
love the phone. the charger that came with it does not work. not sure what to do about that.
just what i needed for a job. thanks
awesome phone but the q&a section is little misleading this phone does not work with verizon
the only two drawbacks are (1) speaker sound quality is noticeably lower than a ""new"" phone, and (2) this is with respect to the model in general -- the glass on s7's is apparently pretty delicate, and after dropping it 3 feet onto concrete (with no case), i've learned that glass cracks/repairs are expensive. (apparently the glue and other tech aspects on the s7 mean that you'll almost certainly have to replace the glass *and* lcd/digitzer. $200 at our local shop, ouch.)
for those who struggled with the horrible battery life of previous galaxy phones, finally this one is tolerable. i highly recommend the upgrade. i finally can feel safe without charging my phone multiple times a day...
do not buy this product. battery exploded.
i hate this thing. maybe i'm spoiled by the lg, but the functionality of this samsung sucks.three things that drive me nuts the most:#1. to unlock the phone from a sleep state first you have to hit the function button. then you have swipe the screen. then you have to swipe your pattern. compare this to the lg, double tap on the screen puts it to sleep, double tap wakes it up, swipe a pattern if you have one. fast and easy.#2. battery non-life. my lg i could go for a week. even when using it heavily it would last 3 days. 5-7 days if i didn't use it much. the samsung eats the battery in 2 days if not used and 1 day if it's used.  yes, you can turn on the battery saver, but then most anytime you need to do anything other than answer a call you have to turn it off. very much a pita.#3. alarm. you have to press and hold, the ""button"" (on the screen not the actual button) and then wait, and wait, and wait, and then swipe to turn it off. ld, tap once and it's done.there are more reasons i dislike this phone. most of it has to do with the fact that i've used lg most of my life and they function better and faster. if you don't know any better you might like the samsung, but i'm selling it and going back to the an lg. yes the camera is better in the s7, but the s7 is much heavier then the lg  i previously had. it's also bigger. not by a lot in terms of inches, but when i put the lg in my shirt pocket i barely knew it was there. the s7 is like a paperweight more than a phone.
i've had the phone for 6 weeks now with absolutely no issues, it came looking beautiful in a samsung box with brand new charger and headphones. super happy with this purchase!!!
first off, let me say that i don't like apple phones. i prefer android much more than ios, so all problems i have with this phone have purely to do with the phone itself, not the operating system it runs.overall, the samsung galaxy s7 is great. it's a fast phone, has a great camera, quick fingerprint scanner, super high quality screen, and just looks really, really good. but, on the contrary, there are some things i just don't like about this. so, i've made up a pros and cons list:pros* high quality screen* looks good* great camera* fast fingerprint scanner* feels comfortable in my hands* runs smooth and quick* expandable storage* durable* water proofcons* glass back* can become slow over time* occasionally gets hot* not the best battery life when compared to other popular phonesmy main problem with the galaxy s7 is the glass back. i absolutely hate it. in fact, it's the reason i don't give this phone 5 stars. let me explain why.first, the fingerprints. i absolutely hate it when my phone gets fingerprints all over it, as i'm sure many of you do too. an aluminum backing, like the iphone and google pixel use, is much better. not only does it not get those finger prints, but it also doesn't crack.i've had the glass backing on mine crack twice now. the first time  i tossed my phone and the back hit a hard piece of plastic and cracked. i got it replaced with oem glass within a week of that happening.one day, i was in class lighting leaning against a desk talking with my friends with my phone in my pocket. all of the sudden i heard a cracking noise only to pull out my phone and find the back cracked. again.so, with that said, know this phone is super good and i absolutely love it, but my issues with the glass back has been enough to make me want to switch away from samsung. i'm likely going to get a google pixel next.
had an s5 and an s7, and i have not gone back to a galaxy since breaking my s7 and do not plan on ever going back.the s7 was great in the beginning,but after about half a year or maybe less my galaxy s7 became very buggy (not uncommonly to the point where the phone would have to be restarted), a battery drainer (i am not a heavy phone user, and i keep my screen at 50% brightness at most times), and just frequently frustrating in general.also the camera is atrocious. it quickly developed a bug where i could not focus on objects within a foot of the lens for the life of me.bottom line, i would not recommend this phone to anyone! there are much much much better phones in this price bracket from companies like motorola, huawei, xiaomi, and essential to name a few.
this refurb was not the quality i expected.1. the screen had obviously never had a screen protector and was scuffed and micropitted.2. it took a long time for the battery to fully charge - 2-1/2 hours from 61%.3. when i turned it on, it was in chinese!immediately returned.
i've had several samsung galaxy phones. the gorilla glass is nice. however, i dropped it once, with a protective case on it and it cracked all the way down the back. it appears that the back glass is not as strong as the front. i'm done with samsung phones. i'm going to have to carry a cracked phone for at least a couple of years.
not my favorite phone. texting is terrible. i've typed things over and over and they are still wrong. you can be watching a video and sit the phone down and it disappears. i do not recommend.
i have had my s7 for over a year now. it runs flawlessly. i've used it for lawn care and has passed the rain and dust resistant tests. unfortunately, dropped my s7 in a few inches of snow in colorado and it only messed up the battery. will be purchasing a second s7 > any other phone out. price and quality match.
great upgrade
i would have given this product a 5 star rating but... the seller failed to include the usb adapter needed to perform the built in smart switch function for rolling over the contents of your old phone to this one. i solved this problem by ordering one here on amazon. it should be included with the phone as it is a required piece of hardware.
did not work for me.  it kept crashing.
great phone! being a refurbished phone, had a very small ding on it, otherwise perfect. i would buy again!
great phone
new condition and works without flaw
so far so good,,,,phone works great
the phone's as expected but the experience was surprisingly pleasant. no complaints here.
false advertising
battery sucks and phone over heats constantly. bought by mistake
this phone works great.  have gotten refurbished phones that did not work and had signs of water damage inside.  saw it when checking the battery.
works great!!
how refreshing to get just what i ordered!
i bought this after my s8 was stolen. sure it's waterproof is a ""smartphone"" but that's where i draw the line. somehow because it's been refurbished this just doesn't want to work properly. my snapchat app in particular just refuses to work- one app, whatever. but what's worse is that the led had a strange tint across the entire screen almost like a blue light filter (not enabled) and seemed to have an icon fade from the previous owner's layout. it also doesn't work with other settings like trying to change the ringtone- it refuses to use anything but the system default. it's been 6 months so i've given up on that by now. the charger that the phone came with? a joke. broke in 2 months. the home button seemed to ""scratch off"" so it looks like it's been chipped away. i have a very good case so unsure how this happened. i tried to contact customer service for a refund/replacement within 30 days but i guess the one woman who has to process that wasn't there that day? so after calling the next day a man tells me that he can only process a 10% refund because the led problem was a ""minor problem"" but i didn't have my order number on me so i had to call back. when i called again, the next person i needed to talk to was not there. so i gave up. it still works, but disappointed in the ""refurbishment"" skills for the price. would not buy again. buy a new motorola for the same price.  i should have gone through with the return. also the battery lasts less than 7 hrs with medium use so good luck bringing it to school/work without a charger. i think new this phone is good but refurbished is not. (side note: i've been buying samsungs my whole life).
phone was fine there were scratches all on the corners screen was intact looked good but the finger scanner didn't work so i choose to return.
(this is my second s7 i have owned) phone looks good, battery charges, stays cool, but doesn't seem to have the longevity as my other s7 phone. the charge cable appeared to be a samsung oem, charger was not oem, but quick charge capable. got a chuckle with my ""return information card"" was for how to return my refurb apple device and the steps to remove personal information.
i wish i had pictures, but you can't take pictures of your phone with your phone. it was like christmas...boxed up beautifully with the new, wrapped cord and charger. almost like a set of new earrings or jewelry on display. the little access key to make it easier to get into the phone was gummed gently to the inside of the lid, obviously to be seen for use by the purchaser. it was so nice that i can't make myself throw the orange box away. (i have a thing about saving the boxes phones come in. mental, i know.) thank you, cprtx! you really treated me very well.
thanks. looks basically new.
works like new!
totally as expected.  no complaints.  good job samsung.
i have not had a phone in about 4 years.  i was a bit trepidicious about getting a refurb.  however, this one has been just great.  battery seems to need a charge at least once every 24 hours.  i don't know if that is normal, but it is way better than my old beaten s4.
phone is fine, but the charger sent with the phone did not work for this phone since the charger was for an iphone.
very happy, battery life would be better.
been using this for awhile and have no regrets getting the refurbished. less than half the cost of a verizon replacement and has worked flawlessly for quite awhile.
this phone does not receive 4g.  it barely receives 3g where i am located and my previous s5 received 4g just fine.took it to amazon and they tried and tried and gave up.  am returning it.
so! after not getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my plain cardboard box this phone came in, i took it back to jamaica where my ""gsm unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (meaning it is not unlocked). i have bought gsm unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in jamaica, but not this one. after requesting an unlock code from at&t, only to be told that ""this device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".i want all of my money back, and i deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.
failed in less than two months. battery is losing charge fast. screen started flickering and phone started automatically deleting data without user doing anything to cause it.
this is my wife's galaxy s7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  our carrier required an unlocked gsm phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""verizon"" on the back).  the phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later i got the sim card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).after about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * that was the problem! *  once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  so.....should this happen to your s7 from kiss electronics......when you buy one of these from kiss electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  i do not know if this was kiss electronic's fault or samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been master reset.  once you get the cell, before you do anything to it, i would suggest doing the master reset just to be sure/safe.
i purchased this samsung g7 from what was touted as ""amazon's choice refurbisher"".  i thought i would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  the first problem i saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  the phone would take pictures, and i don't take lots of pictures, so i decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  i need a phone for my business, and i didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.the second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  even in the first month of using the phone, i could seldom get through a day on a charge.  i am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  i just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  i read several articles, and i went in and removed and disabled every app that i could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  i got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.the final straw is that now, in september, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  i am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old samsung g5 in order to get me by (i have to have a phone for my business), until i can order another phone.  of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.the bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" amazon phone.  find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  these phones have been returned because of a problem, and amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.
i purchased the refurbished galaxy s7 for my son's 17th birthday.  it arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  however, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the samsung phones after updating to android 8 (oreo).  we made sure the os and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by samsung to address this issue in the samsung community.  no joy! there are many posts there concerning this issue.  i hope samsung finds a fix soon.  it is otherwise a great phone.fortunately, the seller, buyspry, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  i do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.
do not bother buying one of these! they obviously do not inspect them properly if i was able to notice a very obvious screen defect withing a few hours of owning the phone! they should have caught that and never tried to pass this phone off on anyone!  the first day i got the phone i noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. i did not notice this until i already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so i figured i would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. it proved to be extremely annoying. after a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. it is infuriating because now i won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. this whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and i greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".
great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.
i had to return the phone as it wasn't actually unlocked. it was full of at&t bloatware as well. did not work with republic wireless.
i just bought that phone and it was a present to my sister and now the phone has turned out to be a nightmare.
my real rating would be about 3.75 stars if i could give that.  i used the phone for a week before writing this review.  the ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the home key and the trim at the top.  they aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so i don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  i'm also a little concerned that the usb port is worn.  it doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  so far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  i'm with at&t, moving up from an s5.  i had to get a new sim card (different size) from at&t, which the tech installed for free.  i asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a you tube.  he stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which i believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  problem was, this is an unlocked verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (i'm assuming from verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  i kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  i used samsung's ""smart switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  that worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  battery life seems good.  i'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  it took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  a nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  i got 2.5 years out of my refurbished s5, which still works although is getting quirky.  if this one lasts as long i'll have no complaints.

i purchased the refurbished galaxy s7 for my son's 17th birthday.  it arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  however, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the samsung phones after updating to android 8 (oreo).  we made sure the os and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by samsung to address this issue in the samsung community.  no joy! there are many posts there concerning this issue.  i hope samsung finds a fix soon.  it is otherwise a great phone.fortunately, the seller, buyspry, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  i do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.
do not bother buying one of these! they obviously do not inspect them properly if i was able to notice a very obvious screen defect withing a few hours of owning the phone! they should have caught that and never tried to pass this phone off on anyone!  the first day i got the phone i noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. i did not notice this until i already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so i figured i would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. it proved to be extremely annoying. after a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. it is infuriating because now i won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. this whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and i greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".
great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.
i had to return the phone as it wasn't actually unlocked. it was full of at&t bloatware as well. did not work with republic wireless.
i just bought that phone and it was a present to my sister and now the phone has turned out to be a nightmare.
my real rating would be about 3.75 stars if i could give that.  i used the phone for a week before writing this review.  the ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the home key and the trim at the top.  they aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so i don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  i'm also a little concerned that the usb port is worn.  it doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  so far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  i'm with at&t, moving up from an s5.  i had to get a new sim card (different size) from at&t, which the tech installed for free.  i asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a you tube.  he stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which i believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  problem was, this is an unlocked verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (i'm assuming from verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  i kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  i used samsung's ""smart switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  that worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  battery life seems good.  i'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  it took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  a nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  i got 2.5 years out of my refurbished s5, which still works although is getting quirky.  if this one lasts as long i'll have no complaints.
so! after not getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my plain cardboard box this phone came in, i took it back to jamaica where my ""gsm unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (meaning it is not unlocked). i have bought gsm unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in jamaica, but not this one. after requesting an unlock code from at&t, only to be told that ""this device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".i want all of my money back, and i deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.
failed in less than two months. battery is losing charge fast. screen started flickering and phone started automatically deleting data without user doing anything to cause it.

so! after not getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my plain cardboard box this phone came in, i took it back to jamaica where my ""gsm unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (meaning it is not unlocked). i have bought gsm unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in jamaica, but not this one. after requesting an unlock code from at&t, only to be told that ""this device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".i want all of my money back, and i deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.
failed in less than two months. battery is losing charge fast. screen started flickering and phone started automatically deleting data without user doing anything to cause it.
this is my wife's galaxy s7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  our carrier required an unlocked gsm phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""verizon"" on the back).  the phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later i got the sim card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).after about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * that was the problem! *  once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  so.....should this happen to your s7 from kiss electronics......when you buy one of these from kiss electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  i do not know if this was kiss electronic's fault or samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been master reset.  once you get the cell, before you do anything to it, i would suggest doing the master reset just to be sure/safe.
i purchased this samsung g7 from what was touted as ""amazon's choice refurbisher"".  i thought i would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  the first problem i saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  the phone would take pictures, and i don't take lots of pictures, so i decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  i need a phone for my business, and i didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.the second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  even in the first month of using the phone, i could seldom get through a day on a charge.  i am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  i just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  i read several articles, and i went in and removed and disabled every app that i could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  i got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.the final straw is that now, in september, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  i am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old samsung g5 in order to get me by (i have to have a phone for my business), until i can order another phone.  of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.the bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" amazon phone.  find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  these phones have been returned because of a problem, and amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.
i purchased the refurbished galaxy s7 for my son's 17th birthday.  it arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  however, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the samsung phones after updating to android 8 (oreo).  we made sure the os and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by samsung to address this issue in the samsung community.  no joy! there are many posts there concerning this issue.  i hope samsung finds a fix soon.  it is otherwise a great phone.fortunately, the seller, buyspry, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  i do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.
do not bother buying one of these! they obviously do not inspect them properly if i was able to notice a very obvious screen defect withing a few hours of owning the phone! they should have caught that and never tried to pass this phone off on anyone!  the first day i got the phone i noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. i did not notice this until i already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so i figured i would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. it proved to be extremely annoying. after a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. it is infuriating because now i won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. this whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and i greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".
great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.
i had to return the phone as it wasn't actually unlocked. it was full of at&t bloatware as well. did not work with republic wireless.

i purchased this samsung g7 from what was touted as ""amazon's choice refurbisher"".  i thought i would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  the first problem i saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  the phone would take pictures, and i don't take lots of pictures, so i decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  i need a phone for my business, and i didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.the second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  even in the first month of using the phone, i could seldom get through a day on a charge.  i am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  i just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  i read several articles, and i went in and removed and disabled every app that i could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  i got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.the final straw is that now, in september, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  i am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old samsung g5 in order to get me by (i have to have a phone for my business), until i can order another phone.  of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.the bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" amazon phone.  find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  these phones have been returned because of a problem, and amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.
i purchased the refurbished galaxy s7 for my son's 17th birthday.  it arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  however, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the samsung phones after updating to android 8 (oreo).  we made sure the os and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by samsung to address this issue in the samsung community.  no joy! there are many posts there concerning this issue.  i hope samsung finds a fix soon.  it is otherwise a great phone.fortunately, the seller, buyspry, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  i do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.
do not bother buying one of these! they obviously do not inspect them properly if i was able to notice a very obvious screen defect withing a few hours of owning the phone! they should have caught that and never tried to pass this phone off on anyone!  the first day i got the phone i noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. i did not notice this until i already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so i figured i would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. it proved to be extremely annoying. after a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. it is infuriating because now i won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. this whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and i greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".
great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.
i had to return the phone as it wasn't actually unlocked. it was full of at&t bloatware as well. did not work with republic wireless.
i just bought that phone and it was a present to my sister and now the phone has turned out to be a nightmare.
my real rating would be about 3.75 stars if i could give that.  i used the phone for a week before writing this review.  the ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the home key and the trim at the top.  they aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so i don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  i'm also a little concerned that the usb port is worn.  it doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  so far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  i'm with at&t, moving up from an s5.  i had to get a new sim card (different size) from at&t, which the tech installed for free.  i asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a you tube.  he stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which i believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  problem was, this is an unlocked verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (i'm assuming from verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  i kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  i used samsung's ""smart switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  that worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  battery life seems good.  i'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  it took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  a nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  i got 2.5 years out of my refurbished s5, which still works although is getting quirky.  if this one lasts as long i'll have no complaints.
so! after not getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my plain cardboard box this phone came in, i took it back to jamaica where my ""gsm unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (meaning it is not unlocked). i have bought gsm unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in jamaica, but not this one. after requesting an unlock code from at&t, only to be told that ""this device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".i want all of my money back, and i deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

my real rating would be about 3.75 stars if i could give that.  i used the phone for a week before writing this review.  the ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the home key and the trim at the top.  they aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so i don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  i'm also a little concerned that the usb port is worn.  it doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  so far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  i'm with at&t, moving up from an s5.  i had to get a new sim card (different size) from at&t, which the tech installed for free.  i asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a you tube.  he stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which i believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  problem was, this is an unlocked verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (i'm assuming from verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  i kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  i used samsung's ""smart switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  that worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  battery life seems good.  i'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  it took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  a nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  i got 2.5 years out of my refurbished s5, which still works although is getting quirky.  if this one lasts as long i'll have no complaints.
so! after not getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my plain cardboard box this phone came in, i took it back to jamaica where my ""gsm unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (meaning it is not unlocked). i have bought gsm unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in jamaica, but not this one. after requesting an unlock code from at&t, only to be told that ""this device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".i want all of my money back, and i deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.
failed in less than two months. battery is losing charge fast. screen started flickering and phone started automatically deleting data without user doing anything to cause it.
this is my wife's galaxy s7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  our carrier required an unlocked gsm phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""verizon"" on the back).  the phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later i got the sim card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).after about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * that was the problem! *  once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  so.....should this happen to your s7 from kiss electronics......when you buy one of these from kiss electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  i do not know if this was kiss electronic's fault or samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been master reset.  once you get the cell, before you do anything to it, i would suggest doing the master reset just to be sure/safe.
i purchased this samsung g7 from what was touted as ""amazon's choice refurbisher"".  i thought i would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  the first problem i saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  the phone would take pictures, and i don't take lots of pictures, so i decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  i need a phone for my business, and i didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.the second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  even in the first month of using the phone, i could seldom get through a day on a charge.  i am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  i just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  i read several articles, and i went in and removed and disabled every app that i could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  i got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.the final straw is that now, in september, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  i am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old samsung g5 in order to get me by (i have to have a phone for my business), until i can order another phone.  of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.the bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" amazon phone.  find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  these phones have been returned because of a problem, and amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.
i purchased the refurbished galaxy s7 for my son's 17th birthday.  it arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  however, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the samsung phones after updating to android 8 (oreo).  we made sure the os and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by samsung to address this issue in the samsung community.  no joy! there are many posts there concerning this issue.  i hope samsung finds a fix soon.  it is otherwise a great phone.fortunately, the seller, buyspry, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  i do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.
do not bother buying one of these! they obviously do not inspect them properly if i was able to notice a very obvious screen defect withing a few hours of owning the phone! they should have caught that and never tried to pass this phone off on anyone!  the first day i got the phone i noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. i did not notice this until i already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so i figured i would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. it proved to be extremely annoying. after a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. it is infuriating because now i won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. this whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and i greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".
great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.

do not bother buying one of these! they obviously do not inspect them properly if i was able to notice a very obvious screen defect withing a few hours of owning the phone! they should have caught that and never tried to pass this phone off on anyone!  the first day i got the phone i noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. i did not notice this until i already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so i figured i would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. it proved to be extremely annoying. after a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. it is infuriating because now i won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. this whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and i greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".
great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.
i had to return the phone as it wasn't actually unlocked. it was full of at&t bloatware as well. did not work with republic wireless.
i just bought that phone and it was a present to my sister and now the phone has turned out to be a nightmare.
my real rating would be about 3.75 stars if i could give that.  i used the phone for a week before writing this review.  the ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the home key and the trim at the top.  they aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so i don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  i'm also a little concerned that the usb port is worn.  it doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  so far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  i'm with at&t, moving up from an s5.  i had to get a new sim card (different size) from at&t, which the tech installed for free.  i asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a you tube.  he stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which i believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  problem was, this is an unlocked verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (i'm assuming from verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  i kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  i used samsung's ""smart switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  that worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  battery life seems good.  i'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  it took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  a nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  i got 2.5 years out of my refurbished s5, which still works although is getting quirky.  if this one lasts as long i'll have no complaints.
so! after not getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my plain cardboard box this phone came in, i took it back to jamaica where my ""gsm unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (meaning it is not unlocked). i have bought gsm unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in jamaica, but not this one. after requesting an unlock code from at&t, only to be told that ""this device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".i want all of my money back, and i deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.
failed in less than two months. battery is losing charge fast. screen started flickering and phone started automatically deleting data without user doing anything to cause it.
this is my wife's galaxy s7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  our carrier required an unlocked gsm phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""verizon"" on the back).  the phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later i got the sim card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).after about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * that was the problem! *  once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  so.....should this happen to your s7 from kiss electronics......when you buy one of these from kiss electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  i do not know if this was kiss electronic's fault or samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been master reset.  once you get the cell, before you do anything to it, i would suggest doing the master reset just to be sure/safe.

this is my wife's galaxy s7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  our carrier required an unlocked gsm phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""verizon"" on the back).  the phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later i got the sim card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).after about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * that was the problem! *  once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  so.....should this happen to your s7 from kiss electronics......when you buy one of these from kiss electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  i do not know if this was kiss electronic's fault or samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been master reset.  once you get the cell, before you do anything to it, i would suggest doing the master reset just to be sure/safe.
i purchased this samsung g7 from what was touted as ""amazon's choice refurbisher"".  i thought i would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  the first problem i saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  the phone would take pictures, and i don't take lots of pictures, so i decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  i need a phone for my business, and i didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.the second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  even in the first month of using the phone, i could seldom get through a day on a charge.  i am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  i just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  i read several articles, and i went in and removed and disabled every app that i could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  i got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.the final straw is that now, in september, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  i am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old samsung g5 in order to get me by (i have to have a phone for my business), until i can order another phone.  of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.the bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" amazon phone.  find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  these phones have been returned because of a problem, and amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.
i purchased the refurbished galaxy s7 for my son's 17th birthday.  it arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  however, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the samsung phones after updating to android 8 (oreo).  we made sure the os and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by samsung to address this issue in the samsung community.  no joy! there are many posts there concerning this issue.  i hope samsung finds a fix soon.  it is otherwise a great phone.fortunately, the seller, buyspry, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  i do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.
do not bother buying one of these! they obviously do not inspect them properly if i was able to notice a very obvious screen defect withing a few hours of owning the phone! they should have caught that and never tried to pass this phone off on anyone!  the first day i got the phone i noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. i did not notice this until i already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so i figured i would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. it proved to be extremely annoying. after a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. it is infuriating because now i won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. this whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and i greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".
great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.
i had to return the phone as it wasn't actually unlocked. it was full of at&t bloatware as well. did not work with republic wireless.
i just bought that phone and it was a present to my sister and now the phone has turned out to be a nightmare.
my real rating would be about 3.75 stars if i could give that.  i used the phone for a week before writing this review.  the ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the home key and the trim at the top.  they aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so i don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  i'm also a little concerned that the usb port is worn.  it doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  so far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  i'm with at&t, moving up from an s5.  i had to get a new sim card (different size) from at&t, which the tech installed for free.  i asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a you tube.  he stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which i believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  problem was, this is an unlocked verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (i'm assuming from verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  i kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  i used samsung's ""smart switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  that worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  battery life seems good.  i'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  it took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  a nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  i got 2.5 years out of my refurbished s5, which still works although is getting quirky.  if this one lasts as long i'll have no complaints.

my real rating would be about 3.75 stars if i could give that.  i used the phone for a week before writing this review.  the ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the home key and the trim at the top.  they aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so i don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  i'm also a little concerned that the usb port is worn.  it doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  so far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  i'm with at&t, moving up from an s5.  i had to get a new sim card (different size) from at&t, which the tech installed for free.  i asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a you tube.  he stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which i believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  problem was, this is an unlocked verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (i'm assuming from verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  i kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  i used samsung's ""smart switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  that worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  battery life seems good.  i'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  it took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  a nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  i got 2.5 years out of my refurbished s5, which still works although is getting quirky.  if this one lasts as long i'll have no complaints.
failed in less than two months. battery is losing charge fast. screen started flickering and phone started automatically deleting data without user doing anything to cause it.
this is my wife's galaxy s7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  our carrier required an unlocked gsm phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""verizon"" on the back).  the phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later i got the sim card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).after about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * that was the problem! *  once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  so.....should this happen to your s7 from kiss electronics......when you buy one of these from kiss electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  i do not know if this was kiss electronic's fault or samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been master reset.  once you get the cell, before you do anything to it, i would suggest doing the master reset just to be sure/safe.
i purchased this samsung g7 from what was touted as ""amazon's choice refurbisher"".  i thought i would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  the first problem i saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  the phone would take pictures, and i don't take lots of pictures, so i decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  i need a phone for my business, and i didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.the second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  even in the first month of using the phone, i could seldom get through a day on a charge.  i am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  i just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  i read several articles, and i went in and removed and disabled every app that i could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  i got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.the final straw is that now, in september, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  i am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old samsung g5 in order to get me by (i have to have a phone for my business), until i can order another phone.  of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.the bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" amazon phone.  find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  these phones have been returned because of a problem, and amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.
i purchased the refurbished galaxy s7 for my son's 17th birthday.  it arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  however, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the samsung phones after updating to android 8 (oreo).  we made sure the os and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by samsung to address this issue in the samsung community.  no joy! there are many posts there concerning this issue.  i hope samsung finds a fix soon.  it is otherwise a great phone.fortunately, the seller, buyspry, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  i do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.
do not bother buying one of these! they obviously do not inspect them properly if i was able to notice a very obvious screen defect withing a few hours of owning the phone! they should have caught that and never tried to pass this phone off on anyone!  the first day i got the phone i noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. i did not notice this until i already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so i figured i would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. it proved to be extremely annoying. after a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. it is infuriating because now i won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. this whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and i greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".
great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.

so! after not getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my plain cardboard box this phone came in, i took it back to jamaica where my ""gsm unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (meaning it is not unlocked). i have bought gsm unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in jamaica, but not this one. after requesting an unlock code from at&t, only to be told that ""this device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".i want all of my money back, and i deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.
i had to return the phone as it wasn't actually unlocked. it was full of at&t bloatware as well. did not work with republic wireless.
i just bought that phone and it was a present to my sister and now the phone has turned out to be a nightmare.
my real rating would be about 3.75 stars if i could give that.  i used the phone for a week before writing this review.  the ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the home key and the trim at the top.  they aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so i don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  i'm also a little concerned that the usb port is worn.  it doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  so far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  i'm with at&t, moving up from an s5.  i had to get a new sim card (different size) from at&t, which the tech installed for free.  i asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a you tube.  he stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which i believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  problem was, this is an unlocked verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (i'm assuming from verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  i kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  i used samsung's ""smart switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  that worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  battery life seems good.  i'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  it took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  a nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  i got 2.5 years out of my refurbished s5, which still works although is getting quirky.  if this one lasts as long i'll have no complaints.
so! after not getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my plain cardboard box this phone came in, i took it back to jamaica where my ""gsm unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (meaning it is not unlocked). i have bought gsm unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in jamaica, but not this one. after requesting an unlock code from at&t, only to be told that ""this device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".i want all of my money back, and i deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.
failed in less than two months. battery is losing charge fast. screen started flickering and phone started automatically deleting data without user doing anything to cause it.
this is my wife's galaxy s7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  our carrier required an unlocked gsm phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""verizon"" on the back).  the phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later i got the sim card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).after about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * that was the problem! *  once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  so.....should this happen to your s7 from kiss electronics......when you buy one of these from kiss electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  i do not know if this was kiss electronic's fault or samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been master reset.  once you get the cell, before you do anything to it, i would suggest doing the master reset just to be sure/safe.
i purchased this samsung g7 from what was touted as ""amazon's choice refurbisher"".  i thought i would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  the first problem i saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  the phone would take pictures, and i don't take lots of pictures, so i decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  i need a phone for my business, and i didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.the second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  even in the first month of using the phone, i could seldom get through a day on a charge.  i am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  i just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  i read several articles, and i went in and removed and disabled every app that i could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  i got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.the final straw is that now, in september, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  i am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old samsung g5 in order to get me by (i have to have a phone for my business), until i can order another phone.  of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.the bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" amazon phone.  find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  these phones have been returned because of a problem, and amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

i purchased this samsung g7 from what was touted as ""amazon's choice refurbisher"".  i thought i would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  the first problem i saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  the phone would take pictures, and i don't take lots of pictures, so i decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  i need a phone for my business, and i didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.the second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  even in the first month of using the phone, i could seldom get through a day on a charge.  i am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  i just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  i read several articles, and i went in and removed and disabled every app that i could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  i got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.the final straw is that now, in september, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  i am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old samsung g5 in order to get me by (i have to have a phone for my business), until i can order another phone.  of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.the bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" amazon phone.  find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  these phones have been returned because of a problem, and amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.
i purchased the refurbished galaxy s7 for my son's 17th birthday.  it arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  however, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the samsung phones after updating to android 8 (oreo).  we made sure the os and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by samsung to address this issue in the samsung community.  no joy! there are many posts there concerning this issue.  i hope samsung finds a fix soon.  it is otherwise a great phone.fortunately, the seller, buyspry, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  i do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.
do not bother buying one of these! they obviously do not inspect them properly if i was able to notice a very obvious screen defect withing a few hours of owning the phone! they should have caught that and never tried to pass this phone off on anyone!  the first day i got the phone i noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. i did not notice this until i already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so i figured i would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. it proved to be extremely annoying. after a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. it is infuriating because now i won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. this whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and i greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".
great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.
i had to return the phone as it wasn't actually unlocked. it was full of at&t bloatware as well. did not work with republic wireless.
i just bought that phone and it was a present to my sister and now the phone has turned out to be a nightmare.
my real rating would be about 3.75 stars if i could give that.  i used the phone for a week before writing this review.  the ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the home key and the trim at the top.  they aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so i don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  i'm also a little concerned that the usb port is worn.  it doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  so far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  i'm with at&t, moving up from an s5.  i had to get a new sim card (different size) from at&t, which the tech installed for free.  i asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a you tube.  he stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which i believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  problem was, this is an unlocked verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (i'm assuming from verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  i kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  i used samsung's ""smart switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  that worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  battery life seems good.  i'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  it took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  a nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  i got 2.5 years out of my refurbished s5, which still works although is getting quirky.  if this one lasts as long i'll have no complaints.
so! after not getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my plain cardboard box this phone came in, i took it back to jamaica where my ""gsm unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (meaning it is not unlocked). i have bought gsm unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in jamaica, but not this one. after requesting an unlock code from at&t, only to be told that ""this device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".i want all of my money back, and i deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

my real rating would be about 3.75 stars if i could give that.  i used the phone for a week before writing this review.  the ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the home key and the trim at the top.  they aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so i don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  i'm also a little concerned that the usb port is worn.  it doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  so far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  i'm with at&t, moving up from an s5.  i had to get a new sim card (different size) from at&t, which the tech installed for free.  i asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a you tube.  he stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which i believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  problem was, this is an unlocked verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (i'm assuming from verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  i kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  i used samsung's ""smart switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  that worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  battery life seems good.  i'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  it took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  a nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  i got 2.5 years out of my refurbished s5, which still works although is getting quirky.  if this one lasts as long i'll have no complaints.
so! after not getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my plain cardboard box this phone came in, i took it back to jamaica where my ""gsm unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (meaning it is not unlocked). i have bought gsm unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in jamaica, but not this one. after requesting an unlock code from at&t, only to be told that ""this device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".i want all of my money back, and i deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.
failed in less than two months. battery is losing charge fast. screen started flickering and phone started automatically deleting data without user doing anything to cause it.
this is my wife's galaxy s7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  our carrier required an unlocked gsm phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""verizon"" on the back).  the phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later i got the sim card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).after about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * that was the problem! *  once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  so.....should this happen to your s7 from kiss electronics......when you buy one of these from kiss electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  i do not know if this was kiss electronic's fault or samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been master reset.  once you get the cell, before you do anything to it, i would suggest doing the master reset just to be sure/safe.
i purchased this samsung g7 from what was touted as ""amazon's choice refurbisher"".  i thought i would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  the first problem i saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  the phone would take pictures, and i don't take lots of pictures, so i decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  i need a phone for my business, and i didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.the second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  even in the first month of using the phone, i could seldom get through a day on a charge.  i am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  i just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  i read several articles, and i went in and removed and disabled every app that i could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  i got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.the final straw is that now, in september, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  i am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old samsung g5 in order to get me by (i have to have a phone for my business), until i can order another phone.  of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.the bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" amazon phone.  find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  these phones have been returned because of a problem, and amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.
i purchased the refurbished galaxy s7 for my son's 17th birthday.  it arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  however, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the samsung phones after updating to android 8 (oreo).  we made sure the os and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by samsung to address this issue in the samsung community.  no joy! there are many posts there concerning this issue.  i hope samsung finds a fix soon.  it is otherwise a great phone.fortunately, the seller, buyspry, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  i do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.
do not bother buying one of these! they obviously do not inspect them properly if i was able to notice a very obvious screen defect withing a few hours of owning the phone! they should have caught that and never tried to pass this phone off on anyone!  the first day i got the phone i noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. i did not notice this until i already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so i figured i would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. it proved to be extremely annoying. after a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. it is infuriating because now i won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. this whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and i greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".
great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.

do not bother buying one of these! they obviously do not inspect them properly if i was able to notice a very obvious screen defect withing a few hours of owning the phone! they should have caught that and never tried to pass this phone off on anyone!  the first day i got the phone i noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. i did not notice this until i already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so i figured i would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. it proved to be extremely annoying. after a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. it is infuriating because now i won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. this whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and i greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".
great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.
i had to return the phone as it wasn't actually unlocked. it was full of at&t bloatware as well. did not work with republic wireless.
i just bought that phone and it was a present to my sister and now the phone has turned out to be a nightmare.
my real rating would be about 3.75 stars if i could give that.  i used the phone for a week before writing this review.  the ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the home key and the trim at the top.  they aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so i don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  i'm also a little concerned that the usb port is worn.  it doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  so far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  i'm with at&t, moving up from an s5.  i had to get a new sim card (different size) from at&t, which the tech installed for free.  i asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a you tube.  he stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which i believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  problem was, this is an unlocked verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (i'm assuming from verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  i kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  i used samsung's ""smart switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  that worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  battery life seems good.  i'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  it took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  a nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  i got 2.5 years out of my refurbished s5, which still works although is getting quirky.  if this one lasts as long i'll have no complaints.
so! after not getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my plain cardboard box this phone came in, i took it back to jamaica where my ""gsm unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (meaning it is not unlocked). i have bought gsm unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in jamaica, but not this one. after requesting an unlock code from at&t, only to be told that ""this device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".i want all of my money back, and i deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.
failed in less than two months. battery is losing charge fast. screen started flickering and phone started automatically deleting data without user doing anything to cause it.
this is my wife's galaxy s7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  our carrier required an unlocked gsm phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""verizon"" on the back).  the phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later i got the sim card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).after about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * that was the problem! *  once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  so.....should this happen to your s7 from kiss electronics......when you buy one of these from kiss electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  i do not know if this was kiss electronic's fault or samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been master reset.  once you get the cell, before you do anything to it, i would suggest doing the master reset just to be sure/safe.

this is my wife's galaxy s7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  our carrier required an unlocked gsm phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""verizon"" on the back).  the phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later i got the sim card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).after about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * that was the problem! *  once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  so.....should this happen to your s7 from kiss electronics......when you buy one of these from kiss electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  i do not know if this was kiss electronic's fault or samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been master reset.  once you get the cell, before you do anything to it, i would suggest doing the master reset just to be sure/safe.
so! after not getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my plain cardboard box this phone came in, i took it back to jamaica where my ""gsm unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (meaning it is not unlocked). i have bought gsm unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in jamaica, but not this one. after requesting an unlock code from at&t, only to be told that ""this device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".i want all of my money back, and i deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.
i purchased this samsung g7 from what was touted as ""amazon's choice refurbisher"".  i thought i would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  the first problem i saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  the phone would take pictures, and i don't take lots of pictures, so i decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  i need a phone for my business, and i didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.the second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  even in the first month of using the phone, i could seldom get through a day on a charge.  i am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  i just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  i read several articles, and i went in and removed and disabled every app that i could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  i got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.the final straw is that now, in september, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  i am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old samsung g5 in order to get me by (i have to have a phone for my business), until i can order another phone.  of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.the bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" amazon phone.  find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  these phones have been returned because of a problem, and amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.
i purchased the refurbished galaxy s7 for my son's 17th birthday.  it arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  however, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the samsung phones after updating to android 8 (oreo).  we made sure the os and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by samsung to address this issue in the samsung community.  no joy! there are many posts there concerning this issue.  i hope samsung finds a fix soon.  it is otherwise a great phone.fortunately, the seller, buyspry, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  i do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.
do not bother buying one of these! they obviously do not inspect them properly if i was able to notice a very obvious screen defect withing a few hours of owning the phone! they should have caught that and never tried to pass this phone off on anyone!  the first day i got the phone i noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. i did not notice this until i already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so i figured i would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. it proved to be extremely annoying. after a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. it is infuriating because now i won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. this whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and i greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".
great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.
i had to return the phone as it wasn't actually unlocked. it was full of at&t bloatware as well. did not work with republic wireless.
i just bought that phone and it was a present to my sister and now the phone has turned out to be a nightmare.

great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.
i had to return the phone as it wasn't actually unlocked. it was full of at&t bloatware as well. did not work with republic wireless.
i just bought that phone and it was a present to my sister and now the phone has turned out to be a nightmare.
my real rating would be about 3.75 stars if i could give that.  i used the phone for a week before writing this review.  the ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the home key and the trim at the top.  they aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so i don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  i'm also a little concerned that the usb port is worn.  it doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  so far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  i'm with at&t, moving up from an s5.  i had to get a new sim card (different size) from at&t, which the tech installed for free.  i asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a you tube.  he stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which i believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  problem was, this is an unlocked verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (i'm assuming from verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  i kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  i used samsung's ""smart switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  that worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  battery life seems good.  i'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  it took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  a nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  i got 2.5 years out of my refurbished s5, which still works although is getting quirky.  if this one lasts as long i'll have no complaints.
so! after not getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my plain cardboard box this phone came in, i took it back to jamaica where my ""gsm unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (meaning it is not unlocked). i have bought gsm unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in jamaica, but not this one. after requesting an unlock code from at&t, only to be told that ""this device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".i want all of my money back, and i deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

failed in less than two months. battery is losing charge fast. screen started flickering and phone started automatically deleting data without user doing anything to cause it.
this is my wife's galaxy s7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  our carrier required an unlocked gsm phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""verizon"" on the back).  the phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later i got the sim card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).after about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * that was the problem! *  once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  so.....should this happen to your s7 from kiss electronics......when you buy one of these from kiss electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  i do not know if this was kiss electronic's fault or samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been master reset.  once you get the cell, before you do anything to it, i would suggest doing the master reset just to be sure/safe.
i purchased this samsung g7 from what was touted as ""amazon's choice refurbisher"".  i thought i would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  the first problem i saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  the phone would take pictures, and i don't take lots of pictures, so i decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  i need a phone for my business, and i didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.the second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  even in the first month of using the phone, i could seldom get through a day on a charge.  i am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  i just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  i read several articles, and i went in and removed and disabled every app that i could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  i got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.the final straw is that now, in september, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  i am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old samsung g5 in order to get me by (i have to have a phone for my business), until i can order another phone.  of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.the bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" amazon phone.  find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  these phones have been returned because of a problem, and amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

i purchased this samsung g7 from what was touted as ""amazon's choice refurbisher"".  i thought i would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  the first problem i saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  the phone would take pictures, and i don't take lots of pictures, so i decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  i need a phone for my business, and i didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.the second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  even in the first month of using the phone, i could seldom get through a day on a charge.  i am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  i just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  i read several articles, and i went in and removed and disabled every app that i could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  i got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.the final straw is that now, in september, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  i am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old samsung g5 in order to get me by (i have to have a phone for my business), until i can order another phone.  of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.the bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" amazon phone.  find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  these phones have been returned because of a problem, and amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.
i purchased the refurbished galaxy s7 for my son's 17th birthday.  it arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  however, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the samsung phones after updating to android 8 (oreo).  we made sure the os and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by samsung to address this issue in the samsung community.  no joy! there are many posts there concerning this issue.  i hope samsung finds a fix soon.  it is otherwise a great phone.fortunately, the seller, buyspry, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  i do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.
do not bother buying one of these! they obviously do not inspect them properly if i was able to notice a very obvious screen defect withing a few hours of owning the phone! they should have caught that and never tried to pass this phone off on anyone!  the first day i got the phone i noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. i did not notice this until i already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so i figured i would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. it proved to be extremely annoying. after a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. it is infuriating because now i won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. this whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and i greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".
great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.
i had to return the phone as it wasn't actually unlocked. it was full of at&t bloatware as well. did not work with republic wireless.
i just bought that phone and it was a present to my sister and now the phone has turned out to be a nightmare.
my real rating would be about 3.75 stars if i could give that.  i used the phone for a week before writing this review.  the ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the home key and the trim at the top.  they aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so i don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  i'm also a little concerned that the usb port is worn.  it doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  so far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  i'm with at&t, moving up from an s5.  i had to get a new sim card (different size) from at&t, which the tech installed for free.  i asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a you tube.  he stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which i believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  problem was, this is an unlocked verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (i'm assuming from verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  i kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  i used samsung's ""smart switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  that worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  battery life seems good.  i'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  it took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  a nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  i got 2.5 years out of my refurbished s5, which still works although is getting quirky.  if this one lasts as long i'll have no complaints.

so! after not getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my plain cardboard box this phone came in, i took it back to jamaica where my ""gsm unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (meaning it is not unlocked). i have bought gsm unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in jamaica, but not this one. after requesting an unlock code from at&t, only to be told that ""this device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".i want all of my money back, and i deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

so! after not getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my plain cardboard box this phone came in, i took it back to jamaica where my ""gsm unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (meaning it is not unlocked). i have bought gsm unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in jamaica, but not this one. after requesting an unlock code from at&t, only to be told that ""this device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".i want all of my money back, and i deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.
failed in less than two months. battery is losing charge fast. screen started flickering and phone started automatically deleting data without user doing anything to cause it.
this is my wife's galaxy s7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  our carrier required an unlocked gsm phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""verizon"" on the back).  the phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later i got the sim card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).after about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * that was the problem! *  once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  so.....should this happen to your s7 from kiss electronics......when you buy one of these from kiss electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  i do not know if this was kiss electronic's fault or samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been master reset.  once you get the cell, before you do anything to it, i would suggest doing the master reset just to be sure/safe.
i purchased this samsung g7 from what was touted as ""amazon's choice refurbisher"".  i thought i would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  the first problem i saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  the phone would take pictures, and i don't take lots of pictures, so i decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  i need a phone for my business, and i didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.the second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  even in the first month of using the phone, i could seldom get through a day on a charge.  i am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  i just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  i read several articles, and i went in and removed and disabled every app that i could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  i got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.the final straw is that now, in september, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  i am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old samsung g5 in order to get me by (i have to have a phone for my business), until i can order another phone.  of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.the bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" amazon phone.  find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  these phones have been returned because of a problem, and amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.
i purchased the refurbished galaxy s7 for my son's 17th birthday.  it arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  however, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the samsung phones after updating to android 8 (oreo).  we made sure the os and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by samsung to address this issue in the samsung community.  no joy! there are many posts there concerning this issue.  i hope samsung finds a fix soon.  it is otherwise a great phone.fortunately, the seller, buyspry, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  i do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.
do not bother buying one of these! they obviously do not inspect them properly if i was able to notice a very obvious screen defect withing a few hours of owning the phone! they should have caught that and never tried to pass this phone off on anyone!  the first day i got the phone i noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. i did not notice this until i already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so i figured i would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. it proved to be extremely annoying. after a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. it is infuriating because now i won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. this whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and i greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".
great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.
i had to return the phone as it wasn't actually unlocked. it was full of at&t bloatware as well. did not work with republic wireless.

great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.
i had to return the phone as it wasn't actually unlocked. it was full of at&t bloatware as well. did not work with republic wireless.
i just bought that phone and it was a present to my sister and now the phone has turned out to be a nightmare.
my real rating would be about 3.75 stars if i could give that.  i used the phone for a week before writing this review.  the ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the home key and the trim at the top.  they aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so i don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  i'm also a little concerned that the usb port is worn.  it doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  so far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  i'm with at&t, moving up from an s5.  i had to get a new sim card (different size) from at&t, which the tech installed for free.  i asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a you tube.  he stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which i believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  problem was, this is an unlocked verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (i'm assuming from verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  i kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  i used samsung's ""smart switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  that worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  battery life seems good.  i'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  it took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  a nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  i got 2.5 years out of my refurbished s5, which still works although is getting quirky.  if this one lasts as long i'll have no complaints.
so! after not getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my plain cardboard box this phone came in, i took it back to jamaica where my ""gsm unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (meaning it is not unlocked). i have bought gsm unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in jamaica, but not this one. after requesting an unlock code from at&t, only to be told that ""this device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".i want all of my money back, and i deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.
failed in less than two months. battery is losing charge fast. screen started flickering and phone started automatically deleting data without user doing anything to cause it.
this is my wife's galaxy s7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  our carrier required an unlocked gsm phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""verizon"" on the back).  the phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later i got the sim card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).after about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * that was the problem! *  once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  so.....should this happen to your s7 from kiss electronics......when you buy one of these from kiss electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  i do not know if this was kiss electronic's fault or samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been master reset.  once you get the cell, before you do anything to it, i would suggest doing the master reset just to be sure/safe.
i purchased this samsung g7 from what was touted as ""amazon's choice refurbisher"".  i thought i would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  the first problem i saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  the phone would take pictures, and i don't take lots of pictures, so i decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  i need a phone for my business, and i didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.the second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  even in the first month of using the phone, i could seldom get through a day on a charge.  i am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  i just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  i read several articles, and i went in and removed and disabled every app that i could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  i got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.the final straw is that now, in september, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  i am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old samsung g5 in order to get me by (i have to have a phone for my business), until i can order another phone.  of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.the bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" amazon phone.  find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  these phones have been returned because of a problem, and amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

i purchased this samsung g7 from what was touted as ""amazon's choice refurbisher"".  i thought i would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  the first problem i saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  the phone would take pictures, and i don't take lots of pictures, so i decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  i need a phone for my business, and i didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.the second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  even in the first month of using the phone, i could seldom get through a day on a charge.  i am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  i just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  i read several articles, and i went in and removed and disabled every app that i could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  i got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.the final straw is that now, in september, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  i am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old samsung g5 in order to get me by (i have to have a phone for my business), until i can order another phone.  of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.the bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" amazon phone.  find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  these phones have been returned because of a problem, and amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.
i purchased the refurbished galaxy s7 for my son's 17th birthday.  it arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  however, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the samsung phones after updating to android 8 (oreo).  we made sure the os and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by samsung to address this issue in the samsung community.  no joy! there are many posts there concerning this issue.  i hope samsung finds a fix soon.  it is otherwise a great phone.fortunately, the seller, buyspry, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  i do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.
do not bother buying one of these! they obviously do not inspect them properly if i was able to notice a very obvious screen defect withing a few hours of owning the phone! they should have caught that and never tried to pass this phone off on anyone!  the first day i got the phone i noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. i did not notice this until i already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so i figured i would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. it proved to be extremely annoying. after a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. it is infuriating because now i won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. this whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and i greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".
great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.
i had to return the phone as it wasn't actually unlocked. it was full of at&t bloatware as well. did not work with republic wireless.
i just bought that phone and it was a present to my sister and now the phone has turned out to be a nightmare.
my real rating would be about 3.75 stars if i could give that.  i used the phone for a week before writing this review.  the ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the home key and the trim at the top.  they aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so i don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  i'm also a little concerned that the usb port is worn.  it doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  so far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  i'm with at&t, moving up from an s5.  i had to get a new sim card (different size) from at&t, which the tech installed for free.  i asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a you tube.  he stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which i believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  problem was, this is an unlocked verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (i'm assuming from verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  i kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  i used samsung's ""smart switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  that worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  battery life seems good.  i'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  it took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  a nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  i got 2.5 years out of my refurbished s5, which still works although is getting quirky.  if this one lasts as long i'll have no complaints.
so! after not getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my plain cardboard box this phone came in, i took it back to jamaica where my ""gsm unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (meaning it is not unlocked). i have bought gsm unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in jamaica, but not this one. after requesting an unlock code from at&t, only to be told that ""this device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".i want all of my money back, and i deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

my real rating would be about 3.75 stars if i could give that.  i used the phone for a week before writing this review.  the ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the home key and the trim at the top.  they aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so i don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  i'm also a little concerned that the usb port is worn.  it doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  so far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  i'm with at&t, moving up from an s5.  i had to get a new sim card (different size) from at&t, which the tech installed for free.  i asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a you tube.  he stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which i believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  problem was, this is an unlocked verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (i'm assuming from verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  i kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  i used samsung's ""smart switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  that worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  battery life seems good.  i'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  it took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  a nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  i got 2.5 years out of my refurbished s5, which still works although is getting quirky.  if this one lasts as long i'll have no complaints.
so! after not getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my plain cardboard box this phone came in, i took it back to jamaica where my ""gsm unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (meaning it is not unlocked). i have bought gsm unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in jamaica, but not this one. after requesting an unlock code from at&t, only to be told that ""this device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".i want all of my money back, and i deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

i purchased this samsung g7 from what was touted as ""amazon's choice refurbisher"".  i thought i would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  the first problem i saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  the phone would take pictures, and i don't take lots of pictures, so i decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  i need a phone for my business, and i didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.the second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  even in the first month of using the phone, i could seldom get through a day on a charge.  i am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  i just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  i read several articles, and i went in and removed and disabled every app that i could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  i got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.the final straw is that now, in september, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  i am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old samsung g5 in order to get me by (i have to have a phone for my business), until i can order another phone.  of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.the bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" amazon phone.  find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  these phones have been returned because of a problem, and amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.
i purchased the refurbished galaxy s7 for my son's 17th birthday.  it arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  however, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the samsung phones after updating to android 8 (oreo).  we made sure the os and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by samsung to address this issue in the samsung community.  no joy! there are many posts there concerning this issue.  i hope samsung finds a fix soon.  it is otherwise a great phone.fortunately, the seller, buyspry, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  i do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.
do not bother buying one of these! they obviously do not inspect them properly if i was able to notice a very obvious screen defect withing a few hours of owning the phone! they should have caught that and never tried to pass this phone off on anyone!  the first day i got the phone i noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. i did not notice this until i already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so i figured i would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. it proved to be extremely annoying. after a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. it is infuriating because now i won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. this whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and i greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".
great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.

do not bother buying one of these! they obviously do not inspect them properly if i was able to notice a very obvious screen defect withing a few hours of owning the phone! they should have caught that and never tried to pass this phone off on anyone!  the first day i got the phone i noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. i did not notice this until i already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so i figured i would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. it proved to be extremely annoying. after a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. it is infuriating because now i won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. this whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and i greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".
great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.
i had to return the phone as it wasn't actually unlocked. it was full of at&t bloatware as well. did not work with republic wireless.
i just bought that phone and it was a present to my sister and now the phone has turned out to be a nightmare.
my real rating would be about 3.75 stars if i could give that.  i used the phone for a week before writing this review.  the ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the home key and the trim at the top.  they aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so i don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  i'm also a little concerned that the usb port is worn.  it doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  so far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  i'm with at&t, moving up from an s5.  i had to get a new sim card (different size) from at&t, which the tech installed for free.  i asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a you tube.  he stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which i believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  problem was, this is an unlocked verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (i'm assuming from verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  i kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  i used samsung's ""smart switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  that worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  battery life seems good.  i'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  it took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  a nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  i got 2.5 years out of my refurbished s5, which still works although is getting quirky.  if this one lasts as long i'll have no complaints.
failed in less than two months. battery is losing charge fast. screen started flickering and phone started automatically deleting data without user doing anything to cause it.
this is my wife's galaxy s7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  our carrier required an unlocked gsm phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""verizon"" on the back).  the phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later i got the sim card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).after about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * that was the problem! *  once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  so.....should this happen to your s7 from kiss electronics......when you buy one of these from kiss electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  i do not know if this was kiss electronic's fault or samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been master reset.  once you get the cell, before you do anything to it, i would suggest doing the master reset just to be sure/safe.

so! after not getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my plain cardboard box this phone came in, i took it back to jamaica where my ""gsm unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (meaning it is not unlocked). i have bought gsm unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in jamaica, but not this one. after requesting an unlock code from at&t, only to be told that ""this device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".i want all of my money back, and i deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

i purchased this samsung g7 from what was touted as ""amazon's choice refurbisher"".  i thought i would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  the first problem i saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  the phone would take pictures, and i don't take lots of pictures, so i decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  i need a phone for my business, and i didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.the second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  even in the first month of using the phone, i could seldom get through a day on a charge.  i am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  i just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  i read several articles, and i went in and removed and disabled every app that i could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  i got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.the final straw is that now, in september, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  i am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old samsung g5 in order to get me by (i have to have a phone for my business), until i can order another phone.  of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.the bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" amazon phone.  find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  these phones have been returned because of a problem, and amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.

do not bother buying one of these! they obviously do not inspect them properly if i was able to notice a very obvious screen defect withing a few hours of owning the phone! they should have caught that and never tried to pass this phone off on anyone!  the first day i got the phone i noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. i did not notice this until i already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so i figured i would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. it proved to be extremely annoying. after a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. it is infuriating because now i won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. this whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and i greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".
great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.

this is my wife's galaxy s7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  our carrier required an unlocked gsm phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""verizon"" on the back).  the phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later i got the sim card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).after about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * that was the problem! *  once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  so.....should this happen to your s7 from kiss electronics......when you buy one of these from kiss electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  i do not know if this was kiss electronic's fault or samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been master reset.  once you get the cell, before you do anything to it, i would suggest doing the master reset just to be sure/safe.
i purchased this samsung g7 from what was touted as ""amazon's choice refurbisher"".  i thought i would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  the first problem i saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  the phone would take pictures, and i don't take lots of pictures, so i decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  i need a phone for my business, and i didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.the second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  even in the first month of using the phone, i could seldom get through a day on a charge.  i am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  i just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  i read several articles, and i went in and removed and disabled every app that i could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  i got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.the final straw is that now, in september, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  i am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old samsung g5 in order to get me by (i have to have a phone for my business), until i can order another phone.  of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.the bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" amazon phone.  find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  these phones have been returned because of a problem, and amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.
i purchased the refurbished galaxy s7 for my son's 17th birthday.  it arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  however, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the samsung phones after updating to android 8 (oreo).  we made sure the os and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by samsung to address this issue in the samsung community.  no joy! there are many posts there concerning this issue.  i hope samsung finds a fix soon.  it is otherwise a great phone.fortunately, the seller, buyspry, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  i do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.
do not bother buying one of these! they obviously do not inspect them properly if i was able to notice a very obvious screen defect withing a few hours of owning the phone! they should have caught that and never tried to pass this phone off on anyone!  the first day i got the phone i noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. i did not notice this until i already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so i figured i would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. it proved to be extremely annoying. after a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. it is infuriating because now i won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. this whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and i greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".
great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.
i had to return the phone as it wasn't actually unlocked. it was full of at&t bloatware as well. did not work with republic wireless.
i just bought that phone and it was a present to my sister and now the phone has turned out to be a nightmare.

so! after not getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my plain cardboard box this phone came in, i took it back to jamaica where my ""gsm unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (meaning it is not unlocked). i have bought gsm unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in jamaica, but not this one. after requesting an unlock code from at&t, only to be told that ""this device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".i want all of my money back, and i deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.

my real rating would be about 3.75 stars if i could give that.  i used the phone for a week before writing this review.  the ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the home key and the trim at the top.  they aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so i don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  i'm also a little concerned that the usb port is worn.  it doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  so far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  i'm with at&t, moving up from an s5.  i had to get a new sim card (different size) from at&t, which the tech installed for free.  i asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a you tube.  he stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which i believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  problem was, this is an unlocked verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (i'm assuming from verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  i kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  i used samsung's ""smart switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  that worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  battery life seems good.  i'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  it took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  a nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  i got 2.5 years out of my refurbished s5, which still works although is getting quirky.  if this one lasts as long i'll have no complaints.
so! after not getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my plain cardboard box this phone came in, i took it back to jamaica where my ""gsm unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (meaning it is not unlocked). i have bought gsm unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in jamaica, but not this one. after requesting an unlock code from at&t, only to be told that ""this device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".i want all of my money back, and i deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.
failed in less than two months. battery is losing charge fast. screen started flickering and phone started automatically deleting data without user doing anything to cause it.
this is my wife's galaxy s7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  our carrier required an unlocked gsm phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""verizon"" on the back).  the phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later i got the sim card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).after about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * that was the problem! *  once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  so.....should this happen to your s7 from kiss electronics......when you buy one of these from kiss electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  i do not know if this was kiss electronic's fault or samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been master reset.  once you get the cell, before you do anything to it, i would suggest doing the master reset just to be sure/safe.
i purchased this samsung g7 from what was touted as ""amazon's choice refurbisher"".  i thought i would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  the first problem i saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  the phone would take pictures, and i don't take lots of pictures, so i decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  i need a phone for my business, and i didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.the second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  even in the first month of using the phone, i could seldom get through a day on a charge.  i am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  i just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  i read several articles, and i went in and removed and disabled every app that i could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  i got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.the final straw is that now, in september, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  i am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old samsung g5 in order to get me by (i have to have a phone for my business), until i can order another phone.  of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.the bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" amazon phone.  find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  these phones have been returned because of a problem, and amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.
i purchased the refurbished galaxy s7 for my son's 17th birthday.  it arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  however, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the samsung phones after updating to android 8 (oreo).  we made sure the os and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by samsung to address this issue in the samsung community.  no joy! there are many posts there concerning this issue.  i hope samsung finds a fix soon.  it is otherwise a great phone.fortunately, the seller, buyspry, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  i do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.
do not bother buying one of these! they obviously do not inspect them properly if i was able to notice a very obvious screen defect withing a few hours of owning the phone! they should have caught that and never tried to pass this phone off on anyone!  the first day i got the phone i noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. i did not notice this until i already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so i figured i would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. it proved to be extremely annoying. after a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. it is infuriating because now i won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. this whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and i greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".
great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.

i purchased the refurbished galaxy s7 for my son's 17th birthday.  it arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  however, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the samsung phones after updating to android 8 (oreo).  we made sure the os and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by samsung to address this issue in the samsung community.  no joy! there are many posts there concerning this issue.  i hope samsung finds a fix soon.  it is otherwise a great phone.fortunately, the seller, buyspry, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  i do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.
do not bother buying one of these! they obviously do not inspect them properly if i was able to notice a very obvious screen defect withing a few hours of owning the phone! they should have caught that and never tried to pass this phone off on anyone!  the first day i got the phone i noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. i did not notice this until i already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so i figured i would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. it proved to be extremely annoying. after a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. it is infuriating because now i won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. this whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and i greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".
great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.
i had to return the phone as it wasn't actually unlocked. it was full of at&t bloatware as well. did not work with republic wireless.
i just bought that phone and it was a present to my sister and now the phone has turned out to be a nightmare.
my real rating would be about 3.75 stars if i could give that.  i used the phone for a week before writing this review.  the ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the home key and the trim at the top.  they aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so i don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  i'm also a little concerned that the usb port is worn.  it doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  so far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  i'm with at&t, moving up from an s5.  i had to get a new sim card (different size) from at&t, which the tech installed for free.  i asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a you tube.  he stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which i believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  problem was, this is an unlocked verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (i'm assuming from verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  i kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  i used samsung's ""smart switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  that worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  battery life seems good.  i'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  it took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  a nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  i got 2.5 years out of my refurbished s5, which still works although is getting quirky.  if this one lasts as long i'll have no complaints.
failed in less than two months. battery is losing charge fast. screen started flickering and phone started automatically deleting data without user doing anything to cause it.

this is my wife's galaxy s7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  our carrier required an unlocked gsm phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""verizon"" on the back).  the phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later i got the sim card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).after about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * that was the problem! *  once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  so.....should this happen to your s7 from kiss electronics......when you buy one of these from kiss electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  i do not know if this was kiss electronic's fault or samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been master reset.  once you get the cell, before you do anything to it, i would suggest doing the master reset just to be sure/safe.
i purchased this samsung g7 from what was touted as ""amazon's choice refurbisher"".  i thought i would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  the first problem i saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  the phone would take pictures, and i don't take lots of pictures, so i decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  i need a phone for my business, and i didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.the second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  even in the first month of using the phone, i could seldom get through a day on a charge.  i am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  i just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  i read several articles, and i went in and removed and disabled every app that i could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  i got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.the final straw is that now, in september, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  i am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old samsung g5 in order to get me by (i have to have a phone for my business), until i can order another phone.  of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.the bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" amazon phone.  find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  these phones have been returned because of a problem, and amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.
i purchased the refurbished galaxy s7 for my son's 17th birthday.  it arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  however, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the samsung phones after updating to android 8 (oreo).  we made sure the os and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by samsung to address this issue in the samsung community.  no joy! there are many posts there concerning this issue.  i hope samsung finds a fix soon.  it is otherwise a great phone.fortunately, the seller, buyspry, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  i do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.
do not bother buying one of these! they obviously do not inspect them properly if i was able to notice a very obvious screen defect withing a few hours of owning the phone! they should have caught that and never tried to pass this phone off on anyone!  the first day i got the phone i noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. i did not notice this until i already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so i figured i would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. it proved to be extremely annoying. after a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. it is infuriating because now i won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. this whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and i greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".
great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.
i had to return the phone as it wasn't actually unlocked. it was full of at&t bloatware as well. did not work with republic wireless.
i just bought that phone and it was a present to my sister and now the phone has turned out to be a nightmare.
my real rating would be about 3.75 stars if i could give that.  i used the phone for a week before writing this review.  the ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the home key and the trim at the top.  they aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so i don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  i'm also a little concerned that the usb port is worn.  it doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  so far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  i'm with at&t, moving up from an s5.  i had to get a new sim card (different size) from at&t, which the tech installed for free.  i asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a you tube.  he stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which i believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  problem was, this is an unlocked verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (i'm assuming from verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  i kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  i used samsung's ""smart switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  that worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  battery life seems good.  i'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  it took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  a nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  i got 2.5 years out of my refurbished s5, which still works although is getting quirky.  if this one lasts as long i'll have no complaints.

my real rating would be about 3.75 stars if i could give that.  i used the phone for a week before writing this review.  the ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the home key and the trim at the top.  they aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so i don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  i'm also a little concerned that the usb port is worn.  it doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  so far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  i'm with at&t, moving up from an s5.  i had to get a new sim card (different size) from at&t, which the tech installed for free.  i asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a you tube.  he stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which i believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  problem was, this is an unlocked verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (i'm assuming from verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  i kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  i used samsung's ""smart switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  that worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  battery life seems good.  i'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  it took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  a nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  i got 2.5 years out of my refurbished s5, which still works although is getting quirky.  if this one lasts as long i'll have no complaints.
so! after not getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my plain cardboard box this phone came in, i took it back to jamaica where my ""gsm unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (meaning it is not unlocked). i have bought gsm unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in jamaica, but not this one. after requesting an unlock code from at&t, only to be told that ""this device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".i want all of my money back, and i deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.
failed in less than two months. battery is losing charge fast. screen started flickering and phone started automatically deleting data without user doing anything to cause it.
this is my wife's galaxy s7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  our carrier required an unlocked gsm phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""verizon"" on the back).  the phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later i got the sim card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).after about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * that was the problem! *  once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  so.....should this happen to your s7 from kiss electronics......when you buy one of these from kiss electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  i do not know if this was kiss electronic's fault or samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been master reset.  once you get the cell, before you do anything to it, i would suggest doing the master reset just to be sure/safe.
i purchased this samsung g7 from what was touted as ""amazon's choice refurbisher"".  i thought i would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  the first problem i saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  the phone would take pictures, and i don't take lots of pictures, so i decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  i need a phone for my business, and i didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.the second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  even in the first month of using the phone, i could seldom get through a day on a charge.  i am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  i just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  i read several articles, and i went in and removed and disabled every app that i could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  i got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.the final straw is that now, in september, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  i am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old samsung g5 in order to get me by (i have to have a phone for my business), until i can order another phone.  of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.the bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" amazon phone.  find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  these phones have been returned because of a problem, and amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.
i purchased the refurbished galaxy s7 for my son's 17th birthday.  it arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  however, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the samsung phones after updating to android 8 (oreo).  we made sure the os and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by samsung to address this issue in the samsung community.  no joy! there are many posts there concerning this issue.  i hope samsung finds a fix soon.  it is otherwise a great phone.fortunately, the seller, buyspry, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  i do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.
do not bother buying one of these! they obviously do not inspect them properly if i was able to notice a very obvious screen defect withing a few hours of owning the phone! they should have caught that and never tried to pass this phone off on anyone!  the first day i got the phone i noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. i did not notice this until i already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so i figured i would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. it proved to be extremely annoying. after a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. it is infuriating because now i won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. this whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and i greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".
great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.

do not bother buying one of these! they obviously do not inspect them properly if i was able to notice a very obvious screen defect withing a few hours of owning the phone! they should have caught that and never tried to pass this phone off on anyone!  the first day i got the phone i noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. i did not notice this until i already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so i figured i would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. it proved to be extremely annoying. after a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. it is infuriating because now i won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. this whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and i greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".
great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.
i had to return the phone as it wasn't actually unlocked. it was full of at&t bloatware as well. did not work with republic wireless.
i just bought that phone and it was a present to my sister and now the phone has turned out to be a nightmare.
my real rating would be about 3.75 stars if i could give that.  i used the phone for a week before writing this review.  the ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the home key and the trim at the top.  they aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so i don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  i'm also a little concerned that the usb port is worn.  it doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  so far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  i'm with at&t, moving up from an s5.  i had to get a new sim card (different size) from at&t, which the tech installed for free.  i asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a you tube.  he stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which i believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  problem was, this is an unlocked verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (i'm assuming from verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  i kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  i used samsung's ""smart switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  that worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  battery life seems good.  i'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  it took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  a nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  i got 2.5 years out of my refurbished s5, which still works although is getting quirky.  if this one lasts as long i'll have no complaints.
so! after not getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my plain cardboard box this phone came in, i took it back to jamaica where my ""gsm unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (meaning it is not unlocked). i have bought gsm unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in jamaica, but not this one. after requesting an unlock code from at&t, only to be told that ""this device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".i want all of my money back, and i deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.
failed in less than two months. battery is losing charge fast. screen started flickering and phone started automatically deleting data without user doing anything to cause it.
this is my wife's galaxy s7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  our carrier required an unlocked gsm phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""verizon"" on the back).  the phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later i got the sim card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).after about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * that was the problem! *  once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  so.....should this happen to your s7 from kiss electronics......when you buy one of these from kiss electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  i do not know if this was kiss electronic's fault or samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been master reset.  once you get the cell, before you do anything to it, i would suggest doing the master reset just to be sure/safe.

this is my wife's galaxy s7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  our carrier required an unlocked gsm phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""verizon"" on the back).  the phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later i got the sim card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).after about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * that was the problem! *  once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  so.....should this happen to your s7 from kiss electronics......when you buy one of these from kiss electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  i do not know if this was kiss electronic's fault or samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been master reset.  once you get the cell, before you do anything to it, i would suggest doing the master reset just to be sure/safe.
i purchased this samsung g7 from what was touted as ""amazon's choice refurbisher"".  i thought i would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  the first problem i saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  the phone would take pictures, and i don't take lots of pictures, so i decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  i need a phone for my business, and i didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.the second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  even in the first month of using the phone, i could seldom get through a day on a charge.  i am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  i just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  i read several articles, and i went in and removed and disabled every app that i could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  i got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.the final straw is that now, in september, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  i am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old samsung g5 in order to get me by (i have to have a phone for my business), until i can order another phone.  of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.the bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" amazon phone.  find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  these phones have been returned because of a problem, and amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.
i purchased the refurbished galaxy s7 for my son's 17th birthday.  it arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  however, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the samsung phones after updating to android 8 (oreo).  we made sure the os and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by samsung to address this issue in the samsung community.  no joy! there are many posts there concerning this issue.  i hope samsung finds a fix soon.  it is otherwise a great phone.fortunately, the seller, buyspry, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  i do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.
do not bother buying one of these! they obviously do not inspect them properly if i was able to notice a very obvious screen defect withing a few hours of owning the phone! they should have caught that and never tried to pass this phone off on anyone!  the first day i got the phone i noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. i did not notice this until i already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so i figured i would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. it proved to be extremely annoying. after a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. it is infuriating because now i won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. this whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and i greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".
great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.
i had to return the phone as it wasn't actually unlocked. it was full of at&t bloatware as well. did not work with republic wireless.
i just bought that phone and it was a present to my sister and now the phone has turned out to be a nightmare.
my real rating would be about 3.75 stars if i could give that.  i used the phone for a week before writing this review.  the ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the home key and the trim at the top.  they aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so i don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  i'm also a little concerned that the usb port is worn.  it doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  so far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  i'm with at&t, moving up from an s5.  i had to get a new sim card (different size) from at&t, which the tech installed for free.  i asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a you tube.  he stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which i believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  problem was, this is an unlocked verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (i'm assuming from verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  i kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  i used samsung's ""smart switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  that worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  battery life seems good.  i'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  it took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  a nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  i got 2.5 years out of my refurbished s5, which still works although is getting quirky.  if this one lasts as long i'll have no complaints.

my real rating would be about 3.75 stars if i could give that.  i used the phone for a week before writing this review.  the ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the home key and the trim at the top.  they aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so i don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  i'm also a little concerned that the usb port is worn.  it doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  so far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  i'm with at&t, moving up from an s5.  i had to get a new sim card (different size) from at&t, which the tech installed for free.  i asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a you tube.  he stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which i believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  problem was, this is an unlocked verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (i'm assuming from verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  i kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  i used samsung's ""smart switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  that worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  battery life seems good.  i'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  it took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  a nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  i got 2.5 years out of my refurbished s5, which still works although is getting quirky.  if this one lasts as long i'll have no complaints.
so! after not getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my plain cardboard box this phone came in, i took it back to jamaica where my ""gsm unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (meaning it is not unlocked). i have bought gsm unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in jamaica, but not this one. after requesting an unlock code from at&t, only to be told that ""this device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".i want all of my money back, and i deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.
failed in less than two months. battery is losing charge fast. screen started flickering and phone started automatically deleting data without user doing anything to cause it.
this is my wife's galaxy s7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  our carrier required an unlocked gsm phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""verizon"" on the back).  the phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later i got the sim card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).after about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * that was the problem! *  once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  so.....should this happen to your s7 from kiss electronics......when you buy one of these from kiss electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  i do not know if this was kiss electronic's fault or samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been master reset.  once you get the cell, before you do anything to it, i would suggest doing the master reset just to be sure/safe.
i purchased this samsung g7 from what was touted as ""amazon's choice refurbisher"".  i thought i would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  the first problem i saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  the phone would take pictures, and i don't take lots of pictures, so i decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  i need a phone for my business, and i didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.the second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  even in the first month of using the phone, i could seldom get through a day on a charge.  i am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  i just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  i read several articles, and i went in and removed and disabled every app that i could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  i got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.the final straw is that now, in september, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  i am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old samsung g5 in order to get me by (i have to have a phone for my business), until i can order another phone.  of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.the bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" amazon phone.  find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  these phones have been returned because of a problem, and amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.
i purchased the refurbished galaxy s7 for my son's 17th birthday.  it arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  however, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the samsung phones after updating to android 8 (oreo).  we made sure the os and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by samsung to address this issue in the samsung community.  no joy! there are many posts there concerning this issue.  i hope samsung finds a fix soon.  it is otherwise a great phone.fortunately, the seller, buyspry, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  i do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.
do not bother buying one of these! they obviously do not inspect them properly if i was able to notice a very obvious screen defect withing a few hours of owning the phone! they should have caught that and never tried to pass this phone off on anyone!  the first day i got the phone i noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. i did not notice this until i already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so i figured i would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. it proved to be extremely annoying. after a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. it is infuriating because now i won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. this whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and i greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".
great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.

do not bother buying one of these! they obviously do not inspect them properly if i was able to notice a very obvious screen defect withing a few hours of owning the phone! they should have caught that and never tried to pass this phone off on anyone!  the first day i got the phone i noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. i did not notice this until i already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so i figured i would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. it proved to be extremely annoying. after a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. it is infuriating because now i won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. this whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and i greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".
great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.
i had to return the phone as it wasn't actually unlocked. it was full of at&t bloatware as well. did not work with republic wireless.
i just bought that phone and it was a present to my sister and now the phone has turned out to be a nightmare.
my real rating would be about 3.75 stars if i could give that.  i used the phone for a week before writing this review.  the ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the home key and the trim at the top.  they aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so i don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  i'm also a little concerned that the usb port is worn.  it doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  so far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  i'm with at&t, moving up from an s5.  i had to get a new sim card (different size) from at&t, which the tech installed for free.  i asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a you tube.  he stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which i believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  problem was, this is an unlocked verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (i'm assuming from verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  i kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  i used samsung's ""smart switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  that worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  battery life seems good.  i'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  it took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  a nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  i got 2.5 years out of my refurbished s5, which still works although is getting quirky.  if this one lasts as long i'll have no complaints.
so! after not getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my plain cardboard box this phone came in, i took it back to jamaica where my ""gsm unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (meaning it is not unlocked). i have bought gsm unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in jamaica, but not this one. after requesting an unlock code from at&t, only to be told that ""this device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".i want all of my money back, and i deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.
failed in less than two months. battery is losing charge fast. screen started flickering and phone started automatically deleting data without user doing anything to cause it.
this is my wife's galaxy s7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  our carrier required an unlocked gsm phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""verizon"" on the back).  the phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later i got the sim card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).after about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * that was the problem! *  once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  so.....should this happen to your s7 from kiss electronics......when you buy one of these from kiss electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  i do not know if this was kiss electronic's fault or samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been master reset.  once you get the cell, before you do anything to it, i would suggest doing the master reset just to be sure/safe.

this is my wife's galaxy s7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  our carrier required an unlocked gsm phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""verizon"" on the back).  the phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later i got the sim card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).after about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * that was the problem! *  once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  so.....should this happen to your s7 from kiss electronics......when you buy one of these from kiss electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  i do not know if this was kiss electronic's fault or samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been master reset.  once you get the cell, before you do anything to it, i would suggest doing the master reset just to be sure/safe.
i purchased this samsung g7 from what was touted as ""amazon's choice refurbisher"".  i thought i would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  the first problem i saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  the phone would take pictures, and i don't take lots of pictures, so i decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  i need a phone for my business, and i didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.the second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  even in the first month of using the phone, i could seldom get through a day on a charge.  i am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  i just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  i read several articles, and i went in and removed and disabled every app that i could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  i got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.the final straw is that now, in september, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  i am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old samsung g5 in order to get me by (i have to have a phone for my business), until i can order another phone.  of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.the bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" amazon phone.  find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  these phones have been returned because of a problem, and amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.
i purchased the refurbished galaxy s7 for my son's 17th birthday.  it arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  however, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the samsung phones after updating to android 8 (oreo).  we made sure the os and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by samsung to address this issue in the samsung community.  no joy! there are many posts there concerning this issue.  i hope samsung finds a fix soon.  it is otherwise a great phone.fortunately, the seller, buyspry, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  i do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.
do not bother buying one of these! they obviously do not inspect them properly if i was able to notice a very obvious screen defect withing a few hours of owning the phone! they should have caught that and never tried to pass this phone off on anyone!  the first day i got the phone i noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. i did not notice this until i already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so i figured i would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. it proved to be extremely annoying. after a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. it is infuriating because now i won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. this whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and i greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".
great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.
i had to return the phone as it wasn't actually unlocked. it was full of at&t bloatware as well. did not work with republic wireless.
i just bought that phone and it was a present to my sister and now the phone has turned out to be a nightmare.
my real rating would be about 3.75 stars if i could give that.  i used the phone for a week before writing this review.  the ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the home key and the trim at the top.  they aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so i don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  i'm also a little concerned that the usb port is worn.  it doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  so far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  i'm with at&t, moving up from an s5.  i had to get a new sim card (different size) from at&t, which the tech installed for free.  i asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a you tube.  he stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which i believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  problem was, this is an unlocked verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (i'm assuming from verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  i kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  i used samsung's ""smart switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  that worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  battery life seems good.  i'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  it took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  a nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  i got 2.5 years out of my refurbished s5, which still works although is getting quirky.  if this one lasts as long i'll have no complaints.

my real rating would be about 3.75 stars if i could give that.  i used the phone for a week before writing this review.  the ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the home key and the trim at the top.  they aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so i don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  i'm also a little concerned that the usb port is worn.  it doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  so far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  i'm with at&t, moving up from an s5.  i had to get a new sim card (different size) from at&t, which the tech installed for free.  i asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a you tube.  he stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which i believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  problem was, this is an unlocked verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (i'm assuming from verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  i kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  i used samsung's ""smart switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  that worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  battery life seems good.  i'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  it took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  a nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  i got 2.5 years out of my refurbished s5, which still works although is getting quirky.  if this one lasts as long i'll have no complaints.
so! after not getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my plain cardboard box this phone came in, i took it back to jamaica where my ""gsm unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (meaning it is not unlocked). i have bought gsm unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in jamaica, but not this one. after requesting an unlock code from at&t, only to be told that ""this device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".i want all of my money back, and i deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.
failed in less than two months. battery is losing charge fast. screen started flickering and phone started automatically deleting data without user doing anything to cause it.
this is my wife's galaxy s7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  our carrier required an unlocked gsm phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""verizon"" on the back).  the phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later i got the sim card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).after about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * that was the problem! *  once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  so.....should this happen to your s7 from kiss electronics......when you buy one of these from kiss electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  i do not know if this was kiss electronic's fault or samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been master reset.  once you get the cell, before you do anything to it, i would suggest doing the master reset just to be sure/safe.
i purchased this samsung g7 from what was touted as ""amazon's choice refurbisher"".  i thought i would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  the first problem i saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  the phone would take pictures, and i don't take lots of pictures, so i decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  i need a phone for my business, and i didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.the second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  even in the first month of using the phone, i could seldom get through a day on a charge.  i am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  i just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  i read several articles, and i went in and removed and disabled every app that i could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  i got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.the final straw is that now, in september, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  i am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old samsung g5 in order to get me by (i have to have a phone for my business), until i can order another phone.  of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.the bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" amazon phone.  find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  these phones have been returned because of a problem, and amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.
i purchased the refurbished galaxy s7 for my son's 17th birthday.  it arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  however, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the samsung phones after updating to android 8 (oreo).  we made sure the os and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by samsung to address this issue in the samsung community.  no joy! there are many posts there concerning this issue.  i hope samsung finds a fix soon.  it is otherwise a great phone.fortunately, the seller, buyspry, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  i do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.
do not bother buying one of these! they obviously do not inspect them properly if i was able to notice a very obvious screen defect withing a few hours of owning the phone! they should have caught that and never tried to pass this phone off on anyone!  the first day i got the phone i noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. i did not notice this until i already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so i figured i would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. it proved to be extremely annoying. after a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. it is infuriating because now i won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. this whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and i greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".
great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.

do not bother buying one of these! they obviously do not inspect them properly if i was able to notice a very obvious screen defect withing a few hours of owning the phone! they should have caught that and never tried to pass this phone off on anyone!  the first day i got the phone i noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. i did not notice this until i already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so i figured i would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. it proved to be extremely annoying. after a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. it is infuriating because now i won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. this whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and i greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".
great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.
i had to return the phone as it wasn't actually unlocked. it was full of at&t bloatware as well. did not work with republic wireless.
i just bought that phone and it was a present to my sister and now the phone has turned out to be a nightmare.
my real rating would be about 3.75 stars if i could give that.  i used the phone for a week before writing this review.  the ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the home key and the trim at the top.  they aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so i don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  i'm also a little concerned that the usb port is worn.  it doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  so far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  i'm with at&t, moving up from an s5.  i had to get a new sim card (different size) from at&t, which the tech installed for free.  i asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a you tube.  he stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which i believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  problem was, this is an unlocked verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (i'm assuming from verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  i kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  i used samsung's ""smart switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  that worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  battery life seems good.  i'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  it took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  a nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  i got 2.5 years out of my refurbished s5, which still works although is getting quirky.  if this one lasts as long i'll have no complaints.
so! after not getting a charger nor a pair of headphones in my plain cardboard box this phone came in, i took it back to jamaica where my ""gsm unlocked"" phone asks me for a network unlock code (meaning it is not unlocked). i have bought gsm unlocked devices before and they work perfectly in jamaica, but not this one. after requesting an unlock code from at&t, only to be told that ""this device isn't eligible to be unlocked now because all of the payments have not been paid"".i want all of my money back, and i deter anyone from buying this device from this seller.
failed in less than two months. battery is losing charge fast. screen started flickering and phone started automatically deleting data without user doing anything to cause it.
this is my wife's galaxy s7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  our carrier required an unlocked gsm phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""verizon"" on the back).  the phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later i got the sim card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).after about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * that was the problem! *  once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  so.....should this happen to your s7 from kiss electronics......when you buy one of these from kiss electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  i do not know if this was kiss electronic's fault or samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been master reset.  once you get the cell, before you do anything to it, i would suggest doing the master reset just to be sure/safe.

failed in less than two months. battery is losing charge fast. screen started flickering and phone started automatically deleting data without user doing anything to cause it.
this is my wife's galaxy s7....bought it for her as mine has been such a great phone.  our carrier required an unlocked gsm phone, which this one is (it's labeled with ""verizon"" on the back).  the phone booted perfectly, and got connected to our router and email systems with ease.  4 days later i got the sim card , and once installed, the cell got stuck trying to work through some process....and it just sat there spinning and said ""processing........please wait"" for up to 30 minutes (did this many times).after about 20 minutes of trying several fixes by a customer service rep, they thought that perhaps the phone was only ""factory reset"" and not ""master reset"".  * that was the problem! *  once that was done, everything worked perfectly.  so.....should this happen to your s7 from kiss electronics......when you buy one of these from kiss electronics as we did, keep this scenario in mind.  i do not know if this was kiss electronic's fault or samsung's, but in any case, the cell should have been master reset.  once you get the cell, before you do anything to it, i would suggest doing the master reset just to be sure/safe.

i purchased this samsung g7 from what was touted as ""amazon's choice refurbisher"".  i thought i would get a phone in good working order, not fraught with pre-existing conditions.  the first problem i saw when unpacking was that the glass cover over the camera was broken.  the phone would take pictures, and i don't take lots of pictures, so i decided to keep the phone even with this issue.  i need a phone for my business, and i didn't want to take the week delay that returning and getting another phone would take.the second problem was that it became quickly apparent that they didn't change out the battery in the ""refurbishment"" process.  even in the first month of using the phone, i could seldom get through a day on a charge.  i am not a huge internet surfer, or even one to spend more than an hour or so on the phone each day.  i just use it for keeping up with my emails and, by millenial standards, low level texting.  i read several articles, and i went in and removed and disabled every app that i could in order to make sure the problem wasn't some sort of background use of the battery.  even doing that, the situation continued to deteriorate to the point of the battery only lasting a few hours.  i got an external battery, and just kept the phone connected to that in order to be able to use the phone.  again, it was painfully obvious that the ""refurbisher"" neither change the battery , nor even checked to see if the battery was shot before reselling the phone.the final straw is that now, in september, 5 months after purchasing the phone, the display has gone out and the phone is now completely un-useable.  i am now spending my weekend to move my stuff over to my old samsung g5 in order to get me by (i have to have a phone for my business), until i can order another phone.  of course there is no warranty protection for this phone, even covering it for 5 months.the bottom line is - don't buy a ""refurbished"" amazon phone.  find a lesser expensive phone that you can afford that is new.  these phones have been returned because of a problem, and amazon is simply selling them as-is to unsuspecting customers.
i purchased the refurbished galaxy s7 for my son's 17th birthday.  it arrived in excellent physical condition and is really a beautiful piece of hardware.  however, we immediately realized a battery charging issue.  basically the phone would only fully charge in safemode.  out of safemode, it would quickly run down with any activity.  unfortunately, this appears to be a very common issue with the samsung phones after updating to android 8 (oreo).  we made sure the os and apps were up to date, recalibrated the battery meter, and implemented the battery saving measures pointed out by samsung to address this issue in the samsung community.  no joy! there are many posts there concerning this issue.  i hope samsung finds a fix soon.  it is otherwise a great phone.fortunately, the seller, buyspry, was very responsive and refunded the purchase after all means of remedy were exhausted.  i do not fault the seller as this is an issue even with brand new phones.
do not bother buying one of these! they obviously do not inspect them properly if i was able to notice a very obvious screen defect withing a few hours of owning the phone! they should have caught that and never tried to pass this phone off on anyone!  the first day i got the phone i noticed the top 1/3 of the screen was lighter than that bottom 2/3. i did not notice this until i already transferred all my data and got a new sim card so i figured i would just try to get used to it instead of going through the trouble of getting a new phone. it proved to be extremely annoying. after a few weeks of having the phone the volume down button became stuck and now it is stuck in safe mode. it is infuriating because now i won't be able to transfer everything to a new phone. this whole refurbished journey has been a huge headache and i greatly regret trusting that these people actually got the phone to ""look and function as new"".
great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.
i had to return the phone as it wasn't actually unlocked. it was full of at&t bloatware as well. did not work with republic wireless.
i just bought that phone and it was a present to my sister and now the phone has turned out to be a nightmare.

great phone, was indeed unlocked. i use it with my ultra sim card with no issues. it came in plastic wraps, with charger and some booklets (which i didn't read of course:). the phone was in initial setup mode. tip 1: when first inserting sim card, do not insert any memory chip. my phone hanged when i put in sim and chip. but when i removed the memory card, initial setup went ok. after that i could insert memory card and it was reading it. tip 2: this phone (galaxy s7) has a slot for sim card and memory chip that is opened by pressing into a tiny hole. i don't think a special key (a thin wire stick) came with my phone, but i asked one at an ultra shop. my phone was marked as verizon, which i know are difficult to unlock, but it was unlocked ok. fast delivery. p.s. i bought from store buyspry.
i had to return the phone as it wasn't actually unlocked. it was full of at&t bloatware as well. did not work with republic wireless.
i just bought that phone and it was a present to my sister and now the phone has turned out to be a nightmare.
my real rating would be about 3.75 stars if i could give that.  i used the phone for a week before writing this review.  the ad describes as ""looks and works like new"".  not quite, the glass and back are fine but there are a couple of very obvious scratches on the home key and the trim at the top.  they aren't awful and the phone still looks pretty good so i don't really care, just pointing out the discrepancy.  i'm also a little concerned that the usb port is worn.  it doesn't connect properly using a couple of cables that work fine with other devices and you have to pay close attention to the charging cable to get that hooked up right.  so far not a real problem unless it gets worse.  switching phones was not as effortless as they'd like you to believe.  i'm with at&t, moving up from an s5.  i had to get a new sim card (different size) from at&t, which the tech installed for free.  i asked him about the initialization procedure the seller explains in a you tube.  he stated it wasn't necessary as the phone would do it automatically, which i believe it did since it started getting texts and calls right away.  problem was, this is an unlocked verizon phone and it also started looking for updates (i'm assuming from verizon that it could no longer access) which effectively blocked out all other functions.  i kept futzing with it, doing restarts and getting into the settings before it could lock up and finally got it working right (still not sure how, maybe it fixed itself....).  i used samsung's ""smart switch"" to transfer my data and apps.  that worked reasonably well but somehow skipped over a few apps that compete with samsung's bloat-ware (imagine that!).  battery life seems good.  i'm a fairly light user and am getting a couple of days out of a charge if careful.  summing up, not quite ""brand new"" but decent enough looking if you aren't anal.  it took a few hours of work to get it functioning right, actually no better or worse than expected.  a nice phone for the money, especially compared to the price of a new one.  i got 2.5 years out of my refurbished s5, which still works although is getting quirky.  if this one lasts as long i'll have no complaints.
the s8 plus is very nice.  the screen is great and the phone is fast, responsive and well designed.  a decent wired headset and fast charger is included.  i am getting good battery life.  my only complaint is the apps that come with the phone and can’t be uninstalled.  this is especially true of the bixby app which i don’t use.  it has a dedicated button which i disabled.  the voice dictation doesn’t work as well as the google dictation.  fortunately it can be changed to use google by default.
i bought 2 of these and so far they're working great. i had to give a 4 rating because they took about 3 weeks to reach me. not sure what happened with the shipping. i also had trouble getting 1 of them to set up. it came up as t-mobile and refused to recognize my verizon card. it took me hours to get it to work. i had to factory reset and keep restarting the phone over and over before it recognized it as a verizon card. as far as the phones go they came factory packaged and appeared to be brand new. no complaints there! make sure to check with your carrier before buying and see if they use gsm or cdma. buy the wrong phone and it will not work!
the s8 is a great phone. i got this for my girlfriend for her birthday and i was worried it would be annoying to get activated on her verizon account. i was completely wrong: she took her sim card out of her iphone 6, put it in her new s8, let the phone finish its initial setup, and that was literally it. she didn't have to even log into her verizon account and register anything, it just worked immediately (i.e. she could send texts and calls and use her 4g network when wifi was turned off). very impressive.pros:- instant setup without any hassle or contacting verizon. didn't need to contact or even login to verizon (already had a sim card from another verizon phone)- fast, great screen, android, great camera, expandable disk space, slim, gorgeous- powerful enough to emulate ps1 games- still has a dedicated headphone jackcons:- dedicated bixby (virtual assistant that i don't care to learn) button that can only be disabled not reprogrammed- inserting sim and sd card works via a flimsy insert that pops out the top. fortunately you only likely have to do this once or twice
i read the good, the bad, the ugly reviews and took my chances. 2-day shipping, little scratches on the box but at least the phone was in there. i activated the new t-mobile sim card with my existing account and all my data from my old galaxy phone got transferred smoothly. the phone has a great sleek modern look and feel, no problems with it.
arrived quickly, took to att for activation with absolutely no problem. i was in and out in less than 30 minutes including adding changes to my account. phone is a nice size, display very clear. my only con is that the font sizes are not great and don't allow too much adjustment. with a bigger screen, this is harder to read texts on than my galaxy 5. i will play with the screen zoom and fonts, may see if i can download one that works better for me. overall it's very nice, and a definite upgrade. glad i stayed with galaxy.
so i ordered the samsung galaxy s8 unlocked 64gb-us model  g950u midnight black us warranty. used in good conditions retailed for $519.00 plus tax . it shipped amazon prime and it arrived via fedex. presentation and packaging was nice i expected a crappy box but it came in a nicely detailed android smartphone device box.  so when i turned on the phone i was worried because it had a verizon smart up menu and when we inserted our metro pcs sim card it read "" not a verizon sim card"" anyways so i went to metro pcs decided to get a new sim card because mines was old anyways and then they asked if the galaxy s8 phone was unlocked i said yes, the guy was kinda rude and said some features are not going to work properly it seems like no carrier wants to activate unlocked phones these days anyways he set it up. i got home and checked my main features i use like, casting to tv, wifi, browser & youtube sharing, messaging, messaging sharing, bluetooth, wireless charging, sharing, phone calls, google chrome, google home everything worked perfectly so maybe its just the feautures offered from the verizon network.
where do i even begin? this is advertised as a new 64gb black samsung galaxy s8. what i received was a 32gb gold samsung galaxy s7 edge inside of a s8 box. not to mention the front and back of the phone were both shattered - and the cherry on top? there was a little ""don't open if this seal is broken"" sticker on it. it would be hilarious if it didn't cost me $400. i'll be putting this straight back in the box to return it, but it's tough to fight the urge to toss it in the trash.this is a complete waste of money and this seller is a blatant scammer.  i saw some other negative comments and thought ""surely it will work out anyway, i know what i'm doing."" i suspect the positive comments were posted by bots, shills of some sort or by the seller themself. please save yourself the time and money and don't fall for this like i did.pics so you can laugh at my misfortune.
bought this to use as part of my verizon account.  obtained a sim card from the verizon store and they activated it successfully.  this is an at&t phone and comes with an at&t sim card.  it does work on the verizon network but the at&t logo is all over it including the built-in at&t apps.  the built-in apps can be disabled but not deleted.  the time did not want to sync but that may change with updates.  i gave it 4 stars because they could be more up-front that it is at&t.  the galaxy s8 is a great phone.  so far, it is worth the $400 savings over getting it from verizon.  only time will tell.
i was skeptic about buying this because i wasn't sure it would work with my phone plan (ihave boost mobile). plus the phone was used and i was worried about what condition it would actually be in once i've gotten it. once i received the phone it looked brand new not 1 scratch on it. boost couldn't activate it though so i became a little discouraged. the girl that worked at boost told me i could go to sprint and they would help me for a fee. i went to sprint to get the sims card that boost does not carry on hand. they would have had to order it. so i went to sprint gave them the info on the sim card i needed. they were able to help me and the sims card ended up being free. setup was easy after that. i just needed to put my info into the phone and less then 5 minutes it was up and running. i love that the phone came with a warranty. i purchased the phone october 2018 and i called samsung to find out how much longer the warranty was good for. they told me august of next year. i do have two cons about my purchase #1 being it doesn't come with a charger and #2 it doesn't come with the fancy headphones that the s8 comes with. overall i'm please with my purchase.
i got tired of being forcibly throttled by ios.  i had an iphone 7 and like my ipad air 2 both seem to be running slower and slower regardless of actions taken to remedy.i decided to go back to android.this s8+ could redeem android for me as prior android phones were slow, laggy, and poor performers that proved unreliable.  this phone is fast, works smooth with minimal issue and most importantly, is reliable. unfortunately some of the little, insignificant things have not been resolved but functionality is much higher than with my iphone 7.of course, it is still early on, if i have any issues, i will update my review as usual.
i've had a samsungs since high school. it is just easier to use and i know how they work. i like the slickness, the volume, and the picture quality. i am a simple person and i don't generally find out everything that my new technology does but the samsung has prompted me to do just about everything it could possibly do. also, it being unlocked worked out. i thought it was going to be a hassle but i walked right into at&t and they had my new phone and new service up and running within 30 minutes. great buy in my opinion. being a prime member was worth it in the end also because it arrived on sunday as promised. the only thing the us post office service dropped this very expensive device at the door without knocking to let anyone know it was there! as opposed to ups or fedex they don't bother to get you to sign. i would advice using one of the amazon mailbox stations at the qt gas station or where ever they are closest to your location. much safer.
the us warranty listed is not valid.  when i received my phone, i tried to register it on the samsung website and received the error message: ""possible reasons for the error include serial/imei number is not valid, product is older than 3 years, product was purchased outside the u.s.""contacted amazon, and a replacement phone was sent out.  when i attempted to register it, i had the same problem.  after spending an hour with samsung customer service per the number in the warranty listing, the phone does not have a us warranty available.
this product is not us version nor having any us warranty. also model number mentioned is different than mentioned in phone settings. amazon should blacklist this type of sellers. (vipoutlet). if this is mistake by amazon, amazon should be sued for manipulation. when i tried to register this phone, i got following message:""possible reasons for the error include serial/imei number is not valid, product is older than 3 years, product was purchased outside the u.s.""
it's a samsung so i live it. i got this to replace my s7 that was terrible,and battery life as super low.i was thinking about getting the s9 with sprint,but their prices are insane and the s9 has not much difference from the s8 other the finger print scanner button, new processor and new camera. it is not worth the price and the monthly payment to the carrier. i decided to get a unlocked s8 and not own them a penny what's great. it works with sprint just fine, i highly recommend you to buy your own phone than deal with these carrier financing scam.
i love the look and functionality of this phone. it's got plenty of internal storage and a slot for my memory chip. i'm not thrilled with the charging port, all my micro usb chargers are now useless, and the battery life is not amazing. my old phone, a cheap samsung j3, had a 12 hour battery life. usually, far longer. even so, i love this phone and it did come with an attachment to convert one of my micro usb car chargers into a compatible charger, so... ultimately, a great purchase. i'll just have to charge it on long work days.
i bought this in september of 2017 and absolutely loved it. then they pushed an update for oreo about 6 months ago which caused the phone to no longer allow bluetooth control of streaming services through my vehicles head unit. i waited for a fix. i looked online, and tried everything from factory resets to changing developer mode settings, updating the firmware on the head unit, contacting pandora's tech support. samsung's solution is for me to send it (my only active phone) in, and wait a week or two with no phone so they can send me a refurbished one... with no guarantee that it will fix the issue. yep, i send them a phone that was purchased new, go without a phone for two weeks, and then they'll send me back a 'refurbished' phone potentially with a scratched up screen and poor battery, that will likely not fix the issue since it is clearly a software problem. i used to swear by samsung, but i can no longer recommend samsung to anyone based on my s8 not working properly for 2/3 of the time i've owned it. i currently own the following samsung devices, galaxy s3, s4, s5, s6, s7, s8, gear, gear s nano, samsung refrigerator, and a curved 4k tv. i say this so you know how much i have enjoyed samsung in the past. if they release an update that breaks something, their expectation is that you'll just go buy a new one - i've given them 6 months to fix what they broke in the oreo update and they haven't done it... they haven't had any trouble though pushing their new phone. no thanks. now as items stop working i will make sure to avoid samsung.
the samsung galaxy s8 i was shipped had model number sm-g950f, which is the international version of the phone, not the us version as specified in this item.i recently got lines of dead pixels in my s8 and samsung refuses to pay for it because the international version of the phone does not have a warranty coverage as promised in this item.
what i like the most about the phone is that it was a unlocked phone but when i had it activated by t-mobile it work fine for a day unlimited data,talk, and texted. the second day i got a notice in notification screen that it needed a verizon sim card ,the phone became useless no talk no text. i reboot the phone and notice at start up a verizon start up screen a peers.  is the phone locked or unlocked as advertised?
i was skeptical about buying this phone off amazon instead of verizon because the reviews were half good, half bad as far as activating it on the verizon network.  my advice is dont go to the store and activate yourself on their website.  it takes just 5-10 minutes.  just make sure to have a verizon nano sim card, i was able to use the one from my iphone 6.  transfer your contacts, music etc on their app as well, it's very easy.  other than that the actual phone is great.  very sleek looking phone.  this phone is $756 at verizon and they try to sell their payment plan to you but i would much rather pay the cheaper amazon price and keep my phone bill lower.  if you're on the fence like i was i hope this review can help you out.
this review is coming from a long time apple user. after years of drink the koolaid i decided to make a change.upgrading from the apple ecosystem isn't easy as it is a big change but this phone is incredible. it may not be a 2018 flagship but it is still great.camera: the 12 megapixel camera is clear and bright. it does not take the best low light pictures but as good if not better than other flagship of 2017. in daylight this camera shines and is excellent.screen: samsung has a always had the best quality smartphone screens. the infinity display is something to get used to but the super sampled display is no different. the colors are bright and vibrant. when the display is set to 1440p (factory defaults the display to 1080p) is crystal clear and watching videos or photos it will blow your mind if you compare it to comparable smartphones.design: the infinity display and glad back are a very elegant design, while allowing for great features and one not so great.features: this phone most of the features of 2018 flagships. fingerprint scanner, face unlock and iris scanner. the only thing is the placement of the fingerprint scanner is in less than a desirable location. being right next to the camera lens it is very easy to smudge it when reaching for it, but the face unlock is very reliable and extremely fast so you have options.due to the glass back the s8 has wireless charging alongside samsung's fast charging system allows for easy and fast charging anywhere.hardware: the snapdragon 835 with gigs of ram may not be the latest and greatest but for multitasking and everyday tasks are seemless. gaming is also fast and smooth. it's no razor phone or note 9 but it is more than capable.all in all this is  great smartphone and is defintly worth your consideration if you can't stomach 1000$ for a phone.
just after my support ended, my screen seems to have begun having a hardware issue. horizontal lines have begun appearing, and it looks to be a hardware issue. pretty disappointed that the amazon support does not last longer considering i've seen multiple posts online about this being an issue. i haven't had any drops or water issues with the phone, so it looks like the amoled screens become defective after a certain time potentially.  note that if you contact samsung about this, they will require you to send your phone back, which can be a problem if you do not have another phone to use during that time. buyer beware!
i am honestly astounded by how beautiful and advance this phone is. coming from an iphone 6s, this is truly an upgrade worth getting for the price.firstly, the screen is absolutely the best you can get on the market on any phone right now. it has a beautiful 5.8"" quad hd+ super amoled (2960x1440 resolution). this makes the colors, contrast, and blacks more vivid and pure.  the pure black is pixels turned off when they aren't needed. this gives an amazing black color and helps a bit with the battery not needing to display extra pixels. the screen also employs samsung's ""infinity display"". this creates a nearly bezel-less design on the front screen which gives can provide more information on the screen. they have removed their physical buttons, but it's really noticeable after a few minutes. a feature that i have come to use quite a bit (with widgets and fast opening of certain apps) is the edge. i am very glad they've introduced the edge screen onto the regular s series. if you don't prefer it, you can also turn it off. samsung has also added an always on display. this shows the date and time along with notifications you receive. this doesn't consume hardly any battery life (with only losing around 1% an hour)software: out of the box, it runs android 7.0 (nougat). it also does come with samsung's 'controversial' touchwiz skin. however, they've greatly improved the experience and fluidity of the software. i have not noticed any lag with using it for some time now. it's responsive and i personally enjoy the look of it. you can always download different launchers to your liking. s8 users should be able to get andriod 8.0 (oreo) within early next month.hardware: this phone sports 64gb (along with microsd slot of up to 256gb of expandable storage) and 4gb of ram. i am really happy with the amount of ram and space that's offered. with my iphone, i've always had to load up the pages i was on again due to the low ram, along with the very disappointing 16gb of space (12gb in usable). this limited to using my old phone for daily news and chat apps, while hardly being able to play many games. this is definitely not an issue with the s8! i've downloaded many things that i previously couldn't and i still have a beast amount of storage left. it's also ip68 certified dust and water resistant.charging: i love the adaptive fast charge that samsung offers for their products. it charges my phone quickly without it getting hot. the battery capacity is 3000mah and fast for hours. i can go around 4-6 hours of screen on time while going around 12 hours in general. i am very happy with this as regular charging seems quite dated to have it on any (premium) phone.camera: this camera is truly beautiful and very detailed. i am surprised by how much i am using it. the photos are clear and crisp all with just one snap. selfies are also detailed and great to look at. 8mp af for front and dual pixel 12mp af for the rear.security: the s8 employs two different biometrics for unlocking your phone (along with the regular number/line password). the one we've known for some time is the fingerprint scanner (to which they have moved it right next to the camera. this is not a preferable location as i do hit the camera often) and the new iris scanner. the iris scanner has been quite convenient, though you do have to be a bit close (and in light) for it to work.voice command: samsung has added a new 'bixby' to their phone line that is to be used similarly to amazon's alexa, apple's siri, and google's assistant. there is a dedicated button on the left side of the phone that allows for bixby to hear your voice for your questions/command. this button will also open bixby home, which shows some news, events, personal widgets, and bixby 'levels'. that is right, you can increase the levels gained on bixby by using it and helping it with feedback. this doesn't lock you behind any level requirements to use it to the full. this only allows customization unlocks. this has been a controversial feature so far (as many find it unnecessary), though i have been fairly enjoying it. i really use it for screenshots. if you don't prefer it, there are apps to redirect the bixby button to use it for other apps.overall, the experience is astounding and i wouldn't trade it for anything else really. this is a phone that will feel premium for years to come. if you're holding out, don't wait! it's an experience unlike any other.note: i have covered the broad specs of the s8, however there are also smaller details that you can view on samsung's homepage if you want all the specs and information.
i read the reviews and i needed a waterproof phone.  i've only had this for a few days so far and still getting used to why it makes noises at different times.  it told me ""it appears you go to bed around 0030, do you want to enter in plans for tomorrow now?""  or something to that effect at 6pm today.  that is a little creepy to me.  these are supposed to be phones, communication devices not creeper tracking you.i truly believe the prices for these ""smartphones"" are between insane and stupid (over $500 for this one and iphones run close enough to $1000), but times are a changing and we all ""need"" to stay connected with these little devices.the camera works really well on this phone as it takes nice, sharp photos.  it was a bit of a challenge to transfer my contacts from a non samsung phone to this one.  just export your contacts to a micro sd card from your old phone and put in the new s8.  it only took a short time to bring all the info over to the new phone.
at first i was thinking ""am i nuts for spending 600 bucks on a phone?"" well sanity not withstanding, i am happy with my new phone.i use it with my tracfone account. so it is cheap for me to maintain for the year. it's nice not having a phone that is locked to any specific carrier.and the functionality of the s8 is great. i like the biometric features. the dex functionality is a bonus. i didn't even know about it at the time i bought it. the built in device maintenance means i don't have to run an app that bombards me with ads just to clean the phones os.the bad.samsung bixby. i don't have a problem with everyone trying to come up with their own digital assistant software. but it should be optional not forced. in order to disable it on the phone, first you have to agree with the license. not happy about having to agree to let someone in my house in order to be able to tell them to get out.samsung pay. no you cannot hold my wallet.samsung health. stop shoving advertising in my face.but other than that, i love the phone.
verizon could not activate phone because it is not usa version. i took all precautions by purchasing phone case and screen protector. placed protector and all on phone out of box. now i have to return all. just a waste of my time and money. now why sell a phone in the usa if it's for united arab!!! this is a scam. buyer beware!!
great phone! good touchscreen response. great camera, ect, etc. would have been perfect if they had packaged the right one. i don't live in freaking europe. samsung fail, not amazon. the box listed the model as sm-g950u1 (usa version). inside, factory sealed, was sm-g950f (international version). the imei number even matched. how could this error possibly happen?!? it cost me half a day dealing with verizon trying to figure out what the problem was.pissed
i bought two cellphones, my wife cellphone is still working great. but my cellphone had a software problem since the beginning, everytime i tried to update the software it showed an error. last week i installed samsung smart switch on my pc to back up my files, it showed me the option that i could update the software through this app, but after a while it just took me to a blue screen, now my cellphone is useless, it doesnt accept the emergency software recovery or any other option. i will try to get the warranty.
was supposed to be unlocked and compatible with cellular/data programs offered by, among other major providers, verizon.  well, it wasn't.  finally took it to a verizon store and was told that the phone was simply not compatible with verizon. so frustrating! it's so obvious the answer is the best course of action is to go to a provider brick and mortar store (in this case verizon), and buy the phone there.  whatever the difference in price is, if any, is more than offset by the time and hassle saved. ugh!
ordered this device while harvey was ongoing. there was a slight delay, but that was inevitable due to the inclement weather. arrived within the time frame and amazon notified me, as and when there were delays.the device was grouped with the case and screen protector that i had ordered, which was very convenient. packaging was secure which is expected for this device at such a price range.overall, the phone is brilliant. sharp display, clear camera images with af. it runs all apps like a breeze and is well suited for heavy multitasking. the bezel-less display is a joy to look at and reading on it is very comfortable. it also ships with usb (b to c) and (a to c) adapters, which helps during our transition to usb c type plugs.the battery life is amazing, for a phone with such a sharp and bright display, and also considering the hardware. the 3500mah battery offers enough juice for an entire day of light usage. heavy use - like watching movies or playing games like real racing, etc. drains it faster, but that is expected from demanding apps.the issue of the fingerprint sensor being too close to the camera is real for the first few days; but after using it as your daily driver, you tend to figure out where it is and it doesn't pose much of a bother, unless you deliberately want to smudge your camera lens.i would highly recommend this device to anyone with a moderately high budget. it looks amazing and performs much better than it looks. i would also recommend to get a protector case (the rear side is a fingerprint magnet and you wouldn't want to crack this amazing display) and a screen protector. to all those having second thoughts, i would say: go for it!
7 mounth after  buyingterrible purchase regret it will never buy a samsung device in my life !!!!battery life the worst ever phone needs to be charge 3 to 4 times a daycharging port doesn't work any more !!!phone has to be charged with wireless chargerphone heats up while chargingphone is slow since day one !!!use to have galaxy s 7 edge, and to be honest it feels like i downgrade to s8 just stay away samsung's customer service are not willing to do anything but to make me send my phone without giving me any loan phone or device to use in the meantime just doesn't make sensemy suggestion samsung learn from apple!!!!
i did buy this phone new and from amazon just fyinow i know the quality of the product has nothing to do with amazon so this rating is obviously for the product specifically.i even noticed that someone had the same problem with the phone that i did.it completely died after owning it for about 3 months. i did not do anything to the phone other than add a micro sd card (which is allowed with this device) and it worked fine ever since i bought it.however amazons warranty is not so great. samsung does offer a 1 year manufacturers warranty on new items. the csr (customer support representative) was helpful and straight forward. you do have to ship the phone to them, but they will email you a paid for shipping label (print 3 to place on 3 sides of the box). excluding the shipping time, maintenance and processing will take 9-11 business days. obviously no one should have to deal with this in the first place, but i just want a helpful review if someone has a bad situation happen to them like i did. samsung's csr is 866-371-9501. follow the menu prompts and you will get the option to speak to a csr (it can get annoying waiting through all the options but you'll get there)
the us warranty listed is not valid.  when i received my phone, i tried to register it on the samsung website and received the error message: ""possible reasons for the error include serial/imei number is not valid, product is older than 3 years, product was purchased outside the u.s.""contacted amazon, and a replacement phone was sent out.  when i attempted to register it, i had the same problem.  after spending an hour with samsung customer service per the number in the warranty listing, the phone does not have a us warranty available.
very disappointed with this purchase. no us warranty!since i opened the box, the phone came with vertical marks on both edges. very light marks but noticeable with the screen off.i passed that issue, but two days ago the screen glass broke on the botton edge without any apparent reason.i took the phone to an authorized shop to change the glass and the attendant told that it is an international  version and don’t have warranty in the us. really disappointed with this phone.don’t know how amazon let this type of products are sold in this site.
the good: i'm really glad that i got this over spending more for a verizon phone. there's less garbage on it from the carrier (and the few things that it tried to install when i inserted the sim card were able to be uninstalled). the battery life is pretty crazy. even without the power saver mode turned on, it lasts all day. switch on power saver mode and it won't use hardly any power unless the screen is turned on. the curved screen doesn't cause issues with the touch screen while using it one-handed, and is positively gorgeous. people actually ask me what phone i have. the camera is super fast and takes amazing pictures.the bad: bixby is not what it's cracked up to be in my opinion. sure it can do some cool stuff, but 90% of the time it's not helpful. additionally, there's a really quick, perceptible wait for the microphone to turn on when you hold the button down. i also tend to push the button (or it gets pushed as it's going into my pocket) on accident. for some reason when i type the microphone key on the keyboard to do voice dictation, it refuses to use the google voice recognition engine. it's not really slick so it won't fall out of your hand, but when i put it screen down on my nightstand, there's some coating or something on the screen that will actually let the phone slowly slide around (because the table isn't 100% level).
this is a samsung phone. it came with at&t instruction book.the description stated it was a us unlocked phone and it is not.the phone came and the default language was dutch. had to use google to translate so i could get it set.the phone will only only use 3g and 2g. 4g is not available.do not purchase this phone if you are expecting a us version. amazon should prevent fraudulent vendors like this from selling on their site.
read my review before make your decision!!!!!!!!!i have purchased the s8 from this seller for around 5 months only. i have never dropped the device, never done any physical damage to the device, never done anything to the operating system. then when i was using the cellphone for fun, suddenly it shows an problem: device storage corrupted.therefore, considering this device is still under us one-year warranty, as the seller states in the product description, i contacted samsung service and sent the s8 to repair. however, samsung repair center told me that the motherboard of this device is replaced, therefore, it is out of warranty... i am not sure if the seller has an explanation on this?if not, i can only suspect that the seller has done something to the device. then do not buy anything from the seller! it will not be under the warranty if there is any problem!!! the samsung would say it is not from official sellers, they won't be responsible for it!!!
i bought this in september of 2017 and absolutely loved it. then they pushed an update for oreo about 6 months ago which caused the phone to no longer allow bluetooth control of streaming services through my vehicles head unit. i waited for a fix. i looked online, and tried everything from factory resets to changing developer mode settings, updating the firmware on the head unit, contacting pandora's tech support. samsung's solution is for me to send it (my only active phone) in, and wait a week or two with no phone so they can send me a refurbished one... with no guarantee that it will fix the issue. yep, i send them a phone that was purchased new, go without a phone for two weeks, and then they'll send me back a 'refurbished' phone potentially with a scratched up screen and poor battery, that will likely not fix the issue since it is clearly a software problem. i used to swear by samsung, but i can no longer recommend samsung to anyone based on my s8 not working properly for 2/3 of the time i've owned it. i currently own the following samsung devices, galaxy s3, s4, s5, s6, s7, s8, gear, gear s nano, samsung refrigerator, and a curved 4k tv. i say this so you know how much i have enjoyed samsung in the past. if they release an update that breaks something, their expectation is that you'll just go buy a new one - i've given them 6 months to fix what they broke in the oreo update and they haven't done it... they haven't had any trouble though pushing their new phone. no thanks. now as items stop working i will make sure to avoid samsung.
the samsung galaxy s8 i was shipped had model number sm-g950f, which is the international version of the phone, not the us version as specified in this item.i recently got lines of dead pixels in my s8 and samsung refuses to pay for it because the international version of the phone does not have a warranty coverage as promised in this item.
what i like the most about the phone is that it was a unlocked phone but when i had it activated by t-mobile it work fine for a day unlimited data,talk, and texted. the second day i got a notice in notification screen that it needed a verizon sim card ,the phone became useless no talk no text. i reboot the phone and notice at start up a verizon start up screen a peers.  is the phone locked or unlocked as advertised?
i was skeptical about buying this phone off amazon instead of verizon because the reviews were half good, half bad as far as activating it on the verizon network.  my advice is dont go to the store and activate yourself on their website.  it takes just 5-10 minutes.  just make sure to have a verizon nano sim card, i was able to use the one from my iphone 6.  transfer your contacts, music etc on their app as well, it's very easy.  other than that the actual phone is great.  very sleek looking phone.  this phone is $756 at verizon and they try to sell their payment plan to you but i would much rather pay the cheaper amazon price and keep my phone bill lower.  if you're on the fence like i was i hope this review can help you out.
this review is coming from a long time apple user. after years of drink the koolaid i decided to make a change.upgrading from the apple ecosystem isn't easy as it is a big change but this phone is incredible. it may not be a 2018 flagship but it is still great.camera: the 12 megapixel camera is clear and bright. it does not take the best low light pictures but as good if not better than other flagship of 2017. in daylight this camera shines and is excellent.screen: samsung has a always had the best quality smartphone screens. the infinity display is something to get used to but the super sampled display is no different. the colors are bright and vibrant. when the display is set to 1440p (factory defaults the display to 1080p) is crystal clear and watching videos or photos it will blow your mind if you compare it to comparable smartphones.design: the infinity display and glad back are a very elegant design, while allowing for great features and one not so great.features: this phone most of the features of 2018 flagships. fingerprint scanner, face unlock and iris scanner. the only thing is the placement of the fingerprint scanner is in less than a desirable location. being right next to the camera lens it is very easy to smudge it when reaching for it, but the face unlock is very reliable and extremely fast so you have options.due to the glass back the s8 has wireless charging alongside samsung's fast charging system allows for easy and fast charging anywhere.hardware: the snapdragon 835 with gigs of ram may not be the latest and greatest but for multitasking and everyday tasks are seemless. gaming is also fast and smooth. it's no razor phone or note 9 but it is more than capable.all in all this is  great smartphone and is defintly worth your consideration if you can't stomach 1000$ for a phone.
just after my support ended, my screen seems to have begun having a hardware issue. horizontal lines have begun appearing, and it looks to be a hardware issue. pretty disappointed that the amazon support does not last longer considering i've seen multiple posts online about this being an issue. i haven't had any drops or water issues with the phone, so it looks like the amoled screens become defective after a certain time potentially.  note that if you contact samsung about this, they will require you to send your phone back, which can be a problem if you do not have another phone to use during that time. buyer beware!
i am honestly astounded by how beautiful and advance this phone is. coming from an iphone 6s, this is truly an upgrade worth getting for the price.firstly, the screen is absolutely the best you can get on the market on any phone right now. it has a beautiful 5.8"" quad hd+ super amoled (2960x1440 resolution). this makes the colors, contrast, and blacks more vivid and pure.  the pure black is pixels turned off when they aren't needed. this gives an amazing black color and helps a bit with the battery not needing to display extra pixels. the screen also employs samsung's ""infinity display"". this creates a nearly bezel-less design on the front screen which gives can provide more information on the screen. they have removed their physical buttons, but it's really noticeable after a few minutes. a feature that i have come to use quite a bit (with widgets and fast opening of certain apps) is the edge. i am very glad they've introduced the edge screen onto the regular s series. if you don't prefer it, you can also turn it off. samsung has also added an always on display. this shows the date and time along with notifications you receive. this doesn't consume hardly any battery life (with only losing around 1% an hour)software: out of the box, it runs android 7.0 (nougat). it also does come with samsung's 'controversial' touchwiz skin. however, they've greatly improved the experience and fluidity of the software. i have not noticed any lag with using it for some time now. it's responsive and i personally enjoy the look of it. you can always download different launchers to your liking. s8 users should be able to get andriod 8.0 (oreo) within early next month.hardware: this phone sports 64gb (along with microsd slot of up to 256gb of expandable storage) and 4gb of ram. i am really happy with the amount of ram and space that's offered. with my iphone, i've always had to load up the pages i was on again due to the low ram, along with the very disappointing 16gb of space (12gb in usable). this limited to using my old phone for daily news and chat apps, while hardly being able to play many games. this is definitely not an issue with the s8! i've downloaded many things that i previously couldn't and i still have a beast amount of storage left. it's also ip68 certified dust and water resistant.charging: i love the adaptive fast charge that samsung offers for their products. it charges my phone quickly without it getting hot. the battery capacity is 3000mah and fast for hours. i can go around 4-6 hours of screen on time while going around 12 hours in general. i am very happy with this as regular charging seems quite dated to have it on any (premium) phone.camera: this camera is truly beautiful and very detailed. i am surprised by how much i am using it. the photos are clear and crisp all with just one snap. selfies are also detailed and great to look at. 8mp af for front and dual pixel 12mp af for the rear.security: the s8 employs two different biometrics for unlocking your phone (along with the regular number/line password). the one we've known for some time is the fingerprint scanner (to which they have moved it right next to the camera. this is not a preferable location as i do hit the camera often) and the new iris scanner. the iris scanner has been quite convenient, though you do have to be a bit close (and in light) for it to work.voice command: samsung has added a new 'bixby' to their phone line that is to be used similarly to amazon's alexa, apple's siri, and google's assistant. there is a dedicated button on the left side of the phone that allows for bixby to hear your voice for your questions/command. this button will also open bixby home, which shows some news, events, personal widgets, and bixby 'levels'. that is right, you can increase the levels gained on bixby by using it and helping it with feedback. this doesn't lock you behind any level requirements to use it to the full. this only allows customization unlocks. this has been a controversial feature so far (as many find it unnecessary), though i have been fairly enjoying it. i really use it for screenshots. if you don't prefer it, there are apps to redirect the bixby button to use it for other apps.overall, the experience is astounding and i wouldn't trade it for anything else really. this is a phone that will feel premium for years to come. if you're holding out, don't wait! it's an experience unlike any other.note: i have covered the broad specs of the s8, however there are also smaller details that you can view on samsung's homepage if you want all the specs and information.
this is for the model sm-g950 and sold and fulfilled by amazon.*i bought this phone from amazon directly, so beware of other negative reviews from other shops*so far i love this phone. when it arrived it was clearly brand new in the box, never been touched. it also came with samsung headphones inside the box, even though the option i selected was 'phone only'.  it is lightning fast and the camera is incredible!  it was an easy transition from my old galaxy s5. i am with tmobile and had to go get a micro-sim activated for this phone. never had an issue in compatibility with t-mobile and my overall service coverage actually improved. there is a minimal amount of pre-installed apps which is nice as it won't slow the phone down with unnecessary bloatware.  completely satisfied with my purchase and will update if anything changes.
in less than 8 months, the call volume on this phone no longer works.  after numerous hours on the phone and at an authorized service center, it was determined that it is a manufacturers defect.  customer support from samsung was not helpful.  i have to send the phone back to samsung to be repaired; and although the phone is under warranty samsung support refused to provide a loaner and told me i have to wait 2 weeks for the phone to be repaired.
after my phone started to show it's age (about 5 years old and the battery needed to be constantly charged up during the day). the hunt for a new phone began. after reading a bunch of reviews and going on the various phone forums, i decided to go with the samsung s8+. i had an iphone before and hated it, so, that was not an option.i've had the s8+ for a year now and i couldn't be any happier. the unlocked version was a better buy than getting it from my carrier because samsung sends out updates immediately, while your carrier is a lot slower in rolling out the latest updates. one of the reasons for not getting it from my carrier is the lack of ""bloatware"" that carriers like to add to their phones. my unlocked phone still has a very good battery life (i can go three days without charging my phone). under heavy usage, i can go two days between charges.
wifey's an apple-head ... i'm team samsung ... the debate continues.  she recently upgraded to the iphone 7 plus (red special edition) ... & it's 'nice' ... but when i received my new galaxy s8+, i was instantaneously reminded of the style, quality & excellence that only samsung can deliver.  it's not even close.* fyi ... i purchased a verizon prepaid sim card, as a suggested add-on through amazon after adding the phone to my cart.  the verizon sim card is a 'verizon wireless sim kit prepaid sim card - (moto g & any verizon branded phone)'.  when i attempted to activate the phone w/ sim card through the verizon wireless website, the activation would not complete & verizon claimed i needed a 'samsung' sim car kit.  however, my wife completed the activation steps that accompanied the sim card kit (the instructions on the packaging), & the activation completed flawlessly.
this phone was rated as ""good"" from warehouse deals. when it arrived it was in the factory box and looked like it had never been opened.  the plastic was still on the screen. i found no scratches or imperfections. my carrier is sprint. it is truly unlocked for all carriers.they had me hooked up in about 15 minutes. the clerk asked me if i had bought the phone new from samsung directly. he told me it was the unlocked version that would work internationally too.i have had the phone a couple of weeks and it has performed flawlessly. this was another great buy for me here on amazon. if you are on the fence like i was about upgrading to the s8, go ahead and buy one here, its just an awesome phone. i had an s5 that was great but this s8 is so much better. trust me on this. go ahead and buy it. you will be amazed too!
ordered this device while harvey was ongoing. there was a slight delay, but that was inevitable due to the inclement weather. arrived within the time frame and amazon notified me, as and when there were delays.the device was grouped with the case and screen protector that i had ordered, which was very convenient. packaging was secure which is expected for this device at such a price range.overall, the phone is brilliant. sharp display, clear camera images with af. it runs all apps like a breeze and is well suited for heavy multitasking. the bezel-less display is a joy to look at and reading on it is very comfortable. it also ships with usb (b to c) and (a to c) adapters, which helps during our transition to usb c type plugs.the battery life is amazing, for a phone with such a sharp and bright display, and also considering the hardware. the 3500mah battery offers enough juice for an entire day of light usage. heavy use - like watching movies or playing games like real racing, etc. drains it faster, but that is expected from demanding apps.the issue of the fingerprint sensor being too close to the camera is real for the first few days; but after using it as your daily driver, you tend to figure out where it is and it doesn't pose much of a bother, unless you deliberately want to smudge your camera lens.i would highly recommend this device to anyone with a moderately high budget. it looks amazing and performs much better than it looks. i would also recommend to get a protector case (the rear side is a fingerprint magnet and you wouldn't want to crack this amazing display) and a screen protector. to all those having second thoughts, i would say: go for it!
7 mounth after  buyingterrible purchase regret it will never buy a samsung device in my life !!!!battery life the worst ever phone needs to be charge 3 to 4 times a daycharging port doesn't work any more !!!phone has to be charged with wireless chargerphone heats up while chargingphone is slow since day one !!!use to have galaxy s 7 edge, and to be honest it feels like i downgrade to s8 just stay away samsung's customer service are not willing to do anything but to make me send my phone without giving me any loan phone or device to use in the meantime just doesn't make sensemy suggestion samsung learn from apple!!!!
there is a lot i love about this phone but a handful of things i'm not crazy about. picture quality, sound quality, storage, all of those are great. the bixby button sucks. the location of the button is terrible and i'm constantly hitting it on accident and having bixby take over my screen. i dont use bixby, i can't figure out how to turn the option off (of that's even possible). another thing i dont care for is how easy it is to move apps and folders around on the screen. it seems like at least once a week i look at my phone and some apps/folders are in a different place i have no idea when it happened. lastly, i switched to this phone from an iphone 5, and it seems like my cell service (which didnt change) is way worse. lots of calls going straight to voicemail without my phone ever ringing. i never had that issue on iphone. overall i'm very pleased. the battery life is amazing (kicks the iphone's booty for sure), memory space is amazing (again, kicking booty). i wouldnt go back
im very disappointed with my purchase, i purchase this phone in august and the phone no longer turns on as of november 27 this year.
this phone is dope, it looks cool and it feels cool. some people dont like where the finger print scanner is located but i dont really mind, i got used to it in a day but thats just me. this is one of the best phones i've had, its really fast and you can customize everything!one thing i would like to point out, wich i havent seen any other reviewer talk about, is that when i put my sim card inside the s8 it dint activate my lte service, so this is what i did, grab another phone that has a sim card from your same carrier and copy that phones vpn setting to your s8, it worked for me.id recomend buying a case if you are prone to droping phones like am, but i have a friend that has had her s8+ for 5 months without a case and has not droped it once, but i wouldnt take that chance.edit: i added some pictures of what i did with the vpn, you just have to manually copy the information from another cell phone to your s8, hope this helps.ps.my friend dropped her phone a few days ago lol, buy a case.
this samsung device receives 9.5 from me.  i have had an issue with almost every apple iphone, mostly because of their weak cell receptions.  i was always frustrated with call quality and apps crashing.  also with the last iphone 6s i had owned the battery would always drain once down to around 25%.  this s8+ does not have any of those problems and is phenomenal in performance.  there is no slowdown switching from apps, video and call quality are top notch.  color calibration to app resolution, video games to microsoft apps, whatever you throw at it, it does without difficulty.  call quality, audio and cell reception quite excellent.  i have t mobile service and was worrying that the speed would drop from lte down to 4g or 3.  not once does it drop from lte speeds.  i know many people complain about the 16:9 ratio.  this doesn't bother me.  if you want to use pictures for desktop, just adjust the ratio in camera app.  almost every app is now fitted for the screen ratio and when streaming videos, you can double tap the screen to zoom to fit.  this feature makes the video streaming very very enjoyable.  the only complain i have is with the akg ear phones the phone comes with.  ear buds do not have a good bass.  i ended up using the samsung ear buds instead.  factory unlocked version is definitely worth the price because there are no carrier bloatware on it.  yes!  no more bloatware.
ive loved all my samsung phones except this one.  it freezes up (software issue) and gets super hot.  so extremely expensive to replace glass.. its becaus they can charge alot.  iphone was $80.. my s8 over $300!!
great phone, first unlocked we've ever bought, and it was a great move.  it's great but not perfect.prosexcellent performance with all apps, very snappybeautiful screen (though very delicate)light, great battery lifecons* phone is slippery wherever you touch/grab it.  hard to hold onto, unless you get a case, which you probably should.* bixby assistant is very obtrusive and even has its own dedicated hard button on the left, which you will be mistakenly hitting often (you can sign into samsung and set the button to do nothing, but you can't seem to reassign the button to be useful, or completely get rid of bixby).* edge screen design is a novelty and more difficult to use than a standard screen.  i find myself having to try multiple times to get the right thing selected with my finger, because of the wrapping edges of the screen* doesn't seem to have a widget for flashlight built in, like my s5 had
i ended up going to the hospital and was unable to make the return date of february 3rd.  i have had nothing but problems with this phone.  unlocked is  joke!  voice problems. problems not properly connecting to my carrier. glitches in the speaker system etc.  the phone diverts back to a ""prepaid"" credit card phone status and cannot make outgoing or incoming calls.  i've tried different sim cards and hours worth of tech support to get this phone working.  extremely disappointed.  will try to work with amazon a little bit more to resolve the issue.
i really like this phone, upgraded from a comparatively ancient note 2 and got it last week. the battery life lasts me a bit under two days using it normally with the ""always on"" screen feature, but there are some fancy-looking power saving modes that reduce some of the phone's functionality for significantly longer battery life. i haven't tested them yet though because it hasn't been necessary. i'm sad to see the s pen go, it wasn't worth spending another $350 for the note 8, but i'm impressed by how much smoother the screen looks and feels. the camera is also pretty reasonable. low-light situations are pretty questionable, but for a phone it seems to do a decent job. the camera fares much better in bright indoor lights and outside.the s8 feels pretty light and a bit slick due to how much glass is used in its construction. it's a nice-looking phone, but after having dropped my old one and living with a cracked screen for two years, i took zero chances and put it in an otterbox defender case almost immediately.the software is also quite nice. there's no carrier bloatware on it so you don't have to spend half an hour trying to uninstall and disable apps that you'll never use, but it still comes with most of the basic apps you'll need. samsung clearly put in a lot of effort on the overall aesthetics of the interface too. overall no complaints.my carrier is verizon and it was relatively painless to get the phone set up with them. i just went to one of their locations (not a third-party retailer) and they gave me a sim card for free. i was alone during this so they texted a code to my parents and i called them via a landline phone at the store so they could read it me, and after punching that into the terminal the verizon employee took care of the rest. i recommend using google or verizon's cloud backup or some other software (like samsung kies) to get your contacts before getting the new phone. i forgot to do that so i walked around for two days getting texts from disembodied numbers until i worked it out on my own. set up backups now, my old phone's screen was completely broken (hence the new phone) and the only reason i was able to get my contacts off of it was because the s pen digitizer was still functioning (but nothing else) so i could blindly punch in my pin to unlock the phone.
i have had this phone for several months now.this phone has great specs and does not fail in that regard. it also contains many of the features expected of flagship phones such as waterproofing and wireless charging.with that said, i had 3 concerns when initially purchasing this phone after coming from a nexus 6p.1. phone updates, including upgrades to new versions of android.2. non-stock experience, including many samsung apps already installed.3. single bottom firing speaker.with that said, the first issue is still a concern. updates are slow, especially considering that my previous phone is already on the latest version of android. this is a huge disappointment and will likely prevent me from purchasing another samsung phone again.the second issue has been less of a concern for me. many of the samsung apps add additional functionality that is not found in stock android. they are very usable and are worth giving a try.the third issue is still and issue, but some people have been able to enable stereo functionality, but will require rooting the phone. the speaker is loud, but stereo audio sounds much better.
an all around good phone, with a fast, clean, and well thought out user interface.  a literal life saver, as it ""secret serviced"" a .45 hollow point meant for my femur...i'll elaborate.while i was at the shooting range there was a negligent discharge and the round impacted my left thigh.  fortunately, i kept my galaxy s8 in my front left pocket, and it took the round for me.  the bullet went trough the case smashed the back of the phone dented and deformed some metal plate in the phone and then deflected out of the back of the case and came to rest in the bottom of my pants pocket.i'd post pictures but, well, the s8 didn't make it.  i've been using samsung phones for a few years now with no issues, and now that one has saved my life (probably) i am likely to keep using them.
phone won't call or text even though it says it is connected. try over and over then in an hour or so it will work.the window for returns is way to short for something that costs $500. i sure hope i don't need it to call 911 before i can replace it. if galaxy won't help replace this i don't think i'll ever buy anything form them again.
i was a apple user for the longest time and i decided to try a samsung product. i loved the phone, i thought the phone functioned a lot better then any iphone i had. after about a month of no issues at all, the phone just stopped working. i never dropped the phone or anything, just out of the blue it stopped working. i went and bought 4 different charges (about $100 in chargers) to find out none of the chargers worked to turn the phone on. luckily, samsung was very upfront about solving the issue with my phone. since i bought the phone only a month ago, the phone does have a warranty. i haven't received my new phone yet so still to be determined how they handle the warranty. assuming they send another one and everything is smooth then ill be a customer again in the future.overall good phone, just make sure to take care of it assuming it breaks on you. just to make sure they honor the warranty.
i purchased my phone mid 2017 . had fast shipping and product looked to be legit . no issues for the 6-8 months , until the keyboard  started to burn into the screen. this can not be a factory screen as everyone i know with store bought phones have not had this issue. i was very hesitant to order off amazon but figured why not . well this is why not.buy from an authorized dealer!!!
oh yeah! few things i have emotional response to when pleased, but this phone, i love him! the wrap around edge beautiful. hi def screen. options in depth.i'm getting to like bixby too. it's helping open controller i can't find, look up things on the web, dial, message, calculate, set timer, define. still exploring that feature.fingerprint unlocks quickly. the complaints about location next to camera, i guess i got used to it faster than the average monkey! since i use the phone in a holder in the car, i added a 3rd print, for when i reach over the phone in the holder, right index finger upside down.iris recognition, cumbersome.  but when fingers are wet or in gloves, print reader fails. so iris scanner helps.using for music and internet radio at the gym with belt holder and bluetooth earphones. nice custom sound setting for the headset, rich!way way better than my s5.like the feature that if stolen and they reset the phone, it will not work without my unlock info! so don't even try to steal it!
i went from a bootloop ridden lg-g4 to a cheap $50~ phone with a cracked screen/bad mic/speaker for almost 2 years, it didn't really bother me much until i started working and going to college, that's when i started getting lots of calls. so my cheap ass finally decided to get a new phone. after some research, the s8 was the only thing in the 450-500 price range that was was this amazing so i bought it as soon as it was in stock. and i do not regret it for a single moment of the day. this phone has mostly everything i didn't have on my old phone, an amazing screen, water resistant, faster processor, great software, and a good camera. most of the apps samsung has are actually useful or at least decent, too bad my cell company forced me to install a bunch of bad apps. the only con i have for this phone is that it doesn't have a ridiculously long battery life compared to my cheap phone, but the tradeoff is the screen/process power of course. anyways, great phone for the price i guarantee you won't regret it.
the phone i received from this amazon seller is an unlocked verizon phone.  it may or may not have been ""unlocked by samsung"", but that claim is certainly misleading as it leads you to believe that you are receiving a generic universal phone.  verizon is cdma, the other more common carriers are gsm and they are not compatible, though some phones offer some of the frequencies of both types.  when i put my at&t sim card in it, it seemed to work, but the display came up with a verizon welcome page and there was an annoying ""not a verizon sim card"" error message in the notification tray.  you could force the error to go away, but it always came back when you powered up the phone.  i did not trust that i would get true gsm performance out of a verizon phone and might experience slow or degraded performance due to a shortage of available frequencies so i returned the phone and ordered a true unlocked generic phone directly from samsung.  it cost more but the peace of mind is worth it.  for over $700 including tax you shouldn't have to put up with nuisance messages in your new phone, potentially degraded performance or deceptive advertising.1/11/2018 -  received my new phone that i ordered from directly from samsung today.  it is a true generic phone without any carrier software installed and very streamlined.  now that i have seen what a new phone should look like i can also add to my original review that the phone i received from ""electronic deals"" via amazon was not a new phone, or had at least been previously opened because it was missing a few of the accessories were included with the phone i received today and it also had fingerprints all over it. i recommend paying the extra $75 and getting a truly new phone that is universal directly from the samsung store.
why didn't anyone tell me about the samsung galaxy life! i....cuss word....love this phone. love love love! it is so sleek and beautiful  and smooth. the texting ease. the apps. i hardly know what to do with myself, i am overwhelmed by awesomeness. listen to me. if you're like me and keep things in your cart for days and weeks at a time because of indeciveness, please believe me....this will be the one thing that is worth the fast click purchase. i'm so sorry i didn't get it sooner but i will never look back. #samsung fer life!
it is a nice phone and works well. i have been using it for about 4 months and have not had any problems with how fast the phone operates or any software glitches that are game breaking. however, i do not use the bixby button and it is annoying since my old phone's unlock button is now where that button is located. also, when utilizing the phone and accidentally touching the curved edges you get little popups in the corners that are also really annoying. and lastly the curved edges make it extremely hard to protect the phone's screen. this is due to not having a phone case that protects those edges of the phone. i much prefer a flat screen. i did not think this would be a huge deal breaker when i purchased the phone but after dropping it twice, with a case on it, i have received two cracks in the screen. one crack for each drop. i will probably end up replacing the screen and trying to make due with the issue, but i am not happy with samsung over this phone and looking a bit harder in the future at other phone manufacturers.
i bought this phone supposedly new from amazon. when it arrived, everything worked okay except for two major issues:the phone refused to perform software updates over mobile data, despite having proper settingsthe phone microphone does not work at all. phone calls and other tasks which require the microphone render the unit useless unless a headset is connected. amazon support was unhelpful, and samsung support is also useless. this is the second phone i have purchased from them. the first was sent back because the screen stopped responding to touch input. i would not buy a another ""new"" phone from them.
ok, i'm a mediocre tech, so this phone will do a million things i'll never ask of it, i'm sure. i'll leave the reviews of the actual s8 to those who can do it justice. i will keep my comments to the method of purchase, since if you're like me, you worry that the price here is so much less than at att. so, let me just say that the phone arrived in what appeared to be pristinely new packaging. because my previous phone was an s5 i had to go to att for a new sim card (nano vs micro). anyway, they didn't charge me for the sim. i haven't gotten a bill, so i don't know whether i'll have an activation charge, but that would be the case no matter where you purchase. after charging up the phone i started all the opening, transferring, updating. that took an hour or so i think. after that i could text and connect with ease. but, incoming phone calls were so horrible i was just sure i'd screwed up. online research led me to rebooting the phone and that immediately cleared everything up. all of the startup had apparently set something off. so, i'm very pleased with my purchase. i saved over $250 by buying it through the amazon link as opposed to the att plan!!!.
i know i shouldn't be surprised how much nicer the galaxy s8 is than my s4, but good golly!  it's not difficult to make the transition; the way it works is very similar.  but it's got like an intuitive little brain inside it that knows exactly what i want to do next!  i love it.  and they say old dogs can't learn new tricks.  i feel so technologically capable and advanced!
okay. there are lots of negative reviews about this phone but honestly i absolutely love this phone. i used to have an s5 until it got old. i switched to lg for 6 months and i missed my galaxy phone. so i decided to splurge and get myself an s8! that being said... this phone needs a good case. i work around concrete floors so i made certain to buy a solid, shock resistant case with protection around the edges. i also got a glass screen protector just out of paranoia. the phone works incredibly well and performs my level of work i need it to do with no problems. :)
it is as satisfactory as my droid but the screen broke very easily, light impact.  two weeks old.  so bummed as it was my first phone which i purchased outright.  get your screen covers immediately or a case with a cover.bixby button is where you hold the phone.  if you don't use bixby you spend frequent and frustrating moments accidentally turning it on and the of course off.  nuisance.  good photo quality.if you use page plus, there is no wifi calling option provided for on their sim card making good connection unreliable.  odd as it is the same verizon network but what do i know?
the phone was delivered ahead of schedule which is always a plus and was exactly as advertised. had no problem smart switching info from previous s4 and carrier activation (sprint to at&t) was seamless. btw, something not advertised, i did find that the s8 will not allow custom sounds to be tagged to individual contacts when messaging. ring tones sure, but no messaging notifications. so now no matter who messages you, they all sound the same something to keep in mind if that's important to you. i'm told there are work arounds and apps you can download, but..........will modify review later if anything changes.
i ordered this on black friday and after waiting a few weeks it arrived. i didn't expect to actually enjoy an android based phone, but i was pleasantly surprised. my carrier fully supports this phone and i consistently get maximum speeds in my city (150/20). at home i get gigabit wifi. it was a little weird to look at the curved sides, but i got used to it after about 2 days. i highly recommend the otterbox defender case because this phone, like many others, is a bit too thin for large hands.
i bought this phone when it was on sale for $625. great deal, based on other prices. i purchased this after my galaxy s5 died. coming from the s5, this is a major upgrade. the phone is beautiful, but due to my tendency to drop phones, i have it in a case. i expected to be annoyed by bixby (based on other reviews), but i actually like ""her"" so far. she's not siri, but i think she is better than google's personal assistant. i like that you can unlock the phone by telling bixby a voice password and because she learns your voice, she won't respond to another voice. my husband tried to talk to her and she ignored him.besides bixby, there are a number of upgrades from the s5. rather than several pages with apps (you can still do that), there is an edge ""tray"" that you can use to easily access your favorite apps. i strongly recommend watching a youtube video to get to know the phone because it can do a lot. without it, i wouldn't have known about the edge tray, because it is well hidden. i've only had the phone for less than 24 hours, but i will update the review if my opinion changes.
i just got my phone yesterday, it arrived in two days.  i thing it should have been backed a little as only was shipped from an amazon warehouse.  the phone came in a box with very little padding.  i have to say i love my new phone, at it was new not refurbished.  i also had no problems registering it on the samsung website.  i was a little skeptical in purchasing this at first, there are many negative reviews when it comes to buying a cell phone.  i am glad i bought and i am sure you will too.
i love the phone but i think i got one with a defect, it randomly freezes and turns off
4.5/5 for this phone. i am an iphone user making the switch to android. so far i really like the phone. very easy to use. definitely love the storage on this phone. screen is very pleasing to the eyes. only critque is the finger scanner. too small and awkwardly placed in my opinion.
if you want a gorgeous device with a great camera and amazing specs look no further. when i got the s8 i was a little worried about it being used. to my surprise it was absolutely perfect. i had a couple concerns and after emailing the seller and they went above and beyond to help. i'm completely satisfied with my purchase.
the phone came in it's original box. at first glance it looked like everything was in order but upon further inspection the booklet was nowhere to be found. the headphones included weren't the usual samsung brand ones but akg ones. i found the sound quality of said ear pieces to be subpar to the samsung ones, not to mention that one of the covers that held the logo of the brand akg came loose after 3 days of use. next on the list are the charger and the usb-c cable, we own another s8 so we compared the usb-c ends of both. the cable that came with the new device had a slightly longer end that didn't fit either device properly, not to mention that the inside was a different colour and looked sligthiy damaged. no matter what cable was being used or what device was being charged the charger would emit a loud and annoying buzzing until whatever was being charged had full batteries.the phone is performing well although it's important to note that upon first startup the phone didn't go through it's first setup process but instead went straight to the home screen. all other accessories were present in the box. tried contacting the seller regarding the issues i found to no avail. the phone is excellent, however i would not recommend the seller.
let me begin by saying that due to the poor reviews and questions regarding whether the phone has a manufacturer warranty or comments that the phone was not new, received without included accessories, or stopped working shortly after being purchased, i went direct to samsung to purchase an s8 as my s6 suddenly stopped working.i had no problem paying a slight premium to know that i'd be getting a warranty and a new phone, however after placing my order on samsung.com, i was informed the s8 was backordered for two weeks. since i was without a phone and at&t wanted over $900 to purchase up front, i didn't have much of a choice and decided to try purchasing this one from amazon.i placed my order on friday, purchased the supplemental warranty from squaretrade, and my phone was delivered just as i got home that evening. even with the squaretrade warranty, the total price was still less than what samsung wanted just for the s8.the phone was in the original samsung packaging and contained all of the standard accessories including the wall charger, cord, adapters for a usb to micro usb and micro usb to usb-c, headphones, pamphlets, and the protective plastic on the phone. it was clearly brand new.i logged into my samsung account after setting the phone up and entered the imei number. the phone came right up and stated a valid samsung warranty. i confirmed this with samsung customer service as well. the warranty is for 12 months and covers everything aside from water and physical damage, so the squaretrade warranty should cover the physical damage portion.as for the phone itself the picture and sound quality is fantastic, the camera is great, and it is overall super user friendly. battery life is ok as it will run a full day with heavy use, but my s6 was nearly dead by early afternoon so i can’t complain.overall i’m very happy with this purchase. received the phone hours after ordering and it was in perfect condition with everything i expected. i have at&t and i just inserted my sim card and was good to go. i understand the negative reviewers may have had bad experiences so i cannot comment on the consistency of the phones but mine was great all around.
learning experiencei’ve been out of the phone market for a long time. our samsung s3 & s4 were excellent for many years. they started crashing, so it was time to buy new. i did not want to spend a grand on new phones, so started with motorola g6 from costco, on sale for $189. before i get into the details, while speaking with my carrier tech support, i was directed to amazon and the s8 on sale for $449.00. that is a grand for two phones. i sat down with the motorola and samsung side by side.my old phones had visual voice mail (no data required) and i could send photos via text through wi-fi to save on data. neither the motorola or samsung will do that, and after speaking with a bunch of folks apparently no new phones will do that without third party apps. data must be turned on to use visual voice mail or send photos. what a rip-off. you would thing since the consumer spends a significant amount of money on samsung products or whatever brand you prefer, they would be vastly superior to the old phones-not so. buy a carrier-based phone and they have an app for visual voice mail, but not so for unlocked phones. using the phones side by side for a few days, i did not see the value of over double the price of the samsung vs. the g6, so the new s8’s go back to amazon. i’ve always been a samsung fan, but am disappointed that the industry has gone this route. wish my old s4 still worked, i’d keep it.
relative to what i would have paid if i'd gone full price, i'm happy with the phone overall.i did a side by side comparison of the used device and the brand new device i ordered on my own and with enmployees at the att store and none of us could find any imperfections so a+ in that regard.however, after less than two months the speaker is terrible. it sounds like i'm playing whatever i'm listening to (mostly music and podcasts) from the inside of a box. i thought the muffled noise issue might have something to do with water exposure after being near the shower (i know, i know, water resistant does not mean waterproof), so i took some precautionary measures as soon as i noticed the distortion, turned it off, and tossed it in a bag with silica gel overnight. for a phone that's advertised as being resistant to spills, it's kind of a joke that sitting on a shelf outside a shower could spell disaster for its audio output.additionally, the phone is a lot less durable than one would expect. i still expected the glass screen to be more resistant to scratches.
i wanted to write a review about the product because other reviews helped me when deciding on whether or not to get this phone. alli can say is get this phone. the phone itself is beautiful. it's sleek and fits nicely in your hand. the processor is fast, it's very responsive, and all around a great phone for this price. i've always been an android user and this phone doesn't disappoint. most of these reviews are about bixby and how annoying she is, how the battery isn't as good as other samsung phones, and the list can go on and on. regardless of those things, i think it's still an all around great phone, because nothing is perfect. for this price, i would recommend getting this phone! just remember to keep it protected no matter what! hope this review helped other skeptical buyers! :)
i had this phone for about 2 weeks, but i ended up returning it. the camera was really great and took quality photos. i also like the overall design and feel the phone felt very premium. but ultimately i didn't enjoy the samsung skin over android, and the software felt jittery compared to my previous phone which was the oneplus 3. additionally the placement of the fingerprint sensor was very annoying to me as a left handed person who holds their phone and their left hand of majority of the time. it was just too hard to reach and inconvenient to use.
***update 12/7/18- 9 months later and it's still awesome. no problem! i highly recommend  this phone and the seller also.buy it. you will not regret it.02/22/18i am happy i ordered this phone. it came on time and the condition is just excellent. the charger, an earpiece with extra ear buds, an eject pin for the sim card slot came in the box. there was no form of scratch on the phone. it looked pretty new!!! i have been using it for a few days now and it works well. also, i must say i got my metro pcs sim to work in it and it was like a 123 set up. the signal is good. overall, it's a great phone eventhough it maybe be too early to tell. i will give an update in a few months time.
the samsung galaxy s8+ is very powerful, very large screen with excellent picture quality.  from a usability standpoint, there simply isn't many better phones out there.  but the curved screen, while unique, leaves a bit to be desired.  when gripping the phone, it's easy to touch things on the sides.  and when apps are not optimized for the curve, some ""buttons"" may be on the curve and difficult to click on (good example is a x for closing an ad.  might be right on the curve of the glass).  also, it's difficult to find a good case and that case may not be able to fully protect the phone.  this is because the case cannot fully cover the sides of the phone due to the curved glass.my next phone will not have curved glass.
the title of this phone states that it is an unlocked phone by samsung and works on all networks and is a ""u.s."" version.  these are all lies.  the imei number was blacklisted and even after calling samsung they informed us it was not a ""u.s."" version but rather an international version which would not work....a complete waste of time and ruined what was going to be a christmas present for a family member.
great, great phone.  if i could change one thing it would be the glass backing.  i removed my case because it degrades the quality of photos greatly.  i walked into a cement pylon while walking around sightseeing and it ended up cracking the back glass just below all the important stuff.  thankfully it all still works but i wasn't running, just walking, and the compression between my leg and the pylon was enough.  about the only issue i have had with it that is samsung's ""fault"".
hardware is top notch. the phone is impressively powerful and the beautiful screen makes using it a joy. music fans will love the sd card support and 3.5mm jack. (yes, it's still able to store your old massive collection of mp3s and you can enjoy it with your expensive wired headphones!)battery lasts the day (unless you're in a cell deadspot) and will get you through the night if you do a rapid top up around noon.the unit is mostly waterproof and will survive in the rain or shower (both tested) but it won't be much use under water and probably won't survive anything much deeper than a bathtub.software might not be to everyone's liking but it's the usual android system underneath so you can change it however you like.only real downside is that it's so pleasant to use i don't use my expensive pc much anymore.
i bought the phone on november 2017.1. two weeks of use and i started noticing a green line appears on the screen. when i searched, found that it is a common issue. i raised a request with amazon and got the phone replaced.2. i always use a phone cover. close to one year of usage, i removed the phone cover to clean the phone. noticed that the phone back cover has cracks. i have never dropped the phone. not sure how the cracks came. again when i searched about it, looks like many people have the same issue.3. now after 1 year and 2 months of use, the phone has completely stopped working. keeps restarting and displays ""ram dump by hard reset"". i can't get into boot mode or download mode to reset the phone. when i took to the samsung customer care, they said it is out of warranty now and cannot be fixed. it seems that is a motherboard issue and they can't fix it.total waste of 600$..
phone is nice but doesnt support wifi calling which is an extremly important feature for me. i assumed it would since it was backed by samsung and such a newer phone but it does not. i didnt realize this until i argued with my carrier about poor service for a few months and discovered it waa the phone not being able to use wifi calling in the areas i had less coverage, by that time i was told it was to late for any refunds or exchanges and they made the suggestion i try to sell the phone to someone who doesnt need wifi calling...
phone works great on verizon even though the box etc had the at&t logo all over it.  strange thing was that i ordered an s8 a couple months ago from the same amazon web link and got a verizon phone which is what i wanted.  so my wife liked my phone and i simply used the link from my previous amazon order and low and behold i get this at&t one.  took this new s8 to the verizon store and they did their magic and loaded all my wifes contacts/apps/etc from her old phone to this at&t one and everything works fine.  strange thing is that both phones were ordered from the same amazon link but were fulfilled by different suppliers.  the verizon phone came from jts wireless and the at&t phone came from levy commerce.  i should also say that both phones were definitely new phones, not rebuilt, even though the amazon website did not explicitly say new.  i did post a question and was answered that i was purchasing a new phone.
i'm typing the review on the phone right now so it would be rather difficult to take a picture of the product, but that being said. i'm very happy with the phone and only have minor complaints about it.the good:great and quality displaythe speakers are better than most phones from this particular generationi'm yet to have the phone crash or have any major problemsgreat initial battery life (will come back to this)camera quality is astounding even on lower settingsthe bad:the bixby button is a satan spawn and never should have been made into an actual button. ""okay google"" is far superior in basically every way.the battery life i've found has steadily declined in only a few months. it used to i could go almost a full day and a hald without charging. i purchased the phone i think in june and it's now december 31st, 2018 at the time of my review, and i have to charge 2-3 times a day usually with the same amount of use.also did i mention the bixby button?conclusion:all in all a great phone with a great interface and very user friendly as well as good durability with very few complaints about it
i was getting sick and tired of my one day battery life on my old phone.  the samsung s8+ is rated higher than the s9+ for battery life so i went for it.  it was several hundred dollars less than what verizon wanted.  i charge it every other day now.  the bad:  well, not that bad.  my verizon caller id no longer worked because this is an unlocked version (kind of generic so to speak) also my verizon voicemail (visual voicemail) was not available.  big deal,i found another.  no issues.  i am using the free app hiya for caller id and block.  awesome.
the phone itself works fine with great colors and reasonably fast. take excellent pictures and videos and all in all would buy it again. my biggest negative is that for some reason within two weeks of having this phone it crashed and unfortunately i had just taken about 60 pictures that day which never made it to the cloud and i lost them all. very disappointing.
this is a very fast and attractive phone. it is narrow enough to hold comfortably in your hand but still has a large screen. the camera takes sharp pictures and is quickly accessed from your lock screen. i like the edge menu and customized it to give me quicker access to apps i use most. audio in all forms gets great playback quality. the speakerphone is loud and clear for video or voicemail playback and there is customization in the sound menu to tailor headphone audio to your hearing spectrum. battery life is good, generally lasting anywhere from a day to a day and a half, and power saving mode is easily enabled if you're low. i effortlessly enrolled it in samsung premium care, but i purchased directly from amazon, a samsung authorized retailer. the phone is not perfect. i don't find bixby useful and am disappointed about the inability to reassign its dedicated button. the phone has a quality feel, but the all glass exterior made me wary to use it unprotected and i wrapped it in a case and screen protector immediately. the curvature on the screen edges also makes it difficult to find and install suitable screen protection. overall, this phone does everything i want, it’s unlocked so i don't have to root to cut carrier bloat (although there is some samsung bloatware) and none of my complaints outweigh the things it does well.
i was sold a galaxy s8+ that was for at&t and not unlocked. i was on chat with verizon tech support for over three hours trying to add my current account to the phone and we found out it isn't unlocked. so, i had to purchase a code in order to unlock it and i won't get the code for two-four days. very unhappy. shouldn't advertise that a phone is unlocked if it actually isn't. the phone is compatible with verizon but it is just the fact i have to go through this after spending about $450. other than that the phone is nice and does work great.
i will simply add to the ""i love it"" category but i do want to add something that might not be known. samsung is a bit deceptive in their advertising of this phone. the infinity display is not really infinity. notice they overexpose the edges on the image shown for this product. this is to hide the fact that the display does not really go from edge to edge. it goes over the curve slightly but there is a noticeable edge around the display. it is not technically an infinity display. that's a bit of a letdown, but not a game changer for me in saying i still love the phone. mostly because the camera is great and the battery is sick, that is awesome.
had this phone for a couple months now and i thoroughly enjoy all the features especially the camera. the quality of the camera (which is important to me because i take a lot of pictures) is great and i like the sleek design. be careful of the always on display. it can burn your screen.
that was a great price. took the nano sim straight from our one plus 2, inserted and booted up and worked 100% (tmobil). painless switchover! battery is better than my s6, not twice the life of when the sy was new, but significantly longer between charges. my s6’s camera is still hard to beat, but for processing, graphics speed and display, and the extensible storage make this a clear winner!
after reading the reviews, i was a little skeptical about purchasing this  phone, from this seller.  but i had no problem with having verizon activate this phone. i am on a prepaid plan with verizon kamma and all they did was walk in to the verizon store ,and he put the sim card in, he got on the phone ,asked me a few questions and it was activated.  when i told him what i read online , about some verizon reps saying the phone wasn't compatible, he agreed that there may have been a ploy to get them to return that phone, and buy it through the verizon store.  considering i live in the northeast, and we have had several snowstorms ,  the seller kept me updated as to when my prime amazon delivery would get to me. it was due to be delivered on a thursday, but was ultimately delivered on saturday. absolutely great experience all the way around
i was supposed to receive the sm-g955uzkaxaa , but received a sm-g955fzkdxsg instead. what i received is not compatible with verizon.  this is a phone for the middle east, not the us.  attached is a picture with the phone info showing it is a united arab emirates phone.
very happy to find the samsung s8 unlocked version on an amazon warehouse deal. i saved tons of money, and the phone came brand new in the box with plastic protectors still on and everything intact. one caution about buying an unlocked phone is some features that your carrier offers may not work. for instance, i have at&t, and i don't have visual voicemail on this phone. you should research online before you buy an unlocked phone for your particular carrier and see what may not work on the unlocked version. but other than the minor nuisance, i love the freedom of being able to take the phone to whatever network i may want to use.  in terms of the phone itself, i personally don't like the curved screen aspect at all. but it works very similarly to my samsung s6 (rip),  and you pretty much have to keep upgrading (unfortunately) to keep a fast, functional, supported phone.
first and foremost, the samsung galaxy s8 has been one of my favorite android smartphones of all time. the camera quality, for amateur photographers like myself, is pretty darn good. furthermore, the processor is super fast and responsive, which compared to the galaxy s5 that i had, is a huge upgrade. also, the battery life is amazing. for me, with excessive use of listening to music, scrolling through social media, and other nonsense stuff, the charge lasted from 5-6am to around 10pm or 11pm. overall, i was very impressed with the phone.some things that i personally did not like: - the side button that kept triggering the assistant was super annoying. even after disabling the assistant, hitting the button would still bring up the interface for it - audio quality wasn't the greatest; however, what phone has perfect audio - the screen size was also larger than the standard screen size at the time. so videos and images taken with other devices didn't fit perfectly on the screen, which was slightly annoyingoverall, i was satisfied with my purchase of a certified refurbished phone from warehouse deals, inc until my phone wouldn't turn on one day while i was studying abroad in costa rica. i tried both hard resetting and soft resetting the phone to try to get it turned on, but nothing worked. eventually, once i returned to the us, i sent the phone into samsung, mistakenly thinking my phone was still under warranty, and it turns out that whoever declared the product that i received as ""certified refurbished"" was clearly mistaken as there was a huge problem with the circuit board with my phone that was more than likely caused by this ""refurbishing"" process or by the previous customer who had sold the phone to warehouse deals, inc. furthermore, since amazon does not supply the imei number on the receipt, samsung could not fulfill the request to fix the phone per the warranty, and i would have had to pay over $600 to repair it. moral of the story, i recommend buying a warranty, either through samsung or amazon, with the purchase of a certified refurbished phone to avoid the hassle that i went through, unless you want to waste $500 on a phone that only lasts 3 months due to a hardware malfunction.
im not going to get into huge detail here, but i love this phone.the camera is amazingthe screen is amazingthe fingerprint scanner works better than everyone says it does.i have taken this phone in the shower with me multiple times. 0 problems.it played music underwater (not recommended) with 0 problems.it does take a little getting used to, but the longer i have it, the more i love it.honestly i can't think of one thing i don't like.except that i wish the bixby button was programmable.and i would recommend the otterbox defender series case. ive had it for weeks and it has been incredible.
had a blackberry priv with android that cost me gazzilion and died on me in about a year.as soon as i turned this phone on, immediately noticed incredible difference as to the speed: opening apps, installing, uninstalling, opening and browsing the internet - bam! everything happens just about immediately with this phone, no delays, no ""thinking"" no crashing (so far).one thing that annoys me a bit is really how sophisticated the phone is, like if you put it on a table screen down it will do certain things, face up others, tons of options for how the screen will behave what light what notifications even the movement of the phone itself makes it behave differently, basically i'd have to spend many hours figuring it out that's the only thing but i guess there are bigger problems out there..
samsung is on a roll right now when it comes to making flagship devices. the s8 bundles in good looks, an amazing screen and some great software features.i was a bit hesistant buying a samsung phone due to their infamous software lag and heavy skins on top of android. but this ui is much better than previous samsung releases.the only cons are the late software updates and possiblity of the phone slowing down in a couple of months. but for now everything works great.
i love it.  it works like a charm.  i just wish they kept the led notice lights where i could program the different apps and callers with as with the older versions.  you should download the google keyboard, i kept hitting the period button instead of the space bar with the key board that it came with.
 do not buy this. i bought this for my mom , but instead i got an empty box with fake jewerly in it. the seller name is samsung ,but it is not. ""dont be foul""
loving my s8+. upgraded from moto g5 plus. loving the big edge to edge display. battery life is amazing. 15% battery on old phone estimated about 1 1/2 hours left. on the s8+, when i got 15% battery reminder i checked in settings and it estimated about 3 1/2 hours worth of battery left. thought the s8+ might be too big, but now it feels like the perfect size and i'm glad i went for the bigger screen. fast charging is awesome. bought myself a wireless charger for the nightstand and i'm loving that feature, as well. pictures are great. phone arrived earlier than expected. great seller. a+
phone works great however, i realized i cannot do the video calling to another verizon customer as i did with my samsung 7 phone.  it's a verizon feature that these unlocked phones do not have or come with.  i actually loved the fact that you can be on a regular phone call then switch over to a video call.  will have to use the whatsapp video call instead.
phone is cool, can definitly do a lot with it. for once i actually found some of the pre-installed apps to be usefull. disapointed in the battery life, not nearly as good as all the hype.
the best phone ever! !the specs of this phone don't speak out much, but this phone is filled with tons of features, just name the feature. it is thin, perfect looking, brilliant camera. looks great in our hands. battery my old phone used to consume around 80% of the battery life during the day but this phone has only consumed 35%. amazing perforce. the new bixby feature is a great move by samsung. google assistant makes the phone even better. the new screen off feature is too good. the edge feature is very usefull at times. has fingerprint scanner face scanner and iris scanner. the iris scanner, my favorite,  is super fast much better than the iphone x. the finger print sensor is awkward in position but its super fast too. the screen is mind blowing. dont hesitate to buy this... worst every penny
what a great phone.  so happy that i left apple.  everything is great: camera, wireless charging, face or fingerprint sign-in, the built in speakers, the gorgeous screen, the headphone jack (!!!!)... a very smartly made phone, very reliable and quite a tool when you're out in the world - a powerful computer in your pocket.  even the free earbuds it came with are pretty good.  it's a new world being a non-apple customer.once i got a wireless charger for home and a wireless charger for the office, i appreciated this phone even more!
yes!!! it works on verizon wireless. i took out the sim chip out of my working s6 and plugged it into the s8 and it just worked!!! nothing else needed, no activation needed.this is an early review.. ill append as i fiddle around with the phone.con:  no ir blaster (so no controlling infrared devices like a tv or cable box unless theyre ""smart"" devices on the same network) so you cant use it as a universal remote control like i did with the s5 and s6
i got this despite their description stating that it is not compatible with sprint because people state that it did.  after some time at the sprint store to get my sim card i managed to get it working with no problems.  just have to go to what they refer to as ""corporate"" sprint stores to get the sim card and make a call and follow through.
i wa using the device until battery goes to 0% and turned off. i tried to charge it, but phone no powered up neither by wire charger or wirless charger.after return the phone for warranty, samsung found a pba damage. but  due to some scratches in lcd screen, they denied doing the repair under warranty, and demanded a repair fee of u$637.obviously, is cheaper buy a new one. but it is a better business for me to buy an iphone.
bought this phone for my wife. we have verizon as our carrier so we were just a tad nervous if it would work or not. received the item with no scratches or ding marks. screen was perfect. put in her sim card from her s7 edge and the phone immediately picked up verizon. no issues. all of the apps on her old phone transferred perfectly to the new phone. battery seems to be in great shape. it holds a charge very well. so far no issues what so ever. keeping fingers crossed that it stays this way. we are prime members so we knew we would be ok for the first couple of weeks if we had any problems with the product, but so far, all is good! very happy.
almost like my nexus 6p better.. this phone does have wifi calling, something i use since i have poor mobile coverage where i live. it charges fast and does the trick... just wish samsung would perfect the wifi to data crossovers better.  seems like it gets hung up (no pun intended) on the change overs.... i have to airplane mode it more times than not
my high school son received this phone just over a year ago, and has had no problems with it and is still using it. so this is the second one we have purchased for our house. my complaint, when this one arrived was the fact that this multiple hundred dollar item was in a box 3 times it size with absolutely no packing at all. it was just free floating from one end of the box to the other when i pick it up. just the lack of respect for my money to not take the time to humor me with some packing ticked me off
gorgeous phone. all glass. fingerprint sensor location is not so bad as reviews indicate.disabling app power manager/optimize battery is a must for receiving notifications in timely manner. if you need just led notifications but no sound, you need to download and use silent.mp3 tone.bixby button not so scary since it can be remapped.looks frigile i would never use a case, so really hope i don't drop it.very nice deal at $460, thanks amazon!
this phone has been amazing so far, no issues and the battery last for quite awhile, anywhere from 8 to 12 hours or possibly more based on how often i decide to play games and text on my phone. the camera quality is beautiful and crisp and the option to filter out blue light is defently a plus since i stay on my phone before i go to sleep. i loved my lg g5 but this is my new baby.
better then phones from tracfone the unlocked feature lets you use features locked on tracfones such as fm radio for free no data needed. you can update software versions on android and such it allows you to use it on any type of service  you have slot for sim card and for memory card it as all the samsung galaxy features you could ask for
such a great phone! after doing months of research, i wasn't sure which phone to choose. pixel 2, lg v30, s8 or even iphone.  i finally decided the s8 has most everything i wanted.  wireless charging, great camera, decent battery and a perfect screen!after a month, i am so happy with my decision!  wonderful phone, perfect!
was a decent phone until the burn in started to become noticable 6 months in. now closer to a year the screen burn in is unbearable. planned obsolescence at its finest.good antenna good battery. bixby doesn't seem any more useful than google assitant.
just got this phone today after waiting days in need of a phone. my excitement was replaced by anger when after an hour long conversation with support i am told that i can either send it to samsung or return for a refund. the refurbished phones are locked & you cannot access them. amazon knows this & they continue to sell them anyway. amazon has crossed me for the last time!
after reading some of the questions and answers i contacted my local verizon affiliate and told them that i wanted to activate this phone.  i've been a good customer there over the years and they were eager to help me.  basically we activated a new micro sim card in a used phone they had using my existing number.  we then transferred the sim card into this phone and basically the deal was done.  i still had to log into my google account and use the samsung transfer setup to move info but it all went smooth.  really enjoying this phone!  what a camera!
it was a huge upgrade from the galaxy note 4the screen is very clear and large.i'm still getting used to the weird way it screenshots but that's a software thing... and well it is mostly okay.it's a fast working machine, the camera quality is amazing. i love taking underwater movies. it does not do underwater pictures well. it's like it doesn't register my fingers touching the screen when there's water all over it. but video is fine.battery life is fine. i'm on my phone a good amount, not watching movies but listening to music and social media and the battery will last me a day a night and a bit more.
i was very happy that i upgraded to the s8 and was loving it all week until i realized it wouldn't let me connect to any wifi at all besides the one at my home. my college has free wifi and it worked perfectly fine on my s7edge, but on my s8, it said wifi is blocked. i tried wifi in mcdonalds, parks, restaurants, and the wifi are all blocked. what on earth? it said i should contact my phone provider or what not and i am kind of really upset.
been an iphone user since the 4, up until this baby came into my life. initially i was scared to take the leap but i'm glad i did. the s8 is the most beautiful phone i've come across and i'm so happy that it's mine. it does everything i need and more. if you're thinking about switching to android, this is the sign for you to take that leap.fast shipping & perfect condition! all i had to do to activate mine (w verizon) was transfer my sim card from my 6+ to the s8 and voila! i'm a very happy girl with my new s8 :)
came packaged in different box,but was in fantastic condition!! looked brand new! (even if it was just a recently released phone and used) it definitely gets a thumbs up from me! and my wife is definitely loving her “new “ phone!!!
exactly as described.  samsung makes high quality products and the true rival to iphones, if you are not an apple fan.-pros:unlocked as described, just insert sim card and i'm in business.sleek designbattery life is good (expected since is a new phone, let's see after a few months)updates to android 8.0 oreo without rooting it.-cons (for me)comes with facebook pre-installed, can be disable if you are not a facebook user, but can't be remove.bixby app (samsung assistant version of alexa, ""ok, google""), not interested in another assistant
went to connect the phone to metropcs and was told that the phone was reported stolen and they won’t connect it.
phone was defective, would not send photos in texts.  after a lengthy investigation, samsung tech support identified the hardware as defective, and authorized a return.
pleased. be sure of passwords. i got in a mess. very slippery. get a good case.
i bought this phone for my husband as a christmas present.  he found it very easy to transition from his old s4 to this one (and he hates change!!).
of course since my old samsung was an s5, it took a bit of learning. the phone it's self works great. while i hesitated because it was a refurb, it works as promised. very pleased with it. just wish i could have plugged it into my head and understood all it did. :)
dope phone. i'm writing this review from it. i've had it for many months now without problems. i'm on at&t. they activated it right in the store for free, took less than 5 minutes. picture quality is phenomenal and the phone in general is just gorgeous to look at. i don't use a case or screen protector, just a pop socket, but i also don't drop my phone. i've heard the glass is fragile, so you should consider getting a case.
so, like many of yall i was a little skeptical about buying a phone online. i've never done it before, however.. i have had it since monday and it came in perfect condition, there was no scratches, no dings and the software runs perfectly. i just slipped my at&t sim card into it and here we are. lol, honestly, everything about this phone is so good, the camera quality is great, the battery lasts me all day and i constantly scroll through apps. the screen is big and bright so you can see everything you are reading and i love how thin and easy to hold the phone is. i 100% recommend this phone to anyone!!
i don't usually leave reviews but this phone is stunning. i bought the phone through a third party seller that offered the phone with a bundle of high quality accessories. all for $40 dollars less than the listed amazon price. i couldn't be happier with my purchase.a warning though like many other reviewers this phone is very delicate put a good case and screen protector on this phone it definitely is not meant to be naked. the water proof design is a life savior as my previous phones had died to h2o, it's nice to know this phone is safe against most situations.
overall, i am very satisfied with the phone. the camera is quite good but it doesn't handle low-light as well as i had hoped. the screen is definitely scratch resistant (you can scratch at the screen with your keys and it won't leave a mark). the glass (front and back) are not impact resistant and you can expect them to crack the first time the phone falls from your hands and hits a hard floor (i was aware of this issue beforehand, so no complaints here).
paid 489.99, knowing it had cosmetic damage and used. came with clear case and charger. had phone for 2 days. technology speaking: so far so good. only two minor obvious scratches and 1 barely noticable (mind you it was to be expected) but both were on the back screen which appears to be easily replaced and i'm the type of person to take the time out to do that.the other is easily covered with a case...no front screen damage, came two days early; seems like a steal for an avg  $800/unlocked phone.
i purchased my galaxy s8 and everything was great and running perfectly. after about a month or two of me having service under metro pcs (yes i know they arent the best) my phone randomly started saying that i couldnt receive service anymore. after taking it yo metro pcs, i was told they cannot really help me because it was not purchased from. the phone still works fine and this review was written from the actual phone but i cannot have service turned on because of (as it was explained to me) a problem with unlocked phones being kind of a roll of the dice especially when purchasing it online. i didnt want to go through fighting with the company to work a deal with samsung on my warranty because i didnt have time working 14 hours a day and seeing reviews saying that they dont help you anyway.overall the phone is awesome and works fine. that has been my only issue and ive had the phone for nearly a year in 3 months. i guess you get what you paid for, saving a couple hundred but cannot get service. it works on wifi but cant call or text from it but i have to much on here to get rid of it or something.
i upgraded from the s5 to the s8 what a major difference i activated it on the verizon network and since i already had a verizon phone it was as easy as installing my verison sim card in the s8 and turning it on. i would highly recommend this phone
second smart phone i got on amazon. got another great deal! the only issue is with verizon for what ever reason when i have a voice message it does not notify me or have an indicator because i did not get it from verizon. that is what the verizon tech told me. otherwise i am very happy with this purchase.
the phone itself is great, but not the primary reason for this review. amazon customer service is. concerns were raised upon delivery when the seal on the box was compromised, but both items were still inside. upon further inspection, i noticed there was no factory seal on the phone box itself, which essentially voids the ""new"" description of the phone. i immediately called customer service to voice my concerns and have them noted on the order. they understood and promptly began working on a solution. the adequate compensation was nice, but not my priority. having the notes on the order in the event that i discover problems with the device was. i was told that if something should surface, the problem will be addressed, resolved, or replaced. i found comfort in that. so overall, amazon customer service was great in this case. the device itself has exceeded my expectations so far, and would recommend it. in fact, i'll be looking into purchasing another for my other half.
this phone is just amazing. with the included app and usb cable adapters it was super easy to transfer all my files, including text messages from my old motorola droid to this samsung s8. for those that are wondering, i was able to easily set up this new phone up with verizon. did not even need to call in. anyone who says this phone does not work with verizon is wrong. i can't say enough good things about this phone. if you are thinking about it, just buy one. you will love it! wish the speaker where a little louder, but otherwise this phone is perfect.
i bought this phone used. i was skeptical. i went on seller options and found one that was in good condition. i got a description of the exact phone. the seller indicated that the phone had a few scratches on the back but the  overall condition was good. when i got the phone it appeared brand new, no scratches. it functions excellently.  i've been using it since november and feel like i bought it brand new.
i am extremely satisfied with this phone. had no issues activating it with my current verizon account. just went to the retailer for a free sim card and they set everything up. one thing that i wished i had known prior to purchasing this was that with an unlocked phone you will  not have voicemail notifications. this is software that is installed by carriers onto the carrier specific phones. the only way you will know if you have voicemail is to call your mailbox. there are some apps available to download so this really isn't an issue. i just wish i had known about this so i wouldnt have missed some messages.
i am sure i would have liked this phone as i had done plenty of research before purchasing. the phone itself is fine however upon boot it appeared to be defaulted to spanish. not a good sign. the phone is touted to be an unlocked us version of the phone, however, this does not appear to be the case for the one i got. after changing the language for the phone and pulling the version number (sm-g950f), i determined this one to be a european version. there is no cdma radio capability and verizon fails to provision this phone on their network. a bit disappointed and returning.
i have verizon and they said that this wasn't an unlocked phone. i am returning this.
works well with armor case.  i applied with case on to get an exact fit.  bubbles disappeared within 2 days to leave a completely transparent voating..  so far protector has stayed on without issue for nine days.  i like the texture and touch sensitivity is gone.
the phone worked fine for about a month, but then got stuck in a boot loop. it stopped working completely less than a week out of the return window. samsung support has done nothing and say to call a number that never picks up after 3+ hours. i am in no way happy, this is god awful service on a broken product.
if you are hesitant about buying this phone, simple .. dont be. i love it. i really don't need to be writing 4 paragraphs to explain how great it is, you'll see as soon as you try it out. but yah anyways, i strongly recommend.don't listen to negative reviews.
s8 has a consistent and better, more intuitive user interface than prior models.  very good compatibility with common apps and applications.  but for real, does the world really need another new device with a non standard plug?  yes, i am going to ding you -3 stars for that silliness.
i got this phone january 2018. it worked really well for a year. then the battery drained to 0% while on the charger and would not charge. wireless or a plug charging would not do a thing. replaced the battery through a repair company only to have it happen again. recommend just going through your service provider so you have some insurance.
i paid money for new one, but from this packaging, i don't feel this is the new one. the phone's protection membrane is intact, but i still highly doubt that this is a return product from other!
fast efficient and takes awesome pictures.only drawback is that the fingerprint sensor is beside the camera which might take some time getting used to and looks odd.awesome infinity displayvery thin and practically no bezelsdisplay : 9/10audio : 8/10speed : 8/10camera : 9/10
google removed ""message tone"" from its contacts app in the o/s that ships w/ this phone. this is a deal breaker! each and every text message now has the same damn notification sound. the only work around is supposed to be to download an updated version of the samsung messages app to set custom notifications per conversation thread. of course, going into the app to select update shows it has the latest version of the app which doesn't include  this half-baked work around.suggestions to switch to a 3rd party app that supports per contact notifications is  unacceptable. it's ridiculous to propose an option that will cause me to lose my 10,000+ text message history.
still beautiful and nice compared to the latest smart phones like galaxy s9 s9+ or note seriescompact, handy, and productive.if you say this phone is not good, you yet don't know how to use it.
registered with samsung, got the warranty, everything works amazingly!
much better phone than anything apple i have ever owned! it was either this or an lg!
i bought this phone for my son he really likes it we have been a samsung family for years only way i would switch is if they quit making them.  i don't know all the particulars on the s 8 but my son hasn't complained anything about it so that's a good sign
it came in very good conidition and works just like new! worked perfectly with at&t and it has flawless performance. if you just want an s8+ and don't care about a scratch on the glass back or a nick here and there, then you will absolutely love this. nothing a case or skin can't fix anyways. make sure to get this from 97% positive and up sellers though, don't take risks when buying products like these.
this phone is the best! love how it looks, how it works, and it's not heavy or big at all.
apparently samsung changed the menus, on the open network unlocked phones like this one, and eliminated wireless calling and video calling from the menus.  this is a problem that many people are having with this phone but samsung refuses to provide a patch to fix the problem. reviews talk about the phone being capable of wireless calling but for some reason samsung changed the menu for this open network phone.  you have to download third party apps like freetone and skype to use these features.  other than that the phone works well.
i've only had the phone for 2 full days so i'm still learning.  but it is user friendly.  i like the size and the different sounds.  on my blu phone though i could get text messages without having the data turned on.  that would be the biggest thing that i do not like so far.
unlocked phone that works as expected.  i purchased to use with prepaid service and was very difficult to activate.  they kept saying the phone was not unlocked.  after about 2 hours was able to resolve.
took it to a verizon store and everything went smooth. the verizon employee asked me where i purchased the phone. when i told him i bought it off amazon he said nice phone and that it was unlocked. a lot cheaper than buying from verizon. pleased with purchase so far.
i bought this unlocked galaxy s8 directly from amazon - not a 3rd party seller.  brand new, all accessories in box as advertised.  brought it to verizon and once we got a sim card in it everything worked as it should.  i don’t have any verizon bloatware on the phone (unlocked) which is a bonus.  huge upgrade from my old htc desire 816  in almost every aspect (though i have to admit the htc had better stereo speakers).  amazon price was $180 less than verizon for the same phone.
great cellphone!  it is well made and very easy to work with.  if you can, get the s8 note.  i had one before this and i miss the note.  nothing beats the note in any category.  i may take a $ loss and go back to/switch to the s8 note.
there are many issues with this phone.1) battery drains extremely fast , even when not using it2) cant download mms even after restoring apn and other fixes3) lost calls where phone doesn't ring and caller goes straight to voicemaili have had other samsung phones in past, but none this bad.would not recommend.
bought 6 months ago, and it's everything i wanted in a phone and more! i avoided setting up bixby, just cuz i don't use virtual assistants much. the space is so awesome!!! it's also really sturdy - i've dropped it on concrete with nothing more than a thin case to protect it, no issues whatsoever! i hope it lasts a long time!
my son ordered one of these and had no problems with it. it worked on the verizon network without a problem so i ordered one for myself. when i tried to activate it the verizon network said that it was not compatible with their network. so it depends on which one they send you if it will work or not and unfortunately you will not know until you get the phone.
3rd month with phone and its progressivly gotten worse. phone does not come with all features of normal s8 plus such as wifi calling, as well as some camera features. it also drops random calls, as well as won't let people call you randomly. spend your money elsewhere
listen to me right now when i say the s8 is a good phone. holy crap its amazing super fast hd display this phone is beautiful! mobile internation llc is a trustable place to buy your s8 look at the seller he sells new s8's with no lies or gimmicks. the s8 got here in one-day i'm playing around with it currently and i'm sure it will gather a lot of attention. if i have any issues ill post them here. this is the type of phone you want to show off people.
so far so good  the only thing iv noticed that seems to not be the best is the battery life, but honestly upgrading from the phone i got last year to replace a broken one, it's so so so much better. i'm very pleased, i was so scared to buy it off amazon, over all a great phone
the phone is amazing but samsung is still forcing bixby on it's customers. if you don't know what bixby is, it's a personal assistant created by satan himself. it is the most infuriating piece of garbage ever and you have to jump threw a ton of hoops to suppress it in your phone, you can't actually remove it.while the phone itself is amazing i would consider a pixel xl. hell, after dealing with bixby i wish i bought one !
i could not register the galaxy s8+ with samsung.  i called and gave samsung support the information on the phone.  it turns out i received the uk version.  it can not be registered in the us.  temperatures are in centigrade and i bet some distances are in kilometers.
the phone is amazing and everything i expected. this review is to confirm other reviews and share what i had to go through to get this phone activated through verizon.i took the phone to verizon to get a new sim card (old note 4 has micro sim, this phone has nano sim) and the verizon employees said it was not verizon compatible (error messages came up when they scanned the box) and i had to contact customer service to see if the phone could be added to the verizon database. the customer service employee was very helpful and reassured me that the phone was verizon compatible and everything looked good with the phone in their system when she looked up the phone's id number. they mailed me a new sim card and walked me through over the phone on switching the new sim card. everything worked well and my phone works fine on our verizon plan. i saw other reviews of people in similar situations and wanted to confirm that verizon's customer service was helpful and this unlocked phone worked for me on our verizon plan by going through these steps. the verizon store employees either do not have the power in store to recognize the phone or they tell you it is not compatible to try and get you to sign a contract through them and spend more money. going through customer service was the way to go and within 4 days of getting the phone from amazon, i got the new sim card from verizon and my new phone is working great!
pros: this phone is not completely outdated as of yet and is still extremely functional and affordable. i had been an iphone user for many years but their idea of trying to get people to upgrade by killing off the battery and making apps not work because a phone is 2 years old is ridiculous. i refuse to pay $1000 for a phone.cons: this is simply my opinion but it really has nothing to do with the phone itself. getting used to working an android os again.alongside with amazon payment plan, you cannot go wrong with this phone.
overall pretty nice phone. being water resistant is a major plus, and the fact that the touch screen still mostly works while wet is amazing. it kind of stutters and lags a tiny bit which was disappointing. battery life is hit or miss. sometimes it lasts 2 days, and sometimes less than 1. obviously that should be my fault for using apps that drain the battery but i can't figure out why it happens. i'm not a huge fan of the wrap around screen and it makes me really paranoid since almost no cases actually protect the sides. it could be cool technology when they do a 360 degree wrap around screen that covers the back as well, but in its current state i don't really get the point. it does look pretty though (is that the only point...?). glare is kind of an issue. bixby is completely awful and i can't believe samsung locked out the button so people can't reprogram it to do something useful. i don't get why they're competing with google on that front, and also don't understand why they're competing in the cloud storage market. another wtf decision is why they include an awesome amoled screen but don't take advantage of the power saving features unless you install third party black themes.major concern: samsung premium care will not cover phones purchased from amazon, but they will still accept your money. super scummy move in my opinion. there was no mention of it until i asked a rep (and good thing i did).despite my many complaints about samsung's strange decision making, the hardware is pretty good and the stock os works well with some tweaks.
just received my new phone in the mail! looks real nice! just found out that i have to have a sims card from sprint (my service provider) in order to use it! fortunately, they told me the sims card is free, and that i can either order one or go to the store and get it there! we shall see!
just got it and activated it a few days ago. i had to go to the metro store and pay to get it activated (wouldn't let me do it online fur some reason), but it does work for metro. haven't tried the facial recognition yet, but the fingerprint seems to be working fine. overall the phone is functioning the way it should in my opinion, but of any changes occur i'll try to remember to update my review.
i switched from an iphone. took a day to get used to android and then i just felt free. the phone is light and thin with excellent screen real estate, fingerprint scanner, and a great camera. i was able to move my sim card directly to this phone without any interaction with my carrier or their website. samsung also provides a smart switch app that transferred most of my content to the new phone via usb cable. the phone comes with an adapter so you can just use your iphone cord if you have one.
this phone may be good but i wouldn’t know because i received a box that only included headphones and a cord. on top of that, i am told that i have to wait three days for them to complete an investigation. to say that i am pissed would be an understatement. as a paying customer, i expect more. the issue is between the warehouse and the shipper, and has nothing to do with me, yet, i am the one being punished.
sad.  was looking forward to this phone and and opening, there were 2 piercings on the screen.  guess buying from at&t is better?disappointed.  2nd item i have returned from amazon in the last 5 years.
for the most part this is worth the money.  there is a slight scratch on the screen that isn't noticeable unless you try to look at it. other than a small scuff on the top edge of the phone (which you can't see with a case on) it is in great cosmetic condition.  now the battery life is ok but not great.  auccu battery says that only 2,879/3,000mah is being used so my battery life isn't as what a new phone would be like. the battery also gets a little warm while playing video games such as pubg on recommened settings. but the thing about that is that the seller never told me that this phones battery was in the shape that it is in.
i was sent an international phone and found out there was no warranty. was refunded my money with no hassle. other than that this phone is a great phone. it came in the original packaging and seemed brand new but fragile so get a case and tempered glass protector. i will be re-buying because i loved it . hopefully i will be sent the the proper phone this time.
nothing wrong with this unlocked phone itself but it was not totally compatble with verizon. advanced calling features such as wifi calling, hd etc are not available. also no 4g or 3g only lte. i do not recommend purchasing if you have verizon. had to return phone and buy a phone with verizon software.
i should have spent more time looking into this phone. if you search - galaxy s8 searching for gps - you will find at the samsung support site entries dating from 5/11/2017 to today(2/6/2019) about its inability to function.  i have tried the vague solutions they offer without success.  rare times after hitting start on google maps the directions work for about a minute or two, but never longer, and usually not at all. messaging, email and gps directions are what i purchased this phone for. avoid it if you need gps. understand this is not directed at the seller, the seller performed as promised, quick delivery and as advertised.
the phone was directly from amazon warehouse and was original. the weight and feel is great . set up was easy. the was glitches so far or spontaneous restarting. touch is good. there are lots of new features. the only problem was that notifications did not come in in real time in sleep mode....but, after digging around on the internet, i discovered that the battery usage and saving feature in special permissions was the problem. works fine now.
bought this for the wife, as she had an s5 with 16 gig...and she was out of space and her text messages wouldn't come in.  this s8  is awesome, the only downside is the stupid bixby app(lost a star samsung because you can't reprogram it)...would be nice if you could reprogram the button to launch a different app...
phone works great so far. i didn't realize it came with a screen protector installed on it so i kinda freaked out when i thought the phone was delivered with a crack all the way down the middle. but i figured it out a couple days later, removed the protector and boom, perfect screen.
got this for my brother as a reward for a great school year. paired with a case, this phone is the amazing for it's price. holds up well on his end for gaming. on my own gs8 i have outstanding battery life and it's optimization tool just adds on to the great experience.maximum power saving mode is customizable allowing you to add compatible apps to it and manage things like brightness and cpu performance.no complaints here
the phone is great, but bixby is nonresponsive the majority of the time when trying to use voice wake up. i've gone through the setup multiple times, but it still doesn't work. google assistant wakes up with no problem so it's not the mic or me. also bixby works fine with the (poorly placed) bixby button.
i was so excited about this phone but what i got is an international version with non us adapter, i verified the imei number on samsung site and it says no warranty:(i have to return the phone now, such a waste of time :
i purchased a ""like new "" from amazon with the earth day deal.i plugged in the phone and immediately saw the difference in display from my iphone 7 and lightning fast response with beautiful curved glass.i was willing to forego a few features such as stereo speakers ,slow motion video and emoji characters to save over$300 compared to the s9 plus.after registration of my product with samsung , 9 months left on the warranty, so phone was most likely a return because someone ordered the wrong product then sent it back.
pros: the phone is fast.good battery life.very nice looking phone.display looks very nice.cons:  my hand would often unintentionally touch a part of the wrap around screen and close browser windows, apps, etc.  this happened often enough to be fairly annoying.several apps were buggy and would close by themselves or would just not work at all (such as cycletrader app).  there were some annoying quirks with the youtube app.the fingerprint reader is the worst i've used yet, it always took at least 3 or 4 tries every time i got my phone out.  super annoying.facial recognition on this phone is a joke.i don't like samsung's overlay on android nougat.  the samsung keyboard sucks. stock android is so much nicer imo.overall, for a flagship phone and even at a deeply discounted price i wasn't too impressed with this one.  i have a feeling i would be much happier with a pixel or the upcoming pixel 2.
so far, so good.  opened the box, put it the sim card from my old phone and was up and running in minutes.  nice phone.  beautiful display.
so far so good! it definitely feels good to use a samsung again after being stuck with an lg for a bit. my only complaint is that the shipping time was postponed and when i received my package the phone was extremely hot but this is az so that's out of anybody's  control.
outstanding replacement for my old samsung sii which started acting a little funny.  very clear screen, long battery life, and connects with the bluetooth in all my vehicles in 8 seconds or less and never fails to connect.
phone is fine. works like a charm. but when you go and register the product, the warranty is already expired (by at least a year or a few months). we ordered a replacement model and the issue remains the same. don't order.
the planned obsolescence of my s5 finally got to me so i bought the s8+ works good - wonder how long they will allow me to use it before they slow it down.
this is a pretty good phone and replaced a moto x pure.  it's sleek and attractive.  the hardware is beefy--64gb is more than enough for me.  and if i did need more, it's nice that i have the option of using a micro sd card.  the processor and ram have nice performance on apps.  some people complain about the fingerprint sensor being near the camera.  personally, i haven't had a problem with that.  nor have i had a problem with the bixby button, although it seems unnecessary.  the iris scanner, however, doesn't seem to work for me.  i'm just not using that function.the deduction of a star comes in samsung's software.  it's not bad.  but there are going to be times where you are banging your head in frustration--'why won't you let me do  ________?  or why won't you let me remove _______ from my phone?'  for some people, that may be bixby.  personally i'm using it in conjunction with google assistant and that seems to be working well.  but for those that don't want it, you really shouldn't need 3rd party software to remove it.  likewise, if you have an app that you prefer to use, then samsung shouldn't place a barrier to keep you from removing their version.  it was great that they included some apps with a new phone; i get that.  but if i want to get rid of them in favor of something else, i shouldn't have to jump through hoops.and then there are odd situations like samsung's built in game tools.  now i'm not a heavy gamer, but there are times i'll mindlessly kill some time.  but that stinkin setting was adding 2 extra buttons on the navigation screen in the corners right near the game's buttons.  when i finally managed to kill the buttons, i was getting notifications all the time when the game started-up as well as inconvenient places in the game.  it took a $2.50 purchase for an app called bk disabler to finally get rid of it.  it's not a lot in the scheme of things.  but man, what an aggravating experience for an otherwise solid & great phone!
best cell phone i've had. the colors are vibrant, the camera's great not to mention lots of features. i haven't used bixby due to the reviews but i'm fine without it.
beautiful. runs fast. worked well with a sim card transfer on verizon networks, instantly. lots of neat features like running multiple windows.flimsiest thing i've ever seen.i'd owned a droid turbo 2 for years that stood up to all kinds of abuse until the battery finally permanently died; this thing cannot stand up to common usage. it had a screen fracture in less than a week after a maybe two-three foot drop even with a case/screen protector on. if you can be rough on tech, avoid the hell out of this phone.
samsung android - you must protect yourself from google.  comes with bloatware.  this model cannot be easily rooted to get rid of the bloat.
bought this phone the other day as a replacement for a samsung on5 phone that only had 8gb memory but worked ok just slow. just wanted to have something better with more memory and a unlocked version. this phone seems to have some great features which i'm still exploring. the display and camera is awesome! a little pricey but in the ballpark with other competitors brands/prices. very happy so far.
just as advertised- like it alot!
beautiful phone, however if you use page plus this device will not work. i have bought 2 phone off amazon and 1 off ebay trying to take the cheap rout, but i am going to have to just buy this particular phone off the page plus website. i hope this review helps fellow page plus users.
this supposedly unlocked phone did not work for cricket. the phone was compatible, had a working cricket sim card, but simply did not connect to service. very disappointed. returned.
i purchased this unlocked galaxy s8 sold by amazon and i couldn't be more pleased with the phone. truly unlocked. the phone came with all of its accessories- charging adapter, headphones, etc. it arrived when it was expected(thanks 2 day shipping) and with no issues at all!as far as use, i love everything about this phone. camera quality is great compared to the phone i was coming from. the phone fits perfectly in my small hands. overall, could not ask for anything else!
i don't like that phones nowadays have to be huge but i guess that's what it is. i had to get a new one because my s5 kept breaking. this is one is really good though, i'm happy i went ahead and got it.
this device works perfectly as advertised. don't let the naysayers prevent you from buying this based upon the false notion it won't work with verizon, because all that was needed was entering the imei code, which is listed on its back, into the verizon website to order the necessary and free sim card.
this is the nicest phone i've ever had. i was worried buying something this expensive from somewhere other than the manufacturer but it arrived on time and in the original box. was a breeze setting up and the resolution is absolutely amazing
i love every aspects of this phone.highest equality materials; camera, screen, processors, and everything.well implemented software based on the top class computing power runs this phone seamlessly in any situation.battery is well managed by optimization tools so that during idle time this phone seems to don't use any battery.
nice looking phone that works well, but has the durability of tissue paper. $400 down the drain. shattered the first time it was dropped (approx two feet on to flat tile floor) even with an otterbox and the most expensive screen guard i could find. i will never buy a samsung phone again.
it was a gift for my husband, he loves it!!i have the lg 30 and he has the s8 the 2 top phones of 2017. out of the box, he had 8.0. remember folks, forbesmag. rated the s8  & the lg 30 as top androids for 2017.  his reviews  go far beyond.  the appearance . i always go by them.with my s6 ,ok i had 12 models , then i gota great one! but, if you buy from samsung, great phone, short on consumer service. know your facts n reasearch!!! dontwine.be happy!😃
this phone is great. i was able to save money because the price is less than what straight talk wanted for full retail. was able to activate on straight talk with no problems.
i love this phone, so many extras, so much fun and great pics.  i have been a samsung fan for years fourth galaxy phone and each is more impressive than the last.  this is out of the park. between camera, bixby, and battery life phone is wonderful.
i love my new phone!! i was apprehensive about buying an unlocked phone but it was brand new out of the box, i took it down to my local sprint store and they set it up for me, free of charge as well. i'm now trying to get my husband to upgrade his phone as well.
this is a quality phone, its fast, it has expandavle storage and it was created this year and is one of the cheaper flagships and although i prefer google assistant bixby does a good job at what it was designed to do. bixby can download apps for you if you are to lazy to type and that is basically all i use it for, otherwise google assistant all the way.
works great was worried that it wouldn't but in posting this review on my new phone!!!
love this phone.  not the biggest but after putting a temdan all proof case on it, i wouldn't want the s8+.  it would just big too big...and i'm 6'4"" with huge hands.
i moved from an iphone 6 to the samsung s8 because of the recurring battery issues. the first thing i noticed about the samsung s8 is the significantly longer battery life. the phone is not as user-friendly as the iphone, but that might be more a function of having been a longtime iphone user (my learning curve). the phone looks great, comes with a lot of great apps and is relatively easy to set up. there are some quirks that will take some time to get used to, but that's probably true for any new phone. overall it's a great phone.
so, the makers of this phone decided to add a personal assistant that pops up whenever you click a button on the side. i have everything integrated with google and have no need for another personal assistant nor any desire to test one out. but, i constantly accidentally hit this button, and this thing that i have no desire/need for constantly pops up, usually right when you're in the middle of something.""but why don't you just disable it?"" you might say. well, they make you sign up for an account and go through a whole process just to get to the screen where you can disable the button. so, after a month of aggravation, i finally decided to go through the hassle of disabling this stupid thing that i have not desire nor need for. well, ok, i finally get it disabled, but having to give it my personal information and such, and who know what kind of data it's gathering. not to mention power it uses, data it uses, and taking up a whole screen constantly to the left of the main screen. so, i decide to disable the app entire. well, there's like 4 apps it uses, and you have to disable all of them. but, surprise, samsung deliberately makes it impossible to disable.so, this all seems like a grand ploy to force you to use their personal assistant, and they figure that you've already bought the phone and won't go through the hassle of returning it, accustoming yourself with another phone, etc.. but take it from me, save yourself. get a different phone now.
every day i have to restart the phone at once to be able to use it. it keeps advising that i have no network registered when i do....it is frustrating at times
i got this on black friday and had the deal. since then it is okay. i however am a klutsy person so i dropped it myself. i didnt buy a screen protector because my brother whos a tech wiz said i dont need it but i now have a crack through the camera lense. other than that i love this phone.
i don't normally write reviews but i must say this was an extremely disappointing product. the seller clearly advertised this brand new phone as having a usa warranty and could be used in the us. the phone was bought internationally, making it unusable and not covered under samsung warranty. very unhappy and extremely annoyed at being lied to. product was also not sealed as the ""sealing"" sticker used for the product box was missing as if the phone was switched from the correct device.
i purchased this phone at the october 23 and i have in my hands now and is a incredible phone.i've been a little bit worry because my purchase is a verizon unblocked phone,  you know for the cdma theme but the cdma the phone is both cdma and the gsm network so i only put it the metro pcs sim and the mtropcs girl do it her magic and work very well and fast. of course  i paid for the new sim  and $15 dollars to fee
very awesome phone. i don't think i have nothing else to say. good design.
i just received my unlocked galaxy s8 today from amazon. went to verizon after work and had no problems at all getting it activated.. it took less time to activate than it did standing in line . cost me $10.00 for the sim card. i've read some of the reviews where people had a hard time at verizon..that was not my experience at all ! if you are thinking about buying this phone unlocked i say do it !! and i purchased the unlocked version, not the verizon unlocked and not a problem ! happy customer amazon !
the screen is a great size, it runs fast, its slick and sleek. and now samsung has finally allowed you to disable the bixby button! texting is oddly very slow but i can live with that.
item received on time. after a couple of days of use the speakers did not work anymore. the device has been restoring media for several days  with a current recovery progress of 11% (73 mb out of 656 mb), the wireless charger stops working continuously and the wi-fi connection also stops working with no reason. i have been out of country for a month and for this reason return time was closed.
seriously love this phone. it is my companion, and i fall in love with it every time i take a picture in nature. i live in a small valley, and i've never been more able to capture the beauty of it than with this phone. if you are on the fence, get off and run (do not walk) to buy this phone. don't pay over a grand on competition (cough cough ""x"") when this phone is absolutely incredible at almost half the cost. i could go on and on... but seriously, i love this phone.
great deal on a flagship phone without needing to worry about the carrier bloatware. i was pleasantly surprised that the ""used"" phone i purchased is basically brand new besides some fairly faint scratches on the screen. had no issues powering the device on out of the box, and it even came with a complimentary case.this is only receiving a star less because the usb c cable that shipped with it was broken on arrival. not a big deal, but a bit of a headache when you need to charge the phone.
came in time and was exactly what the website description said it was. didn't get a brick or a box of socks so im pleased.
awesome phone! it's beautiful, technically advanced, responsive and did not bring too much bloatware. i'v always had galaxy s phones and this is the best.
phone is not new!i payed $600 for this ""new"" phone a few months ago, this past weekend it stopped charging suddenly and wouldn't turn on, when i took it to a repair service they informed me that the item had been previously tampered with and that it was not new and that the warranty expired way before i bought it!now they want to refund me only for the amount the phone is selling now and not what i payed for!do not buy this.
if you have the money, go for it. high performances, great pictures, good battery life, and comes with some useful samsung software on top of the native android.the only drawback, is that battery optimization is so good, that prevent application like strava from running properly by blocking its background access to resources.! so, if you are planning to use strava, have a second thought.  still it deserves 5 stars.
amazing product!the only downside that i can tell  about this phone is the localiton of the fingerprint sensor.
came very fast! works fine, registered with samsung and it had the software to sync with my old phone. i just put the verizon sim card into the new one, turned it on and bam new phone. it's that easy
i like it ! never had this new an fancy before lol only thing i don't like is no voicemail notification. i don't know if its because it not a verizon phone which is who i have as a carrier or what ? also i had to go to a verizon store to activate they will say it wont work for verizon but if you keep on them or find a tech sales person who is willing to try an not just say no they can push it threw or whatever they do just takes a little doing on there part but it will work on verizon
phone speaks for itself.  only way to go if buying upfront - equal payments, no interest and priced right!
great phone, amazing picture quality and battery life. smooth processor and operating system. amazed.
fairly intuitive features, good size/weight, and thankfully bixby can be turned off. (disclaimer: i probably was easy to please since my previous phone was an s4.)
not the us that was advertised international version has no warranty
i enjoy it, been almost a year of use now and still works really well despite drops, etc.
the phone stopped charging within a month, now samsung won't fix it even though it's still under warranty and is saying i need to pay them $640 to get it fixed (wrote screen damaged which is not true the screen worked fine)
love my s8 best phone i've ever had hands down! they have awesome customer service when it comes to buying this phone from amazon my first phone sent out to me had a camera and screen issue but after talking to amazon about it i was sent a replacement right away.
great product at a great price during black friday, and was able to use my citi points.it looks and feels small, but the display is amazing.i also bought maxboost galaxy s8 case msnap and the armorsuit - galaxy s8 militaryshield and both work perfect for the phone.
a quien pueda interesar por este medio quiero inforlarles que el telefono samsunggalaxy que les compre el 5 de septiembre ya no trabaja necesito saber que tengo que hacer por favor demen una repuesta lo mas pronto posible ya que yo padesco de muchas condisiones de salud y necesito un telefono.
i had the s5 and this upgrade is making my life complete! i got this on cyber monday so im super happy with the price i paid! delivery was on time with no delays, faster than expected. i have had the phone about 2 weeks now and i love it. my sim card on my s5 was way too big, so i just went to the verizon store and told them i upgraded - sim card was $10 and i was outa there in 20 mins, they took care of setting it up too.
great price for a flagship phone, upgraded from google pixel and love the screen on this phone. best phone i've ever owned.
great phone, lots of features that going from a budget phone to something this advanced has kind of floored me on its capabilities and camera quality. order from a trusted seller and you're golden, all i had to do was pop out my old sim card, do a quick transfer of settings and contacts and i was done without ever stepping in a phone store.
im sure the s8 is a great phone, but i ordered from amazon warehouse ""like new"" and the back cover was not even glued on correctly and was already coming off during unboxing. it was a great price, but quality control is obviously lacking here. returning immediately.
got a new sim card from my carrier and was instantly up and running. very happy with the phone, face recognition is better than i expected.  phone is very fast.  battery life has been awesome.
i chose this provider because i wanted an unlocked phone from a samsung official provider that was advertised as being from the usa. i live overseas and it was important that i be able to use the phone in the usa and abroad. not only was the phone not unlocked, it was also made or sourced? from germany, so it was unable to be unlocked. buyer beware! this is not a trustworthy source!
i could not be more happy. this is where i will buy all my devices from here on out.
i did a major upgrade with this purchase. it is sleek and thin. the screen curves on the edges which was scary but after 3 days i'm used to it now. the battery life is top notch. played music at work through it for 8 hours and it got down to 78 percent.  the pictures are amazing and crystal clear. this is the best phone purchase i've made.
i got an s8 after seeing it get top rankings in consumer reportsamazing phone, it's a beast, can do anything you throw at it.anyone wondering if you get a ""real"" s8, yeah you do, i checked it with apps that see whether it's new or used, and it is factory new.
this product was sold and fulfilled by amazon and was advertised to work with any gsm or cdma network, including verizon, but it does not work with verizon. neither the local verizon store or verizon telephone customer service could get this phone to work with the verizon network. will return this product and will not purchase a cell phone from amazon again.
i live in turkey. bought this, sent it over to a friend in the us.it works fine with my carrier here. the packing was new, everything came out of the package as expected (charger, earphones, etc)just a reminder, if you are going to use it somewhere else, do not forget to buy yourself a plug adapter, since the one that comes out of the box is the us plug.handsome phone.. loved it
for me the phone is similar to my galaxy s7 but the smart design of the infinite screen is the best use of space.  i also like the freedom of being able to use another carrier when i'm ready.
amazing phone, been using it for 6 months and has no lag whatsoever. never crashed once. dropped our multiple times with and without cover never broke or cracked.
this phone is my new best friend and i dont need any human friends anymore because this little contraption is wonderful
phone randomly closes apps, freezes, returns unprompted to home screen
upgrade from a 6 year old s3 and the s8 works great. sound quality is good and reception seems improved.
great phone. great battery life. love that it still has an earphone jack.
original s8+ .....good quality headphone akg... everything described in the box was there....was a bit concerned with negative reviews but i had no problems
it came brand new with the original samsung box,and also included very high quality headphones
says unlocked when phone was received the box was not sealed and it was a tmobile phone. total scam!!
great hardware but two things that make it terrible. software especially phone dailer is terrible compared to stock android. you have to have a separate app just to check your voicemail with the s8 vs a pixel where it is included with the dailer and a breeze to use. it may not sound like much but spending extra time going to that app wastes a lot time over time.  also that bixby thing is terrible.  they won't let you turn it off without a samsung account that they use to track you.  it pops all the time but after a while you figure out how to get it to stop saying ""hello, this bixby"" and then you learn how to get it stopped right away. once again a big waste of time but at least it becomes less of a pain.  but really, why put up with any pain when this phone costs over $600?  skip it, keep your old phone if it still works or buy something else.
i bought this for my son for christmas. he loves it! it was easy to set up - he was able to transfer all his data, contacts, etc from his old phone very easily. the only thing we had to do was visit a sprint store to get it properly activated with a new sim card, but that was easy and free, even on the day after christmas.
paid for a used damaged package samsung 8 and received a brand  new samsung 8 unused and untouched.i have absolute perfect 4glte service with cricket wireless  since i got this device .best $400 i've ever spent
phone, new ,works ok- but it advertise w/us warranty - nope not happening, when log on to samsung tell you it not for usa distribution.  false, advertisement. this is an unaccepable practice.
this phone is amazing. pretty much all i can say for now considering it's just my first week. and for those curious, yes , this can be activated on metropcs. the process took about 2 minutes.
samsung galaxy s8+ is a very good phone. my review is all about the description, it  says unlocked, i tried to use it with boost mobile and it didn't work, i try online, by phone, and in the store. going to return it to amazon
that what receive in the mail .
he loves it! will get one for myself...hopefully, before my current phone has a ""seizure"" and stops working
amazon warehouse deal it said used-like new and this is a steal!
neutral. froze a lot. had lag. might be an individual issue. i did a lot of research about the phone and saw common complaints. i was really not happy with the purchase but deemed that it could have been an issue with the individual phone.
love this phone ! great storage , great pictures , great sound , quality build and feel, and i found it on amazon at a great price !
great phone overall but i was disappointed because the heart rate sensor on mine doesn't work. this is a feature in s health that i used often on my s6 edge
please don’t buy this product!
compact, light weight, very good picture, phone could be clearer.
this phone was a great disappointment.  after a few months the mobile internet stopped working. the phone carrier had no issues and wi fi connection reached internet. samsung kiosks or support were unable foc nor did factory reset. amazon and the third party seller have not responded to date
i ordered the galaxy s8 that was used in good condition. i was expecting for there to be signs of usage, maybe some scratches or scuffs, but the phone arrived in pristine condition with original accessories. i was very pleased with my purchase and the charging is amazing. charging only takes about an hour and a half to two hours, and holds a charge all day.
htc one, and asus zenfone 3 user. the quality of the phone, looks, apps, security iris scanner. battery life functions features. best phone i ever had. fits perfect in hand if you like a good regular phone.
phone wasn’t even unlocked
description stated this was an unlocked phone. not so! couldn't activate on the computer or at store!
as described and arrived quickly. it was exactly as described and works great. i use cricket and had no problem connecting myself.
great phone, just a bit pricey.  i guess you do get what you pay for.
ordered a refurb., which showed up and did not work!  highly recommend this phone and this company!
this phone replaced a galaxy s-iii. there are some differences to get used to and i wish voice mail was a bit more intuitive.
switched from an iphone to this and i couldn't be happier. the customization display alone is worth it because i do lots of photo editing and the space i have for everything is amazing! i feel like i'll never even be able to use all 64 gb
beautiful device. fits a little smaller in hand vs previous galaxy and runs just as smooth. aesthetically pleasing and the slightly larger screen is gorgeous. all black themes look so nice with this. would 10/10 buy again
my daughter she got gift on her birthday she loves her phone .
the phone came brand new and was still wrapped in box. i popped my t-mobile sim in and transferred my old data from my old phone and everything work flawlessly.
just love it! takes great pictures and with a straight talk sim card works great!
i bought this for my son. he had iphone before but he said this one is better.
i am still learning from a 6 to an 8 now they have the 9 out geesh... picture quality if awesome
good deal.  super phone...and a great update from s4.  battery life is very nice.
this phone is great. large screen, excellent camera, and a good value.  best phone i have ever owned.
nice phone. switched from iphone because it's a more open system and allows user to make choices but with that said it is not as intuitive as the iphone.  i also like suri much better.
perfect condition and extremely happy with purchase. the wife loves it
r button wasn’t working after a less than a week of usage.
great price and i love my samsung!! i will purchase online again!
great phone, fast, good battery life.however my hand will touch the edges when being use.for the price it was ok.
cannot get verizon voice mail or family base to work on this phone.  verizon says there is no way to add these services!  wish this had been clear in the description before i purchased.  i have found no voice mail app that will work on this phone!
i ordered two phones.  product delivered as advertised and on time.  i had no problem activating them to my service provider.
i love this phone.  it takes great pictures.
phone like new. if you told me this phone was refurbished i'd tell you you were lying this thing is immaculate!! i have verizon and i just popped my sim card in there with no problem and it worked right away. i honestly love this phone, worth every penny!!
i bought this phone so i could use red pocket mobile. they allow you to use any carrier you prefer. it's been great so far!
got this for my wife for christmas.... she loved it... she had never owned a high quality cell phone before and this one blew her away.  definitely recommend it... only problem is the s9 came out a couple of months later
great phone i love it!! but it does not come with an sd card so make sure you have a compatible one ahead of time!
great screen , lots more memory than my old phone, very fast processor. love it!
i got this phone a a bithday gift just 4 monyhs ago and it is already not working properly. the battery only charges up to 82% and dies right away.
great looking new phone, however my model was apparently special edition and could not be activated to my boost service
this phone was packaged as new, but could not be registered to our cdma carrier because it remained in contract with verizon.  completely unusable to us.
works fine, accurate description, no complaints!
awesome phone could only use either boost or cricket.
super good phone made the switch from apple just in time. buying it off amazon will still save a few hundred bucks opposed to getting it on a plan through carrier because the carriers total price is higher. so if you want a new phone and can to pay up front save some money and get this one.
this is a nice phone, beside all the detail about it. overall, you wont regret spending your money for this.
i am very satisfied with the product and the dispay seems like a 3d picture. i think i made a right decision from switching from i-phone to android. enjoing it. totally recommend. nice product with this price.
screen quality is great. battery is good but not excellent. overall item is good for the price.
love the phone i just dont like when the screen randomly changes color not sure why but other than that i like the phone
great phone, quick load, many apps fit, love it.  will add to info after a few months of use in order to confirm how well it's still working.
i bought this phone 6months ago and it still works great! i have changed different service providers and have had no problems like i've had with proprietary phones from the companies.
this was hacked and charged to me, i'm deaf and don't use one!
the improved battery life is a welcome change.  i can find no issues with this phone.
everything was amazing! at first i was kinda scared that i would get scammed, however it came like it was brand new! the only problem was there was a little scuff on the bottom of the phone but it was really tiny so i can barely notice it. thank you
the phone was advertised as compatible with all gsm and cdma carriers, which should make it compatible with verizon.  however, it was not compatible with verizon and i had to return it.  the phone was advertised as new, but it might have been refurbished (text on the phone was in german) and the gsm/cdma carrier info may be false advertising.
don't be scared to buy this phone. this will work with verizon. i went to a local store and the dumb sales girls gave me a dirty look and said it won't work. i asked her to still try. she typed some numbers and told me it's not working. so i just bought a sim card from them and called verizon customer support. the lady that was on the phone got mine to work with in 10-15 mins.so if you are worried that this might not work with verizon, don't be scared. it works. just buy a new sim card and call the customer support instead of going into a store.
phone was not brand new as advertised even though i paid for a brand new phone, sim card tray was defective on arrival, i had to buy a new one, battery began to inflate after 3 months, cost me $150 to replace battery. now, i cannot answer incoming calls or call someone except is is on speaker. it was a scam, i was sold a used defective phone
like it, still learning how to make use of all the options.
remanufacture with brand new finish..only the charger is cheap...a lot of phone for the price
product came like new with no issues! easily activated at the verizon store. i'll update this review later with more details about the phone itself.
the phone!(c'mon, do a little research)
love it. came on time with all its accessories.
good phone ...edit i've had for about 5 months and it won't work no more
the phone is great, however boost kept trying to refuse to activate the phone under grounds it wasn't eligible, but when i put the sim card in the phone it bypassed that nonsense and activated anyways. great phone so far.
for some reason, my phone comes not sealed or anything. furthermore, the edge screen isn't responsive at times.
love this phone. great quality. will probably purchase more samsung products in the future.
it works. i got it for sprint. i went to the  sprint store because they needed to use a different sim card, but it was done for free.
quick shipping, great phone
i was really apprehensive about spending so much on a phone from the internet after buying store phones for so long. definitely new! best phone i've had in years! glad i took a chance! mind you i bought 2!
really nice phone i have dropped twice without cover  while i was waiting for my cover and has had no damage. plus really nice camara default down fault censor botton is net to camara but i will get use to it
i love this phone so much! best picture quality i've ever had, and loving the wireless charger. the setup is easy to use and i'm enjoying the samsung benefits
easily the best android device released in 2017. a few software quirks and slow updates keep it from 5 stars.
the phone is good, but the charger stopped working after some months!
phone doesn't heat up, it's very fast, its camera is outstanding, you might want to concider get a good case to protect this baby.
works with prepaid at&t. the battery lasts a long time, and the screen looks excellent. nice and bright.
perfect...... i was kind of sceptical about it because of the bad comments but thank goodness i didn't take them on and i ordered it.
great phone. switched from ios to android and love it. this phone has all the specs of an iphone plus more. the display is absolutely amazing. can't go wrong with the galaxy line of phones.
great product for a great price!
it came perfectly
i love my samsung galaxy s8.  i love the smoothe design, the camera, just everything about it suits me :)
my galaxy s3 was getting 'tired' and slow. bought this s8 the same week that samsung announced the s9 and got a heck of a deal on amazon as retailers wanted to clear their inventories of s8's.  very nice phone with lots of features i'm still learning about
yehaa!!!  loving and 'learning' my s8!!
amazing cell phone. fast delivery. amazon has just made a amazing job, i will recommend to all my friends. the cell phone arrived perfectly.
5++ stars. brand new and high quality product. best performance. fast shipping. best seller.
i love my phone, it was easy to set up and came with all the accessories
excellent product. works well
works perfect
one word amazing
👍
great phone at best price available at the time, haven't had any issues.
everything is amazing about this phone. camera, android oreo update, and features. very similar to the galaxy s9. unfortunately i had to return the phone due to it not being compatible with my phone carrier. i would recommend purchasing but make sure it is compatible with your carrier before buying.
the best phone i have ever used... great battery life... beautiful screen just love my s8 plus.... only  thing is have to keep it fragile as the body is all beautiful  glass.. rest everything is deluce
i absolutely love this phone it is everything you think it is and more
so upset i receive the package with things i never order. so i order this galaxy s8 phone i order a case and a screen protector none of those item i got in the box when it arrived i open the box and it had random things that i never ordered and no phone!!!!!just an empty box
don't buy this  phone if you want to use the camera. the camera have errors, samsung support tried to fix it didn't solve the problem. samsung service center replaced the camera, worked for a few weeks before we got the same error...
awesome phone
love it
evesamsung galaxy s8 unlocked 64gb - us version (midnight black) - us warranty everything i expected but it's my 1st. i phone. i'm still learning but so far it's great.
my first android device, lovin it!!
i cant belive how great of a deal this was. i purchased for my 12 year olds birthday. you could not tell it was used at all.
the picture quality is great, camera is great and the speed of operation is much better than any other samsung phones. all in all this is a great one.
great quality for a great price. very satisfied with my purcahse
can get enough of it , the camera is gorgeous, and the cpu runs smoothly.
this phone is amazing
this is the 2nd s8 plus that a bought 3 amazon and both front cameras did not work i am very displeased
you wonder why i chose a 1-star rating? well, well well...one day after getting it, turning it on, installing some apps from my old phone, getting a new sim card, and finally using it...i encountered an unrecoverable black screen of death. i tried every button combination i could find, and nothing worked.i watched the black-screen happen too...and it was charged. now i'm up at 3am writing a review for something i now need a refund of.
love it i had a s5 and love the camera the speed
no complaints save the standard, ""where did they move this or that to?"". used for personal and some business. a good product for a much more reasonable price.
bought it months ago after clinging to my s4 for too long and i am in love with the many features.
i wasn’t listening others when they was listening me... they should check the phone before sell it...
great phone.  love it so far. !!!
international. does not work.
works great. as described. it took too long to get supposed to be 2 days. got it in 5.
so far so good, no problem updating to my service. .
personal phone
this particular model does not work on the sprint network. returning it.
in screen burn on amoled was mentioned on product description. what was mentioned was full functionality but where the burn in is located doesn't always registrator. will not being buying again from this supplier.
there is paint chipping off the bottom two corners. looks like i'm sending it in.
now is cheap when galaxy 10 is out
hope i can cut through all the confusion posted here about verizon compatibility.  this model does indeed work on verizon's network.  when i received the phone, i charged it to 100%, but did not turn it on.  i then took it to a verizon store.  after a beat down by the salesperson for buying an unlocked phone online, she proceeded to warn me that lately, verizon has been ""refusing to activate unlocked phones"" not purchased through them.  however, after standing my ground, the salesperson backed down, retrieved a sim card and activated my new s8.  be persistent!awesome phone with wonderful features - and pretty snappy, too!  everything is working great.  it is nice to own a phone without all the bloatware pre-installed.
too small for men hand.
this is a great phone. cheaper than usual price but quality is excellent. so far i have no problem with the phone.
product performed as advertised and expected.
awesome phone. always bought $100 phones as to not being on a plan. now that i could afford it i upgraded. couldn't be more pleased. speakers are great. screen is beautiful. phone has enough weight that you dont forget it's in your lap.
not happy...for the 1st few days phone worked as it should. now it is acting like it is schizophrenic cant get back to the main screen without jumping through hoops and it is acting random. tried shutting it down, rebooting, to no resolve.  not sure why it is acting so strangely.
my mom loves it. i hate it, the sound is so good and loud that i always hear what she’s listening to. it barely weighs and all together it’s a really nice phone
superb phone. worked with straight talk
very nice
s8 is a good phone. no complaints so far. works as expected and goes above my expectations
absolutely amazing i got this phone for my mom cuz she had a new phone from the ancient egypt time she can't get off of it work incredible performance incredible damn good phone
came in great condition
i really like this phone. the sound and picture are much better than my previous phone.
long time iphone user. this is my first time buying something else.  bought this phone and fell in love.
wow it's ""like new"" lol but i was worried i'm very happy with what i got!
husband loves it.  he has had it for months now and it works great.
the product came on time and package came well-protected with all original accessories.backstory- is  that my s8 plus fell and broke and i sold it and bought this to replace it . i am please with my purchase. i was a little worried but all worry has been rrlaxed.
it's a great phone, marvelous design and fast. been almosto two weeks with it and is really great, only complain is the location of the fingerpprint reader, i guess for the s9 will fix the location.
as an continuing samsung customer, i have always been treated well by the devices i've bought. the s8 is a beautiful piece of work that i've become attached to and it is the best mobile device i've owned this far!
love this phone. still had to go to the carrier since its sim card is smaller than micro
nice features and great camera
i am glad i got the phone from this seller. as expected.
phone is great all arounder for the price. galaxy phones do hold up well. just found the $100 akg headphones are faulty and the right earbud doesn't work. pretty bummed about it as it is part of the experience as this phone still has a headphone jack
amazing phone with good price!i got this phone win original box with full accessories.
great phone
great overall phone. the specs are amazing. i have owned this now for several months and no problems.
beautiful device. item as described, brand new in untouched packaging. set up was super easy, especially with the adapter to transfer data from my old phone.
item is perfect as advertised. drove to verizon to get a new sim card and device works flawlessly.
old and fake samsung galaxy
just got new phone in today. works perfectly and i love it.  much better upgrade than old android.  came on time and with charger+headphones.  sim card for verizon had no issues.
great product just had problems at first with it but downloaded cover 4g lite network mode on the play store and havent had a problem since. the problem was it would do a glitch screen and then shut the screen off.
wonderful!!!!!great buy
brand new and unopened product. the rest is on specs!
compré este celular pero me solicita una clave para desbloquear la red soy de ecuador me pueden ayudar
very satisfied with product and transaction!
phone come in a really good condition and works perfect
perfect. great phone at a great price. my unit was brand new, sealed with everything you'd expect. also unlocked (and doesn't lock to the first sim) this really is a great deal.
not a clone. works great
i just received this phone today, came in earlier than expected. i am amazed with this phone, everything about it is so good. i was a bit nervous about buying it online but after receiving it and starting to use it i am so glad i did it
so far it is very good phone...my only question is...why the tax is very high!
great
arrived on time and is unlocked.  just perfect!!! totally in love of my new phone.
great phone, super fast and stunning display. streams movies without flaw.
good product samsung supplies as the other products.
awesome seller!  delivery does require a signature so next time i will have it delivered to my work. the phone is awesome.  it's in perfect condition and the price was great. i'll be back!
great phone great price!!!!
bought this for a friend, set it up for her & it's 💯👌 great buy
not compatible with verizon!
a great choice. still working flawlessly
i had this phone for little over a year, it works like a gem. camera quality is great so is the sound quality. touch is up to par and side buttons work very well. i've had no problems whatsoever since i've gotten it.
the best android phone now.
hi,i realized that sound of this phone automatically slow and within few seconds it turn normal. for example if you put google map in your car and hear the normal sound for map but after few mins it reduce sound automatically . not sure if this is a bug in this product.thanks
the dock and charging cable are not working.
great phone.  i'll never buy another phone from a provider.
great looking phone. the size and finish of the phone makes it easier to handle than my previous s6. the use of face recognition to unlock the phone makes a snap to open the phone. the placement of the fingerprint sensor is awkward and it should be moved to the front of the phone somehow.
love this phone! good capacity, takes great photos and videos with a variety of settings and options.
sim and sd card from at&t s3 express inserted and galaxy s8 unlocked automatically initialized to existing account within minutes -- no trip to store required.  much better $ for new phone than bstby, etc.
this phone is one of the best phone i ever had i'm very happy with that but the best thing is for the internet and videos and pic.
i was worried if it would be usable for me living in japan, but i was able to easily get a sim card for it and it works well. it is what it said it would be so i am satisfied.
the phone is not water resistant like they advertise,  i dropped it in 2 foot deep pool for 5 seconds, phone stopped working after that. unless company that sold it to me had it previously opened.
exactly as described by the seller and price with the included accessories was great!
decent phone
love it
looks fine.  i saw some unboxing video from youtube which shows the box is sealed with a sticker.  but some other video doesn't have the one.  i don't understand why the manufacturer distributes different package for the same product.
absolutely love this phone just received it yesterday. i am still exploring it is sleek fast,love the camera features very easy to transfer files to old phone to this one..no problems activating the device
great phone, very pleased.
could not turn ln
love the phone. my only complaint would be that the charger it came with died within 5 days.  :(
everything was perfect until i got the notorious wet charging port error. now i can only use wireless chargers
another great phone by samsung
not easy to retrace voice mail, should have app on home page to make easy
little slippery without a case given the rounded edges, but very happy with phone.
i'm a samsung person, so i'm very comfortable using this phone. it is good quality (sound, image, camera, etc) and easy to use. i bought it without doing much research ahead of time, and i'm very happy with it. i recommend it.
i have been using this for a couple of months and it really has impressed me on what it can do.  they were so many features i discovered that i did not know even existed like dual speakers and edge lighting.  this really is the best phone you can buy.
from the feel of the phone, the aesthetic design to the sharp response. this phone runs tons of app concurrently without a hiccup. i highly recommend it.
i am having a hard time settin this up. the volume adjustment on incoming calls  is a problem.
best phone i ever owned.
new as described. activated with verizon with no issues, just needed sim card. battery life seems normal for now and will update if needed. good buy.
muy buen teléfono
design is amazing but i put a case on anyway. bixby is useless. i miss some sw features of the stock android.
got the phone for 550 which is a steal at this price
super duper product
excellent phone, good apps available, no  loss of any functionality, in fact it's better than my iphone 6 i got rid of, good camera.  very happy owner.
lol love the phone. it has everything and now it's got android 9 pie. the seller's name is experttechs. it came exactly as described. no scratches anywhere. i was able to register it no problem. i'm happy.
happy !!!
love my samsung!!  always have and always will  :-)
great phone. haven't found anything i don't like yet.
this is a t-mobile phone, not an unlocked gsm
i've been loving the phone. haven't had an issue yet.
absolutely love this s8+ us version highly recommend
very satisfied,  and excellent price.
i’ll keep my iphone but it’s ok i guess.
fast, smooth and clearer than the previous phone (google pixel).
love my new phone. it is what i expected.
awesome phone. works great on my verizon network. had to buy a verizon nano sim card and activated the phone from myverizon website.
best phone i've had in 4 years.
very good phone. i bought a factory unlocked phone, which in my opinion, is much better than a carrier (at&t or verizon, etc) unlocked phone. none of the carrier apps and stuff is preloaded.
great phone and price. took it to verizon and they activated it for me and transferred all my stuff into my new phone.
came and works what can i say
great price for a used s8!
first off, from a hardware viewpoint this is an amazing handset. stunning screen, sleek lines, all the sensors you would ever need, and some of the richest blacks i have seen from an amoled screen. then ... samsung goes and mucks the whole thing up with gobs of horrendous software that they lock down and won't let you disable. i literally just wanted to change my wallpaper image and the software refused to let me do it unless i updated to a new samsung themes market where they try and sell you themes. i just want to change the wallpaper for pete's sake!and the bixby key? so many people don't want your bixby key, plus bixby makes it impossible to use google assistant from the lock screen. so samsung adds the option to disable the bixby key ... only if you jump through all the hoops, creating a samsung account, and letting them into every aspect of your phone. nonsense. just another data mining exercise. then there is the oreo update. i pay a premium for an unlocked, from samsung, handset ... then verizon and t-mobile handsets get the update first. really samsung?? you're so far behind that the telcoms are beating you on major os updates? a 200.00 xaomi mi is a recognized android one phone and gets the newest stuff immediately, but my 700.00 samsung is months late? seriously? if that is the case, then offer me a 50.00 usd plan to nix the special software nonsense and give me a stock android experience. no bixby, no 300 samsung apps that i'll never use, and no locking my phone down to what you want me to do in an effort to mine my software.this will honestly be my last samsung phone ... if i wanted a locked down experience i'd buy an iphone. there is a very good reason why companies like oneplus, xaomi and essential are getting a chunk of the market share, they are giving the customer what they want. a quality handset that isn't hobbled by software and apps they don't want and can't disable.at this point, i plan to see what the oreo experience brings (if they ever get the freaking thing released) and unless they give us some control over the bixby button and the option to use google assistant like it was designed, i'll sell this junk and buy a oneplus 6. at least then i won't be controlled by a company, being told what i can and cannot do on a device that i bought and paid for. frankly, there should be a law that unlocked phones cannot contain software that isn't able to be disabled. i bought it, it's mine, don't tell me how to use it.
i upgraded from a galaxy mega 2 to the galaxy s8 plus. and this phone is amazing. amazon got it here in less than 48 hours and the price was right! thanks amazon
amazing love it!
amazing phone. i was so scared that it will be fake or something else because i read the comments. but it is not fake it runs amazing. best phone ever. i definitely recommend it.
excellent seller the phone is well described i'll buy again thanks.
less than 3 months in and my samsung s8 phone is already malfunctioning. i am unable to receive calls and at times, am unable to make calls.my phone screen also blacks out.
me encanta el teléfono, funciona perfectamente, no le di 5 estrellas por el cargador,carga muy lento por eso tuve que comprar otro cargador, pero por lo demás todo bien ,estoy feliz con mi teléfono
its a very good phone but the  battery became low very fast
this phone is very nice. looking a phone that is not on the expensive side, to this one would work. it has us warranty, everything samsung original. i am very please.
like everything about it.
great phone exactly what was ordered still in factory packaging undamaged
great product...
just had it a couple of months but this thing is amazing.
gran celular
shady. everyone had problems with this phone including myself. it fail after 11months when returned from samsung it was from sprint and now the device is locked! unthrusted seller
great phone if you like being able to run multiple apps at the same time along with all the other features it offers. so good i bought 2 at the same time cuz i wanted to enjoy it twice as much.
the phone is not unlocked. it is locked whereas it says unlocked
i was looking for a new phone and stumbled upon these s8s.i bought one and so far i am not regretting it.
for the first time ever, i received a phone exactly as it's described... ""like new""... thank you!
great
phone would not make or receive calls. spent hours with samsung and carrier to find out phone defective. poor product
could not be configured onto the verizon network and had to be returned.  otherwise, it appeared to be a great phone.
the phone is malfunctioning! bought it july 2018.
item as described...fasy delivery...satisfied customer...
great phone
definitely a great upgrade from my s6. love all the features, memory, signal, picture quality, and the screen looks great. i'd buy it again in a heartbeat.
works with metropcs. great picture quality and overall phone for price
excellent
very cool phone.
perfecto
i love how this phone uploaded everything off my s6 including passwords and everything was all set up. very seamless and amazing transfer!
excellent service, rapid delivery, got it in less than two days.had the latest and greatest iphones for years but got fed up with apple. it's everything the iphone isn't and 10x more.highly recommend.
item is fine a bit too pricey but we got a good working product no problems so far.
beautiful. easy to use, easy to start up. placed my sim card in, and began use. i'm with cricket, have no issues. beyond pleased.
i just purchased the phone and so far so good no issues
worth every penny.
product was received brand new with all original accessories in box . came unlocked , i am very happy .
good deal and perfect cell.
great price and works great
love the phone i got mine for 300 and mine came with a screen protector already on it thx dude lol.
everything i expected at a great price.
this galaxy s8, is wonderful, there is none like this. picture takes  from this phone is so clear as a crystal. you can use this phone for everything from a to z. it""s all about.
i love my new cellphone!!!
awesome phone
great phone & user-friendly
this phone is awesome. love the camera. very pleased
love it, looks great, no issues getting it synced with my carrier.
very nice.
i have been using this phone for 3 months now and so far it has treated me well.the camera is amazing and touch screen works perfectly.i couldn't have got a better phone at that point of time.
very nice
the quality is better than iphone.
works well
excelent product. i am always buying from amazon. 100% recommended
love this phone!!
i purchased the samsung s8+ from this seller. item arrived new in box and carrier unlocked (using with cricket wireless)  just as described. love the phone!
this was an unlocked phone from verizon. i was skeptical if it would work with my metropcs and to my, the transfer was perfect.
item is described as unlocked and compatible with all gsm & cdma carriers. however, the project that shipped is not compatible with verizon.
no words , one of the best smart phone,  i recommend this than the iphone s8s
excellent condition,  this phone works fine,  the screen isn't as responsive as i expected,  but but i got used to it.
the phone is a great phone! i have one and then my son wanted one for himself after he checked mine out. he loves using it for vr
excelente calidad y durabilidad
the screen, camera, and overall build are phenomenal.the samsung version of android is complete crap. the only version of android that should be put on flagships is the pure version, plain and simple. why does samsung still have a proprietary app for everything google already does so well? then i have to tell the phone that i want to use the google version for every default app. don't even get me started about the fact that facebook is preinstalled and can't be uninstalled. i don't even have a facebook account.. you can't remap the bixby button to google assistant without a third party app? i simply disabled it to prevent myself from accidentally opening that crap assistant. the software for a 2017 flagship is atrocious.one of the selling points of this phone for me was the sd card expansion option. i bought a 128 gb sd card and downloaded all my spotify music for offline use and all was good. until one day, about 2 weeks into owning the phone, the sd card reader simply stopped working. after checking out some forums i realized this is an issue that samsung won't address. this was the straw that broke the camel's back and i couldn't forgive samsung for all the things i didn't like about the phone. i sent it back within 2 weeks of owning it.if you want a pure android experience with great hardware, this is not the phone for you. if you're switching from an ios device, or simply aren't into customizing your experience and you don't mind not having advertised sd card support, go for it.
love this phone.
this phone is really saying something. i think it has taken me close to being able to junk all my other devices.  it is really, really good.
love this phone
great product. great screen. fast. does everything i need in a smartphone.
love this phone!
very good phone,i like it soo much, ty samsung and amazon.com llc;)
the phone is awesome, super fast and, very easy to use.
beautiful  screen..  lots of features......upgrade from my nexus 6p..  just transferred  my sim....up and running in two minutes.
urgent urgent urgent! do not order phone from electronic deals. they are not real and their phones are locked not directly from samsung factory. careful people.
item arrived fast. galaxy s8 open box. everything about it was brand new. great deal. very happy
fantastic phone so far, hope it will last me many years.
my phone came in perfect condition, with great ear buds too. love this phone!
nice phone, switched from iphone and can say the galaxy s8 is phenomenal. the price was great too, highly recommend seller.
still awesome
good product.
everything works great, nothing bad to say about this phone! i love it!
good replacement for an older samsung galaxy model
the price was great just
i love this phone but i dislike bixby i give it 4 stars out of 5
parese que no es original, tube uno a.terios y trae muchas diferemcias al oroginal o esta defectuosos. pedire mi reembolso
amazon came through again. no complaints ever!
i have verizon and as long as you buy new from amazon you will have no problems, great phone.
great phone no problems
was delivered sooner than expected
very very very slow. it is even much more slower than my previous phone huawei. it will be the last time to buy samsung
such a wonderful device.
really enjoying the great quality all around on this phone! arrived on time!
i was happy the day i got the phone and i am still happy today.  thank you.  better than a over the counter price.
i really like the phone but the quality you will get what you paid for. camera is not a wide angle.
really like the phone. all of what i expected. thank you.
love it!
product is inoperative in only a few months.
es una estafa.... llega el celular usado y bloqueado. porqueria que amazon deje vender a cualquiera.
amazing phone,  came two weeks early in australia i'm very happy
excellent phone. unlocked. works with all main canadian providers and their flanker brands. fast delivery.
like it
the packaging of the charger and earphones are less than to be desired
muy buen diseño y rendimiento diario.  rapidez en las aplicaciones y calidad de pantalla y sonido.
the phone was very nice. but the problem is the wifi. sometimes it cannot.detect the wifi and not working properly becuase it will automatic wifi off now i have to bring it to samsung service center
best phone samsung ever made. it has better sound picture quality and infinite display rocks. i love it.
love it.
i bought my phone new and got charged for it but i received it used. there is no warranty information inside as well.
best damn phone ever invented.
good
it came with accessories and a manuel book to help with the phone settings.
it’s really good but the battery discharge too fast
great phone and an amazing unboxing experience. phone came fast and it's truly 100% factory unlocked.
great product! the best cellular i have so far. best camera as iphone could be, nice space and sound.  really glad with my choice
still a verizon phone, not completely unlocked. i am able to use my at&t sim, but i won't be able to update my phone until i can somehow use a verizon sim.
love it. came in good condition. just trying to learn all there is about it.
product worked as expected. definitely recommend.
i suppose i can't quite figure out how to use my own songs as ringtone. any ideas?
everything advertised. from ease of use to speed and features. i can do everything from this phone. the best phone i ever owned. period.
wow! love it
i love my new phone. save over 250 my boy directly fro. sansung
i got the box for the phone but no phone inside, yet i still got all the accessories that came with the phone
i love it! best looking phone i have ever had.
very happy.
muy contenta. excelente y rápido envío y aparato tal y como la descripción decia
i bought this for my person and he loves it. it works very well with his joke as well he says.
best phone ever purchased. worth the money.
excellent phone. i like it. on time delivery.abate abtew
yah it's a cool phone where the screen goes around the edge of the phone and the camera is nice, but do you like to use snapchat or the internet? do you like to download apps then go on wifi? well with this phone you can't do any of those things. don't believe me? google it there are plenty of forums that say there are no fixes for these problems. a more recent problem i've discovered is if you're listening to music the music will just stop playing until you unplug and replug the headphones in.
new like i ordered but was tmobile not unlocked
got my hubby this for christmas.  and he loves the phone.  so far so good
it is fake there is no real phone packed with bands foolish
works well

excellent phone at a reasonable price.

perfect came with everything you need
liked the phone but couldn't make it work with a new sim card
arrived in great condition. no complaints whatsoever. just make sure to buy a cover. phone is very sensitive to falling.
it worked on my carrier, total wireless, and has given me 0 problems.
verizon employee at corporate store stated the phone was not compatible when i brought it in for activation and they scanned the model code on the back.  however, when they tried taking the sim card from my droid razr maxx and plugged it in, it worked like a charm on verizon network.  have been using it for days and love it.  strongly recommend a case for protection.
fantastic!!
everything ok!

this is a great phone. it does most of what it's supposed to and is a huge upgrade from my s6. took one star away since it advertises use of the fingerprint scanner as a means to take pictures with the front facing camera. it doesn't work. i called samsung support many times and even got a replacement phone. still didn't work. face recognition doesn't work particularly well either. iris scan is a better option and that works nicely.not the phone's fault, but getting this thing from amazon was a nightmare. now i have to return the second one they sent out because it's no better than the first and actually a little worse in some ways (home button not as receptive, bixby button finicky, and still no fingerprint shooting method). still happy with my choice, but 3 stars seems appropriate.

excellent phone thus far. looked brand new
great phone and everything i researched was included. great packaging and speedy delivery. only problem was that my landscape mode and heartbeat sensor doesn't work at all. not a deal breaker but still, you want top notch for your money. will continue to search for solutions but otherwise a great phone.
amazing device, have no complaints thus far!
love the phone or shipped fast and a great phone switched from iphone and would never turn back
hii was buying clean phone ,but i got previous verizon phone .the phone is not compatible with t-mobile.when i returned the phone i needed also to pay for return .in general i wasted my time and also my money.very unhappy.
great phone
works great
good! thank you.
everything looks great thanks
me gusto
first off i thought it was weird that the box felt light. so i opened it and the packing for the actual phone was all beat up.  and guess what, it was completely empty. there was absolutely nothing in the packaging where the phone was supposed to be. papers and all. i am highly pissed. never ordering again.
such a great phone to use.
buenísimo
this phone worth the money
great phone! had zero issues linking it to sprint.
i like it. good cellphone. no problem
like!!
it’s not even one year since i made purchase of this phone in november 2017.don’t know wheather i received defective piece or what...this phone turn off by it self.sometime it i see completely black screen while i am middle of something. this phone is literally waste of my money.i don’t know how to get my hard earn money back.
happy with the choice of phone and it great one to have.
excellent smart phone.
wonderful device. would buy from the seller again
says used but phone was brand new
it really is a beautiful phone, and probably in the best family of phones out there.the good:it looks amazing on the back and the screen. the curved display is very nice and only adds to the looks of the phone. the camera is epic and surprises me at every corner. the processing power is of course epic. being able to record your heartrate, stress level and blood o2 level is nice.the bad:for some reason you cannot change the notification sound, which is simply dumb. and you also cannot change what is on your lock screen, such as removing the clock, which is restricting.what i recommend is that if you want a new-ish phone, and don't want to play an absurd amount of money, watch the price of this phone until it is around 470$ and then buy it.
is good phone
love it
badasss
amazing
recently switched from and iphone 7 to the s8+. bought from this merchant and i am very very pleased with the phone. it came it today and there was not 1 single scratch anywhere on the phone. it looks brand new! would highly recommend this merchant!
1. i was using it fine. one day failed to start. 2. sent in for repair on 8/18/18. 3. just got it back on 8/31/18. 4. samsung did not fix it. the letter came with the phone said simply, ""unable to fix"" 5. called samsung. was on hold for 32 min. after several transfers, i was told there was a liquid damage. 6. how can there be a liquid damage when it never went near water? 7. isn't samsung galaxy s8 water resistant to begin with? 8. it took samsung over 10 days to determine that there is a water damage? 9. i have had many samsung products in the past. i have to confess it will take a lot for me to consider samsung again.
received this phone 3 days ago, and finally got the sim card from vzn.  apparently, this phone has an issue with not being able to send sms texts.  spent 2 hours in the verizon store trying to get it sorted out.  2 factory resets, and 2 additional sim cards - still will not send sms texts.besides the no texting problem, the other issues i found in the short time i had this phone is:-the new 'bixby' feature is a huge disappointment.  extra side button which is easily hit by holding the phone.fingerprint reader is in an awkward position on the back of the camera.  unable to use thumb print unless turning phone around.so, if you're just looking for an expensive phone without the ability to respond to texts, or constantly pulling up samsung's attempt at ai whenever you pick up the phone - then this one is a winner.  if you're looking to actually use all of your phone's capabilities - then i suggest going elsewhere.i've been with samsung since the galaxy s1 days, and this is by far, the worst phone i have ever encountered (and i even had the note 7 for a short time).  returning this pos.
very good!!!!!
would recommend to a friend.
good product.supplier and delivering was great.
excellent buy
i'm enjoying the phone..... thanks
good deal
no water resistant at all
good product and great service
excelent phone!!
boss!!!
i love it.  it's a decent step up from my previous galaxy (s6 edge plus).  the placement of the fingerprint scanner is my only gripe (next to the camera lens... really?) but the awesome retina scanner makes up for it.  i've read some say the retina scanner ""takes too long"", but mine unlocks consistently in under a second.this is a deceptively tough phone, but you'll want a case as it's pretty darn sleek.
ok so far
this phone has great capabilities and sleek design. even though i purchased the otterbox screen protector, i couldn't put it on and have the phone still work. as a result, when my phone was accidentally knocked off a stand that was about 18 inches off the floor, the screen cracked. now i'm getting flashing lights and i will have to replace the screen for $230. i've owned the phone for less than 4 months and it is already almost useless because of the crack that keeps spreading and the flashing light. this phone is extremely fragile and for the price, definitely not worth it.
there is nothing i can complain about.
i have owned the galaxy s2,s3, and s6(flat display). with all of those phones i was happy from purchase, to replacement (usually fleeting battery life). i have just purchased two(one for me and my significant other) of the galaxy s8+ phones, and am somewhat disappointed. i was reluctant to purchase at first because of the edge screen being forced upon me, but i could no longer deal with old phones. here are some of the things i have noticed.cons1. screen glare - when in lit areas i seem to always have a glare on one side of the edge. even in samsung's display pictures there are glares on both sides of the screen. (hard to be unseen once noticed)2. screen protectors - i have tried 3 so far none seem to like to stick to the screen well and two interfere with cases i've tried.3. cases - not a problem yet, but all the cases i have tried seem leave something to be desired in protection. a lot of the front of the phone seems uncovered.(very nerve racking, mostly due to curved screen)4. finger print scanner - why oh why is it on the back? next to the camera non the less. unlocking with single hand can be a little tedious. because hand placement for use, and unlocking it are different. kind of have to slide it around your had to do one or other. thick cases can make it hard to get proper finger placement.5. on screen buttons - i have had phones with them before, htc m8. after about a year the phone slows a touch, and they seem to take a couple seconds to appear. may be an no issue with this in the future.pros - (most other flagships are equal here)1. battery - very good battery life. after a day of moderate use its still over 40% remaining.2. speed - a very fast phone, little to no lag launching apps.3. os - i do like the samsung version of android over some of the other companies. probably because i've had so many of their devices.4. camera - very fast and great pictures. video recording is very high quality too.in conclusion, i would recommend looking at other options if you are on the fence about the infinity(edge) display.  i took a chance and do slightly regret it. i am currently stuck with the phone for most likely the next few months.only way i'll buy a samsung again is if,1. i can get a flat display again2. take the buttons off the screen.3. bring fingerprint scanner back to front.
great phone, great deal!!!
i'm happy with my new cell phone
unable to get cameras to work little help from zosi teck
great product.
i love it
love my phone!!
perfect
very good very good
nice size, getting used to it's function. just a bit different from my windows phone, which was very easy to use, just very buggie after the recent os update. nice display, quick function, just a bit of a challenge to navigate around the phone. imbedded apps are a pain, and slow the phone down. google got it right with their pixel 2. aftermarket products are hit-or-miss for the s8, as many cases for this aren't very snug-fitting. read the reviews for cases and accessories. some really suck.
good phone it works with boostmobile
receive a box with the ear phone and a little black thing.. phone was not in the package.. disappointed
this was the worst purchase i can recall making. run, don't walk, away from this thing. the android platform is what it is, and if you're looking in this space you are already ok with it vis a vis the iphone. the real problem is the casing. it is absurdly delicate, and the screen is so configured that it presents a fragile curved glass edge rather than a hard plastic rim. while this feature no doubt increases screen capacity, it means that there is a very high likelihood you will break the screen with ordinary use. to this day i'm not sure how i broke mine. once you do that, you are in a world of pain. you can't get screens from samsung as an end user, and if you go through an approved repair facility you are in for a wait of a month or so, and a total cost to repair of roughly half of what you paid for the phone. meanwhile, you don't have a phone. handy. if i could go back in time and pay money to avoid making the mistake of getting this thing, i would gladly do it. as it stands, i am probably going to write it off and get an iphone, from which i mistakenly switched in the first place.
update:  new phone has arrived and is working great. five starts for amazon customer service,  4 stars for the phone(the first one was defective but if not for that, would be five stars)like the phone while its working, seems to be quick and the pictures seem really nice,  i'm unfortunately one of the ones that have been affected by the constant restarting problem.  two stars for now since amazon customer service is replacing it,  once the new one gets here and it doesnt have the restarting problem(restarts at random 15-20 times a day) i'll update the score/review.
the best phone i ever had.
aaaaa+++++!!!
very cool phone! ultra beautiful i think
great phone !
fast shipping, and everything arrived in perfect condition. i absolutely love the phone and would recommend this product to anyone.
at first this phone was great! but over time the mic started failing. at first i fix it with cleaning out the mic but it failed again and again. the basic function of a phone is to make calls. so why samsung is my phone not making calls. that why i wanted a phone in the first place. also google ""samsung galaxy s8+ ok google cant hear me"" and u will see tons of people in the same problem.... this is so stupid
this phone does not work on sprint! tried to activate over the phone and in store! will not work! even tried with new and old swim cards! don’t get tricked!
i set it up one day one. on day two it started with a screen that was locked in with the message it was not connected . to give feed back or close it. it would let me do neither. screen was locked. could not power off or restart as tyhe message was over the icons to do it . i have a samsung five and t6hat i love. would avoid the 8
soooooo much better than my prior phone.easy to navigtate.still learning; easy to use.
i am angry i have been in love with the galaxy 8+ forever and  i finally was able too purchase two of them one for my son as a graduation gift and one for myself well i am do disappointed  the phone my phone of course has problems keyboard sticking and will only clear after a restart of the phone,  duration time doesn't work on five minutes or ten minutes and some other things,  like really this is supposed too be the tops of androids  i am so  sad i called samsung and the could see the phone had issues they did the trouble shooting and had me also do a process of course it didn't work so i am over the explosion of the galaxy 8+ and one other thing it's a problem with the samsung wireless charger it sits on the charger for 30 minutes or so and barely charged 10% like it's nothing special about this phone but the over pricing had i just gotten the best product i paid too get i would walk tall with but it's mot right too take that hard earned money and give me an inferior product/ jenifferfoster8@gmail.com
for some reason even after i do the initial setup on this phone, webpages will default to chinese for a moment and websites that use location won't be able to verify my location. all of my settings are set to the us, gps is always on and i still have these issues. i feel since amazon lets a lot of knockoffs in their store that this could be one of them. still preforms decent, aside from that, but very skeptical.
very dissapointed, after 2 days, the  gorilla glass just got a scratch..., it s a shame for this gorilla glass , even my galaxy s4  has less scratch than this s8 got in 2 days of using.the product was good, but i am dissapointed about the gorilla glass
phone broke 6 months after getting we bought  a protection plan never herd from vender. know i'm out 800+ and i have to buy another phone for my husband
so many bugs on my phone.everytime i lock the home bar below it unlocks itself after a few days.besides that this is the first galaxy i've had that's tripping balls in the software for many things.
the ""fast charger"" charges very slow. my old s6 charges faster than this. also the headphone quality is very low. it cuts off if you move it a certain way. other than that the phone works very well.
the phone was sold to me as 'new' but it experienced black screen of death from which i was not able to recover immediately after installing.
the galaxy itself is fantastic. i love the picture quality, which is most important to me. apps and customization are also fantastic. another really important feature to me, as a data hoarder, is the sd card slot.just be careful whenever you purchase one off amazon, my carrier worked out but i didn't get a warranty as described.
there is no ir blaster!!!! seriously, why this hardware was not included in the s8 is beyond me. rediculous! this hardware has been included in cellphones for yearsss and has been included in samsung galaxy cellphones since the s4!!! smh. this was not a feature i thought i needed to research. i have utilized the ir blaster in all my previous cellphones to control electronics at work and at home, tvs and air conditions mostly, and i am incredibly disappointed to find out, after buying an s8, that it is not built into this phone.
i had high hope for samsung's flagship phone, but was very disappointed.the positives:1.  the phone has a headphone jack, an sd card slot, and wireless charging.2.  the phone is unlocked and has the transmitters necessary to work on all four u.s. carriers.3.  the wireless hotspot feature works even if you don't pay your carrier for the privilege.4.  the screen is sharp and bright, just like prior galaxy phones.the negatives:1.  no hard button on the front.  i really appreciated that the earlier galaxy phones that had a physical button.  i like the tactile feedback that a physical button gives you.  it allows you to wake your phone without having to look at it to make sure your hand is in the right place.  that tactile feedback is missing on this phone.  also, on this phone, to wake the phone you must press the virtual button twice, then you must swipe, and then you must type in your passcode/pin.  that means a total of four actions just to get the phone to the home screen.  that's just stupid.2.  no user replaceable battery.  this is simply inexcusable.  i know that they big companies want you to throw away your phone every two years and buy a new one, but that is incredibly wasteful and unnecessary.  there is nothing about the design of this phone that mandates a battery that cannot be replaced by the user.  it would have been very easy to design the phone to have a user removable rear cover.  even wireless charging can be accomplished with a user replaceable battery.  i had wireless charging on my galaxy s3 and s4, both of which had a user replaceable battery.3.  oddly sized:  this phone is too tall and too narrow.  as a result, it does not easily fit into my pocket and will fall out fairly easily as well.4.  oddly shaped:  the waterfall feature on the screen has an appeal that's similar to the appeal of curved tv sets.  initially, it looks interesting, but you quickly come to realize that it heightens glare and distorts the image.  in the case of this waterfall screen, it distorts the images at the edges.  it also makes it almost impossible to get a case that will protect the phone from screen damage when it is dropped.5.  bixby button:  bixby is a samsung's answer to apple's siri.  there's a dedicated bixby button, which is located directly across from the power button, which makes it super easy to inadvertently push when you're pushing the power button.  samsung just recently made it possible to disable, but not remap, the button.  but, in order to do so, you *must* create a samsung account, share some personal information with samsung, and link bixby to the account.  until you do that, you cannot get to the screen that allows you to disable the button.  again, this is stupid.  if bixby is so great, people will choose to use it.  samsung shouldn't need to force people to do so.in the end, even though i got a smoking $574 black friday price on this phone from amazon.com, i'm going to send it back and either keep my s6, or upgrade to s7 instead.
despite reviews, the camera is not very good. specifically, the native dynamic range is very limited, and the hdr feature seems to be faked in software (with poor results) as opposed to ""real"" hdr where multiple images are captured at different exposures and blended together into one.when shooting at night, areas around light bulbs are bleached. when shooting during the day in contrasty scenes, the blue sky is bleached white, even with the hdr mode on.my 2014 iphone 6 plus does not have a problem capturing the dynamic range of these scenes without bleaching, and takes much better overall pictures (despite the lower pixel count) because it has real hdr that works well.i even tried a 3rd party true hdr camera app. but, in the darkest exposure setting the areas around light bulbs at night are bleached. basically, the camera's hardware just doesn't have the range to do it.also, the camera has awful halo effects at night, regardless of whether i use the stock camera app or the paid premium one. streetlights, etc. have horizontal lines that run across the screen from end to end.i am thinking of getting rid of this brand new phone because the camera is so sub-par compared to my past iphones. in fact, my iphone 4s has a preferable camera in some ways because it does hdr properly.the 1080p video is also inferior to my 2014 iphone 6 plus. there is a notable lack of detail and contrast in the videos. while it is encoded as 1080p, apparently due to compression artifacts or whatnot, there is a notable loss of detail that makes the result look like a good 480p shoot.and the audio for video, while fairly good, is also inferior to the 2014 apple model. this is quite apparent when shooting at a concert.and, the s8 chews through battery rapidly, even with almost all app push notifications and auto updates turned off, and even with the phone in the middle battery saving mode with the processor and display throttled back. i couldn't get through a day in an amusement park without running out of battery.lastly, while the oled screen has stunning brightness and color gamut, the color accuracy is notably off. i found this to be occasionally irritating when watching movies, and it prevented me from accurately adjusting photos with photo editing apps.the phone is quite nice looking, and the iris scanner works better than i expected. the front facing camera the best i've yet seen. the cellular reception is slightly better than my old phone - i will get 1 bar in some places where i used to get ""no service.""good phone all in all, but the camera flaws are a dealbreaker for me.
love my new phone. it is taking me a while to learn to navigate everything on it.
this is my first ever written review, i was so dissatisfied i was compelled to write. i feel completely scammed and mislead by mention of the warranty. i went to register my s8+ product with samsung and was rejected. i attempted to register  using the s/n then imei. rejected both. i would have been much more satisfied with a chinese phone for a much cheaper price with zero warranty. i purchased this phone only for the promise of some form of warranty. wrong. nothing. where does one go now?
it's a nice phone only problem i have is the hd voice, wifi calling, and volte(voice over lte) (the feature that allows you to use data and voice at the same time doesn't work) but i love it i'm hoping this will change when i receive my replacement unit but i love it! and i love amazon! they have really impressed me! kudos to samsung and amazon!
to be honest, i purchased this phone june 5th and have had nothing but problems with it since i bought it. the biggest problem, the battery and charging problems. every time i let the phone get to 40% or less battery life, and plug it in, it automatically just shuts down completely. not sleep, not screen off, shut down. it has been crazy annoying but i dealt with it since it is the ""best phone out there"".next, the always on screen. sometimes it is literally always on. screen is on, at the main home screen, not the lock screen. anyone can get into the phone, browse away and make calls if i a not watching. also, in this state, if it isn't charging and i put it in my pocket, it actually heats my leg uncomfortably. the only solution is to hit the power button to put it to the lock screen. very frustrating but i dealt with it because it is ""the best phone out there"".now this morning i awoke to find the phone powered off. i assume the battery had dies so i plugged it in. normally, as soon as it is plugged in you would see a circle with a lightning bolt inside that appears, letting you know it is at zero percent but it is charging. the led light would also blink at the top....nothing. no led light, no circle with lightning bolt, nothing. i then proceeded to spend 3 hours looking on the internet, calling samsung, everything to try and rectify the issue. it just will not turn on.so now i get on the phone with samsung and they have me go through 20 minutes of attempts to resolve the issue, the same things i just spent 3 hours trying. still nothing. i also read in their warranty for cell phones (see attached screenshot) that ""during the applicable warranty period, provided the product is returned in accordance with the terms of this standard limited warranty, samsung will repair or replace the product, at samsung’s sole option, without charge."" so i figured they would just ask the woman to overnight a replacement of this 5 month old phone and i would ship this broken one back, done....nope. the woman on the phone refused to even acknowledge replacing was an option even though i read her word for word what the warranty stated. the only option was to send it to them, wait for them to fix it, and then send it back. all of which will take 2 weeks! i replacement can be shipped in 2 days!. i asked her nicely again to replace it as i cannot be without a phone for 2 weeks, no; she wouldn't even consider it since she didn't believe it was in the warranty in the first place. after a 3rd try to get her to understand she simply got quiet as she refused to even discuss it with me any longer. very disrespectful and lack of understanding of my situation or their warranty apparently  but also very disrespectful to a customer who has spent a fortune on samsung products.so now i am sending the phone back to samsung to let them spend 2 weeks to repair and send it back. in the interim i plan to buy another phone that will not be samsung. i have been a samsung fan for 4 years now and have spent close to $20,000 on phones, tvs, all new kitchen appliances. to be so mistreated after all of this loyalty is unbelievable. after tolerating all of nuisances with this phone and then to be told they cannot replace it but it must be sent in for repair for 2 weeks is just unacceptable. this is the reason why samsung has peaked for me and will now be going downhill. as far i am concerned there will never be another samsung product in my home and i will actively tell whoever will listen to stay away from this company who does not respect their customers loyalty.unless this company makes this right i will get the phone back ,sell it and never even consider another samsung product, period. the aggravation alone is worth 10 of these phones that cost samsung less than 300 dollars to manufacturer. losing a 20k customer is going to hurt. further i plan to post this review anywhere i can so that as many people considering samsung products understand the company and lack of customer focus.
screen is very nice, and it is fast. the message app is bad, bixby is bad. why is it that after you type your screen un lock code you must press ok. i had to take it to a samsung service center to completely flash the software so my conversations would not magically go into mute mode.
was sent a defective device that only worked for a few months. so disappointed in this product especially with how expensive it was. wont be buying any samsung products ever again.
this phone has given me trouble since i activated it...which unfortunately was a couple months after ww bought it. by this point i almost never has service!!  i only had service and availability to use my calls, text, internet and google maps about 20-25% of the 9 day road trip i was just on. that's horrible.  my boyfriend only lost service a couple times when we were in the middle of a national forest (where you expect not to have service).  i haven't even used this phone for a year.
bought it 3 months before, suddenly phone stopped working. there is this famous black screen issue with samsung galaxy s8,think before making purchase
love the phone! currently in europe and works flawlessly with orange. when i get back to the states i'll have an updated review for my provider there. came in box with charger, headphones sim card pusher out thingy, and adaptors for micro usb connections.
this is really a great phone, there's not 1 thing i don't like!
i loved the phone but after 3 months of use i have now the black screen of death. i tried everything online to repair it but nothing worked i felt like i had been had. i had to go back to my old iphone 6 plus horrible purchase.
the phone was used not new like they advertise and it didn't work on my sprint account
if you a want access basic visual voicemail thru verizon don't get this phone cuz you wont get any notifications
great phone, amazing display. sometimes i’ve lags, but without influence on performance.
when you spend almost $700. for a phone  you should be able to expect to get what you ordered.  phone was not received unlocked.  got transferred several times and whoever i spoke to was unable to help. ( spoke very poor english and they may as well have been on the moon the connection was so poor.)  next time i'll go to the at&t store and pay more but i'll get what i pay for.  as soon as i return this phone that's where i'm going and get me a phone.  what a waste of time.
came with a stuck pixel in the left-center of the screen. it's extremely annoying and i've requested a replacement.
i've been getting samsung phones since the galaxy s1. but when i got this phone the bixby feature was a minor problem. after a month its gotten even more annoying the fact bixby would come up and whats worse, is we can not reprogram or disable that button. later on i realized there was a lot of other crap-ware samsung was forcing on us that would popup up as well. the worst was when i wanted to take a video and yours truly bixby vision came up and i missed the shot. there are other problems but all were minor what bothers me is the amount of small problems. unless in the next galaxy samsung stops forcing crap-ware onto their phones this is the last samsung phone i would ever get.
worked with my t-mobile simperfect for gsm the reviews had me confused people talking about verizon and sprint i thought it wouldnt work with tmobile but it does lte at is best
does not work with t-mobile, it was compatible with verizon when i received it. just an fyi!
big mistake you cannot connect to verizon, sprint, or boost. the phone is unlocked but does not work with certain carriers which really make the phone pointless making you switch companies just to get the phone to work. are we allowed to return this to amazon??!! us version my ass!!
the telephone was supposed to be brand new but came with a syndrome of glitches. i can't move the apps around on the screen, it freezes like a four-year-old device and fails to work like a new samsung should. i very much regret buying this.
you can't go wrong!
over priced smart phone it is what it says it is.. works great
just bought this as a graduation gift. i expect it will be good as i have one of my own.
at my house version is the only carrier i had any luck with signal strength. a must have so you don't drop calls or text. i never had any problems with my samsung  s4. when i got this new s8+  i really liked this phone . i hated paying that much for a phone but i keep them a long time . the huge problem i'm having with the s8+is the reception sucks. one to two bars if i'm lucky and it constantly drops calls and fails to send text. i really like this phone so bit the bullet and purchased a cell phone extender antenna for version . another $130 added and a real pain to install. after all this it's not better if anything it's worse.  is this phone worth it ? srue .....that is if you don't mind running out in the middle of the street when it's snowingjust to make a call. yes i'm being sarcastic and yes this phone is a joke!
don't get me wrong, the functionality of this phone is incredible. however, the phone might as well come with a broken screen. this is the first phone that i have ever broken. and within 3 months of owning it, i have broken the screen twice. both times were low impact falls from heights of about 2 feet while sitting. furthermore, it breaks through a case, which is even more baffling.the phone is absolutely beautiful out of the box but once it inevitably breaks, you're left with an item that you just paid $400 - $800 feeling like you're trying to wait out a contract until your next upgrade is available. it would be nice to just fix the screen that samsung should honestly feel ashamed about but that costs $150 - $200 unless you do it yourself. and then you are right back at square one with a new fragile screen not suitable for a device that is considered ""mobile.""i plan on coughing up the deductible to file an insurance claim on the phone. mostly because the second break occurred in a way that a shard of glass is now impressing the screen preventing me from escaping a black screen while on a phone call. it otherwise works but i cannot look at texts/internet or even hang-up while taking a call.i would strongly advise against buying this phone. even though i enjoyed my 3 months of use, i wish i had not bought it. its pretty disappointing that samsung is not remedying the fagility of this phone in mass. it's comical that a purchaser needs to constantly worry about a $200 bill while using this phone in a fairly standard way. the iphone x is also a frightening phone since it looks like the same design. i would be exceedingly hesitant to buy anything that even remotely resembles this design in the future.
sold me a black listed phone and did nothing to try and help out with the problem
something was wrong with the phone, continuously kept updating the software and restarting.
love it
very nice 👍🏽
charging problems within 2weeks of use. frustrating to say the least.
device was defective, would returened it if i didnt throw away the package it came in. would not recommend buying used. should of went with my gut. very angry
worker with verizon  only 12mp camera should have more
good
great phone which is to be expected with a samsung product. no complaints.
great phone looks amazing just the camera still isn't the very best i thought you can see everything clear that's obviously a lie because i can't
it did not work.
i received a locked phone when it clearly says unlocked phone in the add. according to verizon they couldn't activate it because it was locked.
bought the phone in last summer, and january 2018 i had to send it back already,  because the phone didn't pick up the network...i didn't have a phone for 12 days...previously i've  had a xperia z1 for 3 years and never had a problem with it!
so far so good. mom's enjoying her phone and have not reported any issues.
phone had scraches on it. the phone and the items in the s8 box were loose, no packaging to keep the cords, ear buds, etc from scratching the phone.
it's not unlocked. junk.
can't remember the last great phone i've had. the s8 is a fantastic phone.
i enjoy the s8 - it's sleek, got a large screen, and large numbers for my fat fingers to type on.  i'm still a terrible texter, but at least i'm less terrible on this slightly wider screen.  bixby does get annoying - lord knows i yell at it every time i accidentally hit the bixby button on the side, but i do love this phone.
ordered.arrived when they said it would.arrived in perfect order.fair price.no complaints whatsoever.
love the phone!
ohyeah.
this phone doesnt work! some day just die and thats it!
got a damaged product. the bixby button was broken. very disappointed. returned it immediately.
this is the last time i buy a samsung phone. i was an avid user of the galaxy s6, and i loved it, so much that i still have it and i use it as a replacement phone sometimes. this one however......crapped out on me after 3 months of usage....in an otterbox!!!!! don't waste your money, it is not worth it.
buenas tardes, el celular que recibi tiene rota la pantalla en la parte inferior por lo que solicito se me realice la reposición o se me ayude para poder comprar la pantalla que tiene un costo en ecuador de 300 dólares
my phone had something weird on the screen and when toke it for warranty they said it didn't apply cause i bought it here
like every  thing  about this  phone
the rear facing camera was completely distorted and about an hour after using the phone my sim card was blocked because the phone was blacklisted and reported stolen. very unhappy. returned immediately.
i got a phone without charger? what happened?
i purchased the unlocked version of the galaxy s8 plus. when the item arrived instead of it being the s8+ they somehow crammed a galaxy s7 edge in the galaxy s8 edge box. buyer beware!!!!!
excellent phone with incredible battery and it's extremely fast. it comes without all of the carrier bloatware and you still get 90% of all the features. worked perfectly by just inserting my verizon sim card from previous phone without having to go into the store.
great. best choice.
this phone is amazing and for the price that i got it here is even movers amazing. it literally cost almost $200 dollars less than in samsung's website (that was by the time that i bought it, it might not be true now, stuff change price all the time.)
too expensive but cheaper than an iphone and just as functional.
nice phone
what i like the most is the overall phone and all that it offers.  i gave it two stars because it lacks the critical functionality of wi-fi calling.  if this unlocked phone had wi-fi calling the i would have given it 5 stars.
it's good
poor buying experience. phone has been shut off
receive a phone with a scratched screen.
great product. bought it used was scared at first that it won't look satisfying but when it arrived i was amazed that there wasent a scratch on this thing. thank you so much
i had a perfectly fine usable samsung 5.  this samsung 8 is really nice. panic over elctronic price increases caused by the idiot con mans tariffs inspired my spending.  phone is wonderful though and i will be fine with it until 2020. my samsung 5 phone makes my granddaughter happy because she hated her memoryless apple phone. samsung makes great phones not cheating on the memory needs to use a phone like apple does.
all good.
shipping on time was horrible. other than that phone is really good.
great
perfect phone
works great..great product love it.
nice phone, 100% recommended
liked the edge to edge screen. but hated the bixby all. the bixby  kept  turning on day and night waking me up. so i traded it in for another  phone  even  though  i  lost  money  on the deal, i don't  get  woken all night long!!!!!!!!
the features are alright, but nothing amazing. the bixby button is just in the way and almost wholly useless. no screen protectors will stay on the damn thing and my screen was broken within 3 weeks because my kid leaned on the sofa and it slid onto my floor. my carpeted floor. this was a phone in an otterbox case with a screen protector on (i believe it was the 3rd i'd purchased in just as many weeks since they don't stay on.). i took it in since i paid for insurance and they wanted to charge me my firstborn to give me a refurb phone. i decided to call around and it's about $500 for a replacement screen.i'm not particularly hard on phones and always keep them in a case and with a protector because i don't like having to replace overpriced gadgets. the only time i've had a cracked screen in all my years of phone ownership was when the entire strap broke on my bag and my note 4 wound up with a cracked corner from like 3 tons of books falling on it on a subway platform. if i had any idea that the entire screen would be spider veined from sliding off the front of my sofa onto carpet, there's no way i'd have bought this. i'm not a fan of the curved edges at all and wish they had a flat version because i really do like samsung products for the most part. this one, however, is just a dud. it's way too fragile (and repairs way too expensive) to be useful to everyday folks. i've gone back to my old phone for now because i can't afford to pay to have it fixed in a repair shop and even the $200 deductible on the insurance policy just isn't worth it for a device that will likely break again if falling 2 ft onto carpet is enough to send it to the er.
just as expected, fast shipping too.
delivered on time this phone is amazing
it arrived before the intended date. i love my new cell phone.
simply amazing.. in love with the product and the customer service !!!
fast shipping, and it is as described.
great phone
i got this phone to because iphone 7 plus unlocked had gotten slow after ios 11. this phone is nice but i use at&t and i just found out that when at&t checks your phone on the network they disable wifi calling and edge calling. i found out when my phone started dropping calls at the office about a month and a half after buying it. i didn't see anything about this issue when i bought the phone and now it's too late to return the phone. one more reason to leave at&t!!! bad job amazon!!!
awesome phone.
so far so good. was everything they said.
much better than my refurbished note 4.
have a good application
great phone!
good phone. nice camera and the screen is good. i hate the wrap-around screen, though. does nothing for me as a feature, and it makes it hard to get an effective case. my screen protector doesn't work well with the case, either. definitely going to get something with a flat screen next time i get a phone. sad, too, because i've really liked my samsung phones, otherwise. really like the alarm app.
was wrapped excellently and everything same so neat
phone malfunctioned in less than 6 months.
love it. way better than a iphone. and cheaper too
perfect
very good. still checking out
amazing phone i love it
upgrade from ip6 to ss8 plus now. very incredible production. it works with gsm carrier. fast shipping and good customer service. 5 stars!
overall ok, but after several techs could not get it to send any texts i had to returned it.
i got this phone in august and it already has screen burn in! i use my phone like an average user. wtf?!
initially, loved the phone and user-friendly set-up. sleek design and great photo and sound quality. however, i don't know what happened, but the phone just died on me abruptly. never submerged it in water, besides light dampening from getting caught in the rain, moisture that other samsung phones that i have owned that do not claim to have any water-resistance withstood. had a top of the line phone case from day 1 with no hard falls within last 1-2 months. bought this phone new, however, it is not covered by any warranty as i am not in the usa. very disappointed...buyer beware!
awesome phone but if it gets dropped in just the wrong spot, part of the screen will crack.
after less then a week the whole back is cracked from dropping it two feet.. why would they make a phone made entirely of glass??????
huned👊👊👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿
excelent
unlocked s8 will not fully work on att / verizon.  these features are blocked:  hd voice, video calling, volte, and wifi calling features
it's awesome
just an average phone. the selling point being that it's an ""edge"" is kinda pointless being that most cases cover up around the edges. gets in the way of some video formats, covering the bar. and the screen protector helps but because of the ""edge"" it leaves the sides exposed. now the case will cover it as i said, however it will also slowly peel the screen protector off. and believe me you are gonna need that case. all the protection you can get. had a foot drop, not only do i have a cracked screen but an actual hole. waterproof selling point out the window. with such a high maintenance phone, idk why you would have it near water in the first place. had this for a few weeks, battery was great until recently,  drains more quickly now. damn ridiculous. (update: beside battery continues to diminish it total life span, now having trouble shooting and storing photos. they become corrupted) i'm done with this phone, should of given lg a chance.
recieved all accesories except the actual phone itself. extremely furiated. requested replacement and hopefully an issue with amazon and not samsung...
its ok
they sold it as us version but i receive as international unlock version(uae) - not  us warranty covered.they even gave false information to the amazon agent when she asked for a production origin.
i have been using samsung phones for 10 yrs.they have made advancements with the s8+, which i truly enjoy however there are too many draw backs for me.the bixby feature is awesome, it took a while to really get use out of bixby for me. you really have to use it in order for it to learn and be useful. i recommend setting it up and going through the prompts, play with it for an hour or two. set up short cuts. i found that ""take me home"" phrase i used when asking the previous assistant galaxy to navigate home, does not work on bixby unless you set up a short cut. i do not however like the button. i find myself accidentally hitting the button all the time which disrupts what i'm doing on my phone because then you must wait for the bixby home page to load before you may close out.two major complaints:the battery. i was blown away by the battery life when i first got my s8+! i've read a lot about battery preservation so i do not charge my phone while i'm sleeping because leaving it on the charger when it's fully charged kills the battery longevity. so i charge a couple hours a day while i'm at work and that's it. i stream music in the car so i expected that to drain the battery quickly but it did not! after exactly 6 months of use, my phone now loses about 30/40% just sitting idle while i don't use it in just about 3 hours. when i noticed this draining battery issue i immediately took action. i deleted every app that i don't use on a weekly basis. i set up the power saving mode. i changed screen settings. it has helped a little bit but not enough to really make a difference. i now have to charge my phone constantly.because of the very iphone-esk style they took begining with the s7, the phone now has a glass back that is not removable. making the purchase of a new battery to fix said problem impossible. i've always liked samsungs products..but this was a poor decision for their consumers.the screen. while the screen is beautiful and ""unboxed""...it is 10x more fragile than any other samsung or galaxy i have owned. i cracked my screen within two weeks of ourchase. i was and still am, unable to find a tempered glass screen protector with a fully adhesive screen (because of the new design with the edge). i have sworn by tempered glass screen protectors in the past, they have saved me so many times. i was also unable to find one for the s7 as well. i did purchase one that only adhered on the edges, which did exactly what i thought it would.  it slid off the couch onto carpet and the screen popped right off the phone. which for the record does nothing to absorb shock and prevent damage. i have the otterbox symmetry case on my phone and it still cracked when dropped. right on the stupid edge of the screen where it curves. then a few months later, it slides off a shelf in the restroom and lands on tile flooring. shatters again. i have shattered 3 out of the 4 corners on my screen all while in a case. i'd hate to see what happens when it's not in a case.overall i am disappointed with this new screen, while it is beautiful and excellent for my photography hobby...it just isn't durable or practical. while the new technology advancements android has made are excellent, i absolutely hate the quality of the phone. it's literally an $800 glass box around a computer.
the phone is fine. exactly what samsung says it is. here's what makes it awful. carriers will not offer coverage for full service area to an unlocked phone not purchased through them. the charges for service are the same, but the service area is limited, making an independent purchase a bad decision. carriers say it is a chip issue. that's a lie. it is a very easy thing to provide complete coverage for all customers regardless of their phones.
pulled out of package. followed instructions to the letter. all i got was the below. i watched every youtube video i could find about this problem and couldn't find anything helpful. the phone is a lemon. reset phone. charged for 1.5 hours. reset again and again. do not recommend.
beautiful phone. the best part is the aesthetic design. it's pretty fast until you use it for a couple months...then it starts to freeze, instagram works like crap on android, literally crap. crashes every day at least a couple times. they have so much to work on honestly...my next phone will be an iphone no doubt.
 the video is a three (3.5) month review review of the samsung galaxy s8 plus smartphone. we take a look at the design, screen, touch wiz, os, camera, video and audio playback and more. i've been using this as my daily driver and did my best to share my experience.the short version, if you don't want to watch the entire video - love it. one of the best looking phones out there with an awesome screen, camera, and overall performance. plus it's water resistant and has tons of features.
i've only had this phone for 5 months and the charging port doesn't work half the time and the battery dies in hours.
2 months and fail, problems with the motherboard. services here in uruguay told me that the phone is irreparable.
device arrived in great condition and all was set up perfectly.
no issues so far
good chance you break the screen even with a case on.
my phone stop working i would like to know what to do
screen shattered within 4 months of purchase
works with verizon and at&t.. tried both sim cards. no issues. more than likely will work with international sim cards. upgraded from pixel xl plus.
i don't normally write review but im abit disappointed that i feel like im getting an open box item while i purchased the new condition item. there is no plastic wrap around the phone, it does look used; the package didn't deliver on time and there is no bubble bag to protect the item during delivery. anyway, after i finish setup everything on the phone; i pulled out the headphone that comes with it to test - the volume adjustment is messed up. it doesn't work correctly. the lower button didn't work at all. i would have return this item if i didn't spend 3 - 4 hours setting up and messing around with it. i paid the full price and expecting a brand new phone.
not charging
fingerprint reader is not that big of an issue people, its an amazing phone stop reading useless reviews and get it.
battery life is very short. will be returning to the manufacturer.
th h
as per your instructions: i returned galaxy s8 on 2/27/2018 your label # 420569089304420502100016205514 thru usps. shouldn't you have received the item by now ?  thank you.
i was at the cinema, it fell from a 2ft height and the screen is shattered
nice
fairly certain this phone was opened before reaching me. there was no film on it, ear buds were missing, sim card release pin was missing, and phone was completely dead. it seems like a new phone so i'm sticking with it, but it i think someone took it out of the box, and used it for a time. it explains all of those things. especially the pin, which should be in a box with the documentation. all the reading material as there, the sheet with the pin on it was missing.
going from the iphone 6s to this phone. overall  l ike everything about this phone other than the camera. the camera is just slightly better the the 6s.
hello i bought the samsung galaxy but when the phone detects moisture it doesn’t charge the battery. how can i fix it?
are you on ios and wondering how difficult jumping ship to the android flagship phones would be?  well, that is exactly what i did and here is my experience.i'm starting with my conclusion because this is long: i love the hardware aspect of the galaxy s8+ with very few exceptions. it's a beautiful phone. after a couple of weeks i have my phone useable with fairly similar apps and functions i used on iphone. i like quite a bit of the additional functionality and customization offered. however, using the phone is like having every developer trying to turn the phone into a personal billboard trying to sell me something unless i'm willing to shell out $2 to $3 per app in most cases. to gain some of the higher end customization without ads can cost $5 or more in many cases.  it is quite a bit less efficient in every day use due to lack of streamlined integration between apps and additional ads.about mei have pretty much used ios for all my smartphone and tablet needs for about 8 years (or whenever iphone 3gs came out - i'm 99% sure it was before 2010).  i tested an android tablet for about 5 years ago and i was not impressed with the weight of the device nor the android apps so i stayed with ios.  i'm pretty sure after that experience is when i purchased my first ipad.  about a month ago i had a water incident with my iphone 6 plus and had to decide what phone to upgrade to.my motivation is because there are so many exciting phones in the near future, the samsung reviews are extremely positive, and the samsung s8+ is so much cheaper than the iphone 7+ after just months of being on the market (and i don't think this trend will change anytime soon). i jumped ship from ios so i could make a better decision about the next iphone before its release (iphone 8+ or whatever they name it).  i've used the samsung galaxy plus phone exclusively for about 3 weeks. here is what i struggled with, my suggestions for non-android users, what i've learned about android ecosystem, the pros and cons post switching, and what i will likely choose next.phone designbig pro - this phone design makes people drool. it looks great and it feel great in the hand - especially when you compare the plus size versions.  i could have gone with the plain size of this phone and been absolutely happy. my eyesight isn't that great so the larger screen is great.pro - the size of the phone is great in the hand.  the smaller one is even better. it feels better than iphone plus in the pocket, however the height is about the same so short pockets still cause issues.pro - build quality seems top of the line. buttons work great, etc.pro - i like the color options better than other phones out there.meh - expected to be a fingerprint magnet - and it is. lolcon - the hard to reach finger scanner on back - i type the unlock code often due to placement.con - dedicated bixby button - this button is just in the way; its placement causes accidental bixby engagement all the time and samsung has locked users out of reassigning the button.performance/batterypro/meh - in terms of speed the os (android nougat i believe) on this device has come quite a long way. overall i found the os response almost on par with ios.  i understand the difference between open architecture and apple's closed architecture, so this is a great achievement but it doesn't outperform ios in my use so i can't mark it as a clear pro. it felt capable in every way. it didn't glitch in a way that i didn't find acceptable but ios still wins here.pro - the ability to change performance modes is nice for increasing battery life or performance. i don't play any high performance games, but the gaming folder options to set the phone as a priority for gaming (no interruptions and high performance) may be the reason for some users to choose this over iphone.pro - quick charging and wireless charging are nice to have available (although i dont have those set up in my house).meh - with the customization of this phone, it is easy to affect battery life without realizing it. in real day to day useage, i don't have all my charging stations set up for this phones usb c connector - i have iphone chargers set up in many rooms of my house out of necessity. with most of the usb chargers i have, i dont feel this phone charges much faster than my iphone. in my experience so far the phone underestimates how long it will take to get to a full charge by quite a bit maybe 20 or 30 percent. the good part is that i don't think it will be any worse than using my iphone - but i'm not charging this thing any less either.durabilitybig pro - waterproof. since my last phone died due water and i was always putting my phone in a ziplock bag to run when weather was questionable or out at the lake, this is something i am glad to have.meh - screen glass is marketed to be pretty scratchproof. i've ordered a screen protector and i tried to keep the film on the glass while waiting for it to arrive, but the film didnt stay adhered but 4 days or so.  i've been careful and only carry the phone in my pocket by itself and i have a scratch. i've never scratched a phones screen this quickly but there are so many factors that i won't list it as a con.meh - i cant speak to back durability personally since i was able to find protector quickly and have not dropped the phone. but videos online show that the back can crack if dropped on concrete from only 3 feet which is about waist height. although other drop tests show it surviving drops from 5 feet, most crack the backglass at this height. drop tests online seem to indicate decent front durability often surviving a 5 foot drop. from what i've researched, the front seems as durable as (if not a bit more than) an iphone and the back really dictates a cover.screenpro - the screen resolution is great. i do like the screen, but in use at mid arms length away i can't tell much difference with the resolution at max or the mid setting. i appreciate the ability to run mine at the mid setting to save battery life.big pro - i stream movies on my phone often and getting a larger video with a more narrow phone is a great experience.pro - the curved glass is just sexy on electronics. the screens edge does a great job of ignoring touches when holding the phone. that edge is visible when the phone is face down so it can be set for notifications and i've seen the ability to run a stock ticker down it.pro - always on display with very little battery impact. i didn't realize how often i turn on my phone just to see the time or even date. once this is set to disply the things you are 'just checking,' you will save some battery life.con - the screen seems very dim in comparison to iphone. it is capable of a comfortable brightness, but when maxed out i feel like i'm using a reduced setting from my iphone.camerapro - that damn camera bump is gone!!! this phone will sit flat on the table - nuff said if you are using an iphone.pro - the cameras (hardware) on this phone are best in class.  i give this phone the edge because in low light, it captures more light than any apple phone.  in bright light, it's a draw unless you truly have need of the 2 cameras on the iphone.  in my use, my cropped images come out great so a 2nd lens doesn't add the same value as low light performance.  my video needs are the same - i need more low light performance than ability to use a different lens.meh - i'm not labeling this a con on purpose.  i know there is a phone out there with 2 backfacing lenses. 2 lenses do not make me want that bump on the back of my phone.storagepro - you get a respectable 64 gig onboard and can add a card (whenever you need it) to increase it at a reasonable price using standard 3rd party memory cards.  none of that bulls**t apple gouging.ports/bluetoothpro - its accessories are all generic. it is so nice to buy an extra cable for $2. i know i can buy 3rd party apple cables but some fit well and some are so tight you may damage the phone. i love not having to deal with that - although switching all my phone docks and cables did cost a few bucks. if the next iphone switches its port, i wouldn't be able to use them anyway.pro - the earphone jack. i am no audiophile and have gone wireless for audio in most ways. but by design, my car connects phones to the radio with an audio cable. this phone requires nothing new to use that. its an added plus when i forget to charge my wireless headphones.con - the usb c connection just doesn't feel as tight to me.  when i connect the cable it doesnt align straight as easily as the lightning connector - even with using the cables provided with phone. also, i get errors from different chargers that the phone is not connected completely. i think the error is because the phone is expecting a fast charger, but it has me a little concerned about reliability in the back of my mind.authentication/securitypro - eyescanner is great for unlocking phone. i've had better restults than many reviews. mine will usually scan me correctly from a reading position if i pull the phone up toward my face about 2 feet. even in dim light it usually reads which greatly reduces this next con.con - i am sooo used to the fingerscanner, it is an unatural action to unlock anything on this phone. the placement is not where i can reach it naturally so i have to shift the phone to scan and it has gotten to be a real pain in the ass when i unlock apps.con - eyescanner either does not work to unlock apps (like paypal, etc) or it isn't coded in a way to easily connect it. it seem to only unlock phone.con - did i mention logging into apps is a pain in the ass on this phone? dashlane is an app that makes this a bit more bearable but once you know how easy it is on apple it is hardly comparable replacment. if you use financial apps, you will dedicate some time to trying to get around this. i think on the standard phone the fingerprint scanner felt more accessible so this may be an issue specific to the plus model.meh - facescanner is available but a photo can unlock the phone. as easily hacked as this is, i don't see the point of using this. maybe if i wanted to lock a younger child out of my phone. anyone over the age of 8 that wants to get into your phone will get past this lock.meh - i generally don't feel as secure with my data in the apps, os, and features of this phone and the android infrastructure. many find this a pro since you can choose all these different apps to help. it is the same feeling when i use my windows computer, security is all on my shoulders and i better address it someway. and all the free solutions have ads. apple has a great track record with securing data, privacy, etc. everything i read about setting up android points you to security features to enable. am i protected? i've installed some suggested apps, but who the hell knows.customizationpro - out of the box, this phone is one of the most highly customizable phones available to change your experience to how you want the phone to look and behave. you can add and remove features of the os (like the app drawer which iphone users do not have), edit how app icon looks, rename or remove app names, etc. some customizations are pretty sweet - like backgrounds can move with movement of the phone and the camera can be used to sync the background with whatever colors the camera is capturing.pro - the keyboard can be reduced in size and offset to the side of your prominent hand so that the keys are easy to reach with one hand. if the big con for word prediction didnt exist, this might be a reason to change phones when using plus size.meh - speech of os. it is good but apple does relistic speech better.con (if new to android) - it is overwhelming to use this phone out of the box without some grounding first. it may be licensing or userbase expectation, but there are dual applications for many functions. it is preinstalled with samsungs version of chat, email, and browser apps as well as the android standard equivilent. as you set these up and start using them, they'll be prompting back and forth to change defaults. some are similarly named and the functions between each have nothing dictating where the app settings will be located, how to engage the settings, etc. the os does not have any wizard guiding you through steps in an order that makes sense. apple sort of walks you through step by step of creating your apple account first, then security choices, etc. you get none of that here. you keep tinkering with creating accounts and settings until something works, then you move onto the next thing you want to work. it may take a week to get this phone to replace an iphone completely if you use many apps at all.big con - using the keyboard drives me close to insanity because of how often the wrong word appears. it is functional (i've defaulted to using gboard after some comparing of 3rd party) but it takes about twice the effort as iphone. if i hadn't used iphone i likely wouldn't notice but i have used one and i notice this fault - every time i have to type an email or text message.con - i have some loss in trust in settings to take and work as expected. i've had this phone ring at work when i thought i had do not disturb set. i do not know why the setting changed and it was easy enough to address, but you must click and look for check marks, okays, enable, save buttons that iphone never requires you to click.  there is no standard across the platform so unless you exit and go back into a setting, i never know it took.big con (for my use) - enabling handicap features can be painful. on iphone, i can set my phone up to triple tap to enable text to speech so the os will read aloud to me. i use this very often to have kindle books read to me without having to rely on audible or paying for whispersync books. enabling this on android is very difficult and it will not continue to read past a paragraph max. if someone has figured this out, please respond with comment.big big big con - ads, ads, everywhere. do you like having your phone boot into a screen with a big ad displayed in the middle of it? well android provides that functionality - in fact every developer over uses it in a way iphone users do not experience. once you customize and get some crazy ad resulting, you'll need an app to find what is causing it. in fact, i almost returned this phone on day 2 because of an ad. and i got some good advice i'm passing along to you if you keep reading.functionspro - best 3d experience available on a phone. for under $10 you can get a 3d headset for your phone and be immersed in some pretty awsome videos. yes, iphone does this too, but samsung does it better. what i did not know is that the experience is 360 degrees. you'll need to stand up to turn around and see what is behind you, but when you are flying in that jet, you can see the pilot if you turn around. i watched a cartoon with aliens in front of me and rabbit hiding behind me and i missed half of the action because i kept trying to check what the rabbit was doing. this is not something i need to have in anyway, but it is fun and costs very little to get set up. be forewarned, you will be seasick after your first use and riding a rollercoaster standing up in 3d can make you fall down.pro - audio over wireless just sounds better to me compared to iphone 6. i don't know about other versions but with same headsets i get more bass, etc.meh - phone calls are okay but i'm not impressed with the app. it is harder to use and integration between apps is not all that great. here are some of the items harder than iphone - answering a call, finding and calling a contact, setting up a 3way call, adding a new call into a current call (still haven't gotten it to happen), selecting a phone number in another app and having phone app open and call.meh - bixby is samsungs response to siri (and google assistant which is on this phone also).  in concept bixby should develop into something more useful than siri for chaining commands together (set this setting and opne this app, or open this app and do this), but it is not fully realized yet. having to hold the button for the duration of the command comes difficult to me and it feels unnecessary and i just don't like it. and i don't like that button anyway. engaging google assistant is the same as siri and i like that way of turning it on better. i've used siri more so i know what to expect and i know what it does. i have less favorable results with both of these but bixby was only recently enabled. i think it may develop into something pretty nice to use if samsung will rethink that button and the requirement to hold it for the duration of the command. and honestly about half the time i've clicked on the bixby button, i was trying to hold my phone or adjust my volume - bad placment.con - one better like clicking okay and yes to use these apps. android suffers from the same thing windows does. you have to click an extra time or 2 to get a function to set. even when logging in right now, i may have to push the home button, then swipe up, enter a code, and then click an ok to proceed. on my iphone, i pushed the home button and let my finger rest there and i was in. the majority of system settings and apps have similar unneccessary extra selections and swipes.con - speech to text in voice assistants, text message or email is truly unpredictable. i did not truly appreciate how well apple does this until i stopped using it on this phone. it is really that bad in most real life situations that i want to use it.big con - there is an emergency call button (it will dial 911 if you click it) that is badly placed on the unlock screen. i conciously have to avoid hitting that stupid thing 20 to 40 times a day. it's these things that seriously puts iphone ahead of samsung in actual usage.  i don't have issue with it there, but i need option to move it up on screen where i won't accidentally hit it. i cannot be the only person that hates this.big con - audio volume is ok for music apps but it has an annoying warning about excessive volumes damaging hearing that i want to disable forever and it won't let me. i wouldn't mind seeing the warning and have it go away in a couple of seconds, but you must interact with the warning manually. it is especially irritating because of this next big con.con - audio in apps are extremely low when using cabled headsets and at least some on wireless. one example is podcast apps. i have to max out the phone volume and increase my car stereo volume to hear them at the same volume of songs. i use a jabra headset when driving in my car - it's what i used to use with my iphone and the same issue is present with it. i don't know how many apps are affected, and it may be setting related, but it is an issue out of the box.con - videos do not go full screen by flipping screen sideways. in almost every instance iphone does this by default. it is not the case here - ofen it takes a click or 2 to get that to take.appspro - multiple app stores to download products.pro - because android allows more access to hardware and os, there are apps for a whole different use than what apple apps provide. there are many apps to add functionality to the phone. the phone can go into silent mode or reduce its volume anytime you arrive at work for example. you can change your icons from developer default to marbles with the app name listed on them.meh - apps are mostly as functional as what ios equivilent provides, but they aren't streamlined for ease of use. i miss my iphone apps quite a bit.con - most underground app stores likely have viruses in part of their offered apps.con - most free apps have ads.big con - unless you are willing to download apps from 'risky' locations, apps without ads are double or triple the price on apple. i rarely see any paid for app include an ad but i see many paid for apps include apps after purchase.untestedna - provided headphones. they are marketed to be $100 street value but i use wireless audio and haven't had the need to test yet.and here are my suggestions for those not used to android:don't do as i did. as soon as i got basics down (before i sorted out what i needed to work), i hit the store and got lost in downloading free apps. before i knew it i had a bunch of apps i didn't remember the function for and i included a launcher that sounded soooo great.  and then i figured out what came with those downloads - apps. i was unhappy for a day with an app on my home screen. it was from the launcher by the way. the launcher made me about half crazy trying to work against it. so, if you are stuck in this mode, uninstall, uninstall, uninstall. airpush detector is an app that can help identify sources of ads.stay with samsung's default touchwiz launcher at first.  a launcher gives you a look and feel to the device and determines what functions you can add and remove from the settings.  when new to android, touchwiz gives plenty to play with and see what is available and you don't get embedded ads up front.put the settings app somewhere you can find it easily.by default, the touchwiz launcher gives you a main landing screen that has a google search field and the primary row of phone related apps you see on every screen and one seconadary row of icons that belongs to this landing screen only. when you scroll to the right, the primary row will go with the view and the secondary will go offscreen with the rest of that landing screen. the idea is that the apps on the secondary row are your most frequently used apps along with the main phone apps on the primary row. when you scroll to the screen to the right, that screen is similar to what iphone screens look like - a grid for placing apps over a chosen background. each time you scroll to the right you can add one of these grid screens as iphone does. something not found on iphone is an app drawer. it is available from each screen, if you swipe upward on the primary row - there is an up arrow on the primary row indicating the app drawer and you can choose to keep or remove a dedicated button that opens it as well. that drawer has a default copy of every app installed on the phone. if you want one on any of the main screens, press and hold an app inside the app drawer and it will let you pull it upward out of the drawer and it will drop to whatever location you release it at. the copy will remain in the drawer unless you explicitely delete or hide it from there.if you already know you don't like the app drawer concept, you can remove it and the upward screen swipe function will go away and all installed apps will drop onto the those grid screens - just like how iphone behaves. if you are getting lost looking for apps, go ahead and remove the app drawer now to get closer to the iphone default setup: settings app icon > display > home screen > home screen layout.  i suggest adding it back at a later date to see if you like it later; once there isn't so much to get used to at once.you likely are used to having a set of apps on the main row of your homescreen from whatever smart phone you come from. change the row of apps on the primary row to match what you currently use and set those apps up for use.the timeout to black out the screen is way too fast when one is trying to figure out how to configure the phone. go to settings and change setting not to lock if looking at screen.  bixby can help find - just hold the button and ask to change that setting. if you have no samsung account, you get to set up your account now.the phone is likely completely unlocked to anyone - you should set up security at some point - i suggest setting the passcode, the fingerprint scanner & the iris scanner. you'll be unlocking the phone once you do this, so decide if you want to do this now or later.the phone comes with 2 app stores installed, they are samsung market and google playstore.  i do not group my apps by developer. i group them by what they do. i suggest you pull the apps out of any folders they are in and put the near each other.  i usually look in the samsung marker first to see if there is a version of an app developed specifically for this phone and if not, i look in google playstore which will be developed for android phones in general.next get some sort of security on the phone. most carriers will have some sort of security app pre-installed. launch it and make sure it is set up. i also installed avast from one of the app store due to its popularity across android forums.if you are like me, you now have lots of apps running in the background. press the dedicated recent softkey next to the home button. it is indicated by 2 arrows making a box. you can close them all.initially, i was getting confused by apps provided to do same thing. select an app for each function and remove the other app.messaging clients: i hid messages (it wont uninstall) & stayed with message+ until i could navigate the os easily.browsers: this is a difficult choice. samsung internet(purple globe) is designed to be integrated with this phones hardware and shows to be most similar to iphone's browser for efficiency.  in my usage, it blocked sites that chrome didn't and that i didn't feel were unsafe.  if you have no preference and gmail isn't your default form of communicating, i'd disable chrome (no uninstall available) unless you have same issue i had. if you are tied to gmail, i'd use chrome and hide/uninstall internet if it'll let you.if you were using an iphone before, samsung has provided an app called smart switch to hook to your iphone with provided hardware in the box (the one with the usb hookup adapter) and it will scan your iphone and set up your contacts, move your photos if you have room, and find matching apps from the stores.  i'd run that at this time.now go find a free background or theme you like in one of the stores.select what displays on your always on display.set up your apps and you should be set to use the phone for a bit.once you are comfortable using all that you have set up - maybe a day or 2, set up the edge app. you'll have a better idea by that time what might be nice to have on that shortcut.other suggestions:set do not disturb on a schedule (in the settings app) if you get woken up by text messages and such at night.block blue light with sunset (in the settings app) - supposedly reduces affects of phone screen on your sleep.set finger scanner to swipe down to pull notifications open - honestly i dont use it, but go ahead - it's kind of cool.note:you cannot delete apps that are sitting on the primary apps bar - you must relocate it to the grid. depending on app, it may not allow uninstall, but you may be able to disable and/or hide.  worst case, make a folder and hide all unused apps in it.after a few days, research what a widget is and set one up on one of your screens - maybe a calendar or a clock.after a few more days, research what ""edge"" apps are available to you.some apps that i'm using:ad source finder- air push detector (suggested by coworker)downloaded & changed keyboard to gboard (suggested by forums and tested well against others i tried)ad blocker - crystal ad blocker (can't remember why i chose this)pw manager - dashlane shows up top in many reviews (you have to engage the app to set up the pw)browser - puffin pro (free has ads) for speed of use - but it has a drawback of memory consumption compared to other browserschat client - textra (mainly testing from high reviews)widget - i'm using a widget called month to put a calendar on one of my grid screens.
phone works great but having problems with the sim card. says the carrier is sprint but i cant use textnow (who is a branch of sprint.) only buy if youre in for some carrier problems.
great phone, screw bixby.
i don't know what kind of operating system this was suppose to be but it was not legit or anything else samsung makes. i have an s8 and was buying one for my husband so i knew exactly what it was suppose to look like. it was much larger than my phone so i checked the model number and it was for an s8+. the only good thing about this transaction was my prompt refund.
cherry
it dope,it really different
very disappointing battery life just like my old galaxy s5. why can't samsung make the charger port micro usb like everyone else on the planet (except crapple, of course)? at least they do provide an adapter with the phone which is easily lost. sin cards are not backwards compatible with old galaxy s models which cost me an extra $25 for a new sim card to make this phone operational.
not headphones arrived, what happen??
black screen on arrival. black screen. charge works, the ""accessibility"" voice talks. but no screen at all. so disappointed!
on time and as described.  samsung galaxy.  enough said...
i received an empty box .. i demand my money back
i am a long time galaxy user.  my whole family and i have had samsung galaxies since the s3.  but this s8 annoys me to no end.  they are turning the galaxy into an iphone.  if i wanted form over function, silly proprietary annoyances just for the sake of an advertising image -- well, i would have bought an iphone.  but i didn't.battery:  i have had this s8 for 9 weeks now.  i cannot make it through the day without the phone dying.  that's bad enough.  but far, far worse is the fact that the battery cannot be changed. lack of interchangeable batteries has long been the achilles heel of iphones.  iphone users constantly complain about it.  so what does samsung do?  make a new model with a sealed, non-changeable battery.  so i guess we're supposed to just throw our $750 phone away once the battery goes bad. if all the other galaxies has interchangeable batteries, and all us users loved it, why would you even consider removing that much-loved feature?  and don't tell me for waterproofing.  i don't care.  you should be able to figure that out.all-glass case:  are you kidding me?  if you look at the phone wrong, it will break.  and it's unbelievably slippery.  nice combination -- slippery, made of breakable glass, front and back.  people are breaking their phones between the time they get it at the t-mobile store and the time amazon prime can deliver a protective case. and even with a case, it'll break. i mean come on, the whole thing is made of glass.  of course it's going to break.proprietary charging port:  the galaxy s5 had a usb 3.0.  that was genius, seriously.  the s5 was universally compatible -- including backwards compatible with usb 2.0, which means practically every charging cable in the world could be used to charge it.  in addition, usb 3.0 is super fast for data transfers.  so, what does samsung do?  create a new, proprietary cable connection that doesn't exist anywhere else on any piece of technology ever invented.  what a great idea -- let's turn the best charging system into the worst.  and that's even worse than apple.  iphones are known for their unusable proprietary features, but at least there are lots of different iphones that use their proprietary cable.  in this case, only the s8 uses this useless connection.infinity display:  samsung touts the ""uninterrupted surface that flows seamlessly over the edges"".  okay, one question.  did anyone actually hold this phone in their hand before bringing it to market?  because if they had, they would know that your hand cannot hold the phone without touching the ""seamless edges."" obviously.  so, various parts of your hand are constantly interfering with the function of the phone. so, just holding the phone, my hand is constantly fighting with my fingers for control of the phone.  i'd like to know -- who was asking for their phone to be turned into an infinity pool?  in case someone from samsung is reading this, let me answer the rhetorical question: no one.  no one cares that their phone wraps around the edge if it interferes with the operation of the phone.in other words -- form over function.  give me a phone that works well over some gimmicky new change that no one cares about anyway.  stop copying apple, and bring back a real samsung galaxy.
piece of junk!  have to shut phone off to get notifications.  not good for my business.
my boyfriend j, loves his new phone, its a phone he likes he said after using it for some hours.
buy a case!!! if you read the bad reviews they all hate the phone because they said it is slippery and fragile!! my only advise is to buy a $20 case and the protection plan! totally worth it! i bought mine a month ago and it is the best piece of technology i have ever owned. i am a huge samsung fan and this is by far my favorite and has not disappointed me yet. this phone is amazing. it definitely beats out its apple competitors and if you do not believe me then do your research because this phone is unprecedented. i love it and it is worth every last penny! it will last for years to come and it is built to resist shatters and drops and it is even water resistant for up to 30 minutes under 5 feet of water!!! it is smooth to the touch and is extremely fast!! the memory usage is fantastic and the features it comes with are great. i recommend this to anyone buying a new phone...it is everything seen in the commercials and more. it has bixby on it and she can do anything... i often use her feature to remind me where i parked or turn the lights off!!! amazing technology and great phone!!!
actually loved the phone but ""hate"" samsung customer support.before you buy, do a quick search for ""samsung galaxy 8 usb port moisture detected"".  you'll find hundreds of listings.the closest my samsung had ever been to water was sitting in the kitchen (and beyond that, supposedly the phone is water resistant).the usb port moisture detected warning pops up continuously and prevents the phone from being charged via the usb port unless you turn it off, turn it back on, insert the plug when then samsung name comes on.  samsung referred me to an authorized center who told me that it's a known problem with the software and that it'll be fixed in an upcoming release.  so for the past month, i've been dealing with the constant issue.enough .......... got rid of it through the amazon trade in plan and ""upgraded"" to a new nokia 6.1.never another samsung product .for me ...... ever.
this is a great phone in terms of its power and ui... pretty much any phone in this price point is going to be amazing, and it definitely fits the bill in terms of specs and performance.however, it is probably the most fragile phone ever made.  i have never broken a phone in my life, and i drop my phone as much as the next person.  you can tell the second you hold this phone that it is amazingly fragile.  the whole thing is made of gorilla glass, which is known to spider crack extremely easily.  crazy that this design was actually approved, i don't care how strong you think your glass is it will never be more durable than metal/plastic.  any benefits are overshadowed by the fact this is the most fragile phone ever to hit the market.the design of the phone makes it way easier for it to slip out of your pocket.  i can't ever remember having my phone fall out of my pocket (i am sure it has happened, but nothing became of it ie breaks), but i had to constantly be aware of my phone in my pocket/take it out and put it on the table because when i sat it immediately started to slip out.  i think it is because this phone is larger vertically and smaller horizontally compared to most phones.  i have owned many phones, and this has never been a problem until the moment i put this phone in my pocket.my phone fell out of my pocket while sitting, it was a drop between 2 and 2.5 feet, and it cracked in 2 corners, one corner that was not even apart of the initial impact.  the fact a corner that had no major impact whatsoever (a fall of maybe 4 inches after the first corning hit the ground) cracked was alarming to say the least.  shame on me for not having the case on it (i literally had the phone for 3 hours, did not make it home yet and my case i purchased was at home)...  however, few weeks later it slipped out again, with a case on, and the whole front of the phone shattered.... again a drop no more than 2.5 feet.insurance on this phone is an absolutely must, or i guarantee you will not own this phone in a working fashion very long.  my s5 fell 2 stories and didn't get a scratch. this phone fell 2 feet and spider cracked to a point where i need to get it repaired.  one of the most important aspects of a cell phone is its durability and ability to handle everyday life and people where accidents happen at one point or another is guaranteed.  the fact you have to treat this phone with the delicacy of an infant makes it almost a burden to own.between the failings of the s7 and the beyond poor durability of the s8, this lifelong android user may switch to iphone my next phone purchase a few years down the line
package arrived today with the s8+ box and all (charger etc) but no phone. i am so disappointed. payed this much for just a box! think twice before buying or end up having a bad time. hoping for a replacement or at least a refund because i purchased a phone not just a box.
i have had this phone for about 5 months now. now i have owned the s4, note 4 and now the s8. samsung is notorious for lag after some months of use. as a previous samsung phone owner i took some steps to try and mitigate any lag as best i could. i install avg cleaner and consistently let it run to clean my device of any unnecessary junk. i reboot it at least once a week! i clear it's ram and delete any background memory hogs that might slow it down. despite this it has managed to lock up on me at least twice in the 5 months that i can remember and self reboot. there is still some latency but overall it has been pretty responsive. given the option to purchase it again now that i have had it for 5 months i can't say i would have made another choice. after 5 months it's still a solid phone and in my opinion one of the best phones available as of writing this review.  when i was looking for a new phone to buy 5 months ago i was seriously considering leaving the samsung line, i was fed up with their notorious lag and wanted something more stable. on the day i decided to buy the phone samsung had the best deal out. i am glad i waited a while and didn't buy it as soon as it hit the shelves. the price dropped and it came with two free gifts!verdict... great phone! not perfect!  but... just great!
long time iphone user that was moved to try the galaxy s8+ due to its large screen, beautiful design, and deep price discounts. unfortunately, i had to return the s8+ after just a week and a half because it was unable to maintain a band 12 t-mobile lte connection. t-mobile blamed samsung, samsung blamed t-mobile, so i just returned the thing. i went back to my iphone 7+ ready to put the whole s8+ experience down as a failed experiment. i originally ordered the s8+ from samsung's website. the user experience of the purchase and return, compared to apple, was crude and confusing. i had to call samsung order support and tech support multiple times, every interaction with samsung was awful. everything i was told by support was wrong and they never followed through with anything they said they would do.but here's the thing, as i went back to using my iphone 7+, ios just felt so... boring. and the iphone 7+ design, which i had previously liked, looked so... dated.now let's face it, android is a mess. duplicated functionality, inconsistent ux, and the android upgrade and update situation is pathetic. but android felt exciting! and boy do i miss that s8 screen and overall phone design.then there is this year's apple contenders. sure, apple hasn’t announced anything yet, but with all the leaks we pretty much know that two of the iphones will continue the tired 3-year old iphone 6 design, and the new amoled iphone with that ugly notch?have you seen the leaks of the galaxy note 8? what a stunner!i'll wait for apple to officially announce, but if the leaks and rumors end up being true - call me a glutton for punishment - i’m all over that galaxy note 8!update: 9/19/17 - now that the iphone x has been announced and the note 8 is available, i bought another s8+, and this one is functioning just fine. i don't like the iphone x's look (the notch), the price, and many of its new features aren’t things i would ever use. i didn' see enough bang for the additional bucks to choose the note 8 over the s8+.  with the galaxy s8+, i think i have the best looking phone on the market today at a reasonable price (got it on sale), even if i have to put up with android's goofiness.
i purchased my galaxy s8 from the samsung site only because they gave me $200 for my old phone (galaxy s5). i was hesitant at first, given some of the negative reviews here and also elsewhere on the web. i have now owned the phone for over a month, here are my impressions.1. red screen: this was one of my main concerns, since many people seem to have received phones with red screens. the phone does have a setting that is called ""blue light filter"", which i find awesome because it tends to protect your eyes from the damage these screens cause especially when used in the dark. with this setting turned on, the colors do tend to look reddish at first, but you quickly get used to it. otherwise, you can turn it off and the colors of the screen are simply amazing. so i had absolutely no issues here. the screen resolution and size are exceptional.2. fingerprint scanner: it's on the back of the phone, right next to the camera. at first, i'll admit it was a bit inconvenient, since i had some trouble putting my finger on the scanner rather than the camera. however, the minute i got a case for the phone, this stopped being an issue, since the case border is useful as a guide to put my finger in the right spot. at this point, the scanner is great, it easily recognizes the fingers i have registered and is many times better and faster than the one i had in my prior phone. i am 100% used to it now and even look for the scanner in the back whenever i hold a different phone. so again, no issues here, even if there are a ton of reviews saying that people can never ever get used to it. i actually like the location of the scanner now.3. size: i had a galaxy s5, which had a 5.1"" screen. this one has a 5.8"" screen and feels much better. the s8 feels long at first but the dimensions ""make sense"" and you quickly get used to it. there's even an advantage here: i normally carry my phone in my front pants pocket and since the s8 a bit longer i can grab it more easily than i did the s5. i have found the s8 much more comfortable than the s8+ both to carry and to hold, and i haven't missed the extra half inch that the s8+ has.4. hardware and performance: this is a top-of-the-line phone and i have had absolutely no issues with lag, freezing, quality, or anything i can think of. videos look amazing, the camera and the camera software are quite more advanced than i am as a user, the sound from the speaker is missing nothing, and the sensors (iris, heartbeat, light, focus and so on) all work perfectly. the phone also comes standard with akg headphones and they are by far the best i've had, both in sound quality and in the materials used, i feel like they will last for a long time. i also had a problem at first with things like the edge bar getting in the way whenever i was playing a game, but it was a user error: the phone comes with game mode, which easily and quickly hides the edge bar while in a game, so it doesn't get in the way, and the minute you leave the game the edge bar is back on its own. i bought the phone in coral blue and the phone color is very attractive.5. some things i do not like (note: all these things are minor issues for me, that's why i gave the phone 5 stars):5a) sometimes i don't get notification sounds if, for example, i receive a message after several hours of not receiving one (in the mornings, for example). i just notice that the notification is there all of a sudden. i have tested this and it in fact happes with several apps. i'm sure this will have an easy fix with a software update, but for now i cannot trust notification sounds 100%. note: this is only true of the sound, the notifications do appear correctly all the time.5b) like i said before, the headphones are absolutely great. however, they have a quite sturdy and long cover for the jack, and using the phone in landscape mode with the headphones connected is a bit uncomfortable since the cover gets in the way quite a bit. this is inconvenient but by no means a huge issue.5c) bixby is still very limited, but the phone comes with google assistant, which i have found even better than siri at times. i would just prefer that the physical bixby button could be configured to use with google assistant. it's also a minor issue, since i can always press and hold the home button and get google assistant just as easily.5d) there are some web pages where, if you're watching a video in landscape mode and then turn to portrait, the video will not resize. this can be solved by hitting the back button but it's inconvenient. note: i found that this is true also for the iphone 8 that my buddy has. also note: this happens only in *some* pages, most of them work fine.5e) i was surprised at first to learn that there were no tempered glass screen protectors at the samsung store for this phone. then it made more sense, since the screen shape does not allow for a good protector. i have bought a couple of relatively inexpensive ones but they don't quite fit the phone or get loose very quickly. i would recommend that you save your money and don't buy any of those off-brand screen protectors for this phone, they won't work. i would prefer to have a screen protector for this phone but i can't have one, unless it's the plastic one samsung sells.6. in summary: the phone has an extremely attractive design and mine gets noticed quite a bit, so socially it's great. it's also an impressive piece of hardware, so when i'm alone i also enjoy it quite a bit. i have been told that my voice sounds clearer to the other person when i'm in a call since i have had this phone; i can also say that i can hear the other person much more clearly in this phone. the camera is outstanding, the sound and video quality are impressive, and the phone itself is very comfortable to use. also, i came from a galaxy s5 and the transfer of data and settings from that phone to the s8 was very quick and easy, and i was impressed at how much this felt like it was my own phone right from the beginning. i would definitely recommend this phone above any others in the market right now.
didn't work for me. i took this phone to too different metro pcs locations and they both said the same thing, no signal and activation won't go through.
this is a mostly good phone with lots of positives.  it has a great screen, good speakers for calls and playing music, and the touch interface is very responsive.  i even like the curved, edge-to-edge display. however, samsung seems to be emerging as the king of bloat and has loaded the phone with samsung's redundant software that adds zero value other than to make suman feel they are apple.  bixby is just terrible.  in fact, it was still in beta when the phone was released.  it offers nothing over google assistant or cortana and yet samsung added a dedicated button for it and one keeps getting promoted to set it up which i will not do again.  samsung pay is completely unnecessary.  the list goes on but samsung had a great phone going until the software team got involved and junked it up.
extremely fragile. after only 6 days of use it fell from my hand to the table (about 5 inches) and the screen cracked, part of the screen went green and stopped working. what about the ""gorilla glass""?? what kind of ""gorilla glass"" can't resist to a 5 inch fall? samsung has charged me 430 dollars (in brazil) to fix the damn thing.don't buy it!!
had the s7 edge and loved it. s8 plus? home button. or should i say lack of a home button. now it's on the screen and way to easy to touch.  once again in an attempt to make something great even better they screwed part of it up. the screen chips extremely easy, even with protector. got my s8 plus at best buy, they recomended the screen protector, installed it and said its bullet proof now. 1 drop from about 18 inches. screen protector shattered and fell off plus chipped the screen. best buys response. not our problem.  would be an excellent phone if not for the home button and extremely brittle screen.
after i got this phone, i used it less than 10 mins later the screen was froze and didn't response to any actions. i couldn't turn it off. the device keeps on for 4hrs (only thing good is the battery last long time?!) and was super hot the whole time. it finally shouted off after the battery runs out. this is my first purchase samsung product and very disappointed!! i don't understand why a new device stop working in the very first day!i contacted to samsung costumer service and it is horrible horrible horrible. i emailed them several times and never got responds (their website said they will reply within 24 hrs, never happened!!)
i bought at at&t store at a much higher price; that's a whole 'nuther story!  pros:  good camera, fast processor, sufficient memory, sharp display, that's it.  cons.  it should be said i prematurely retired my perfectly good samsung mega (pre-notes).  so this screen is way to small, small buttons, small type, small icons, small.  the wrap-around edge thing is bogus, just makes it hard to hold without a fat case.  speaking, tiny thin flimsy and fragile.  the aftermarket is rich with contact screen stick-on guards and robust cases just so you can hold it without accidentally calling russia, by accident.  don't buy this stuff in at&t store either. it'll cost 5x!  strange charging cord, all my old ones are obsolete.  new note isn't any better in size either; i liked my old phablet and they just can't be had any more.  you can still get the i-6s+ which comes close.  really miss my old phone.
i bought this s8 phone directly from samsung as they were having a big sale just before thanksgiving, plus they were giving $400 rebates on my old phone (a samsung s7 i purchased from verizon).  my old s7 was in great condition, but ... it was locked into verizon, and despite what their offices will tell you, it's difficult to buy a sim chip overseas to purchase service in order to avoid verizon's high cost international plans.  when the phone arrived, i put in a new 64mb memory chip, enabled wifi, logged into my gmail account, and almost immediately google started sending my apps to the new phone.  i spent an hour or two recreating my pages, and then the dreaded moment arrived - time to move the verizon sim from the old to the new, and either go online or call verizon to associate the new s8 with my old sim/phone number.  but ... amazingly, within 30 seconds of installing the sim, the s8 became fully operational and was using my phone number!  easy, peasy.  no logging into verizon, wading thru their customer svc dept - nada.  it just worked!  so, how do i like the new s8?  well, i could do without the curved glass, and don't like doing without the home button and the quick unlocking of the phone, but ... the battery life seems to be longer, although it's still a bit early.  am finding that if i'm going to be away from electrical power it's best to disable the biggest battery hog of all time - facebook.  it doesn't hurt to disable it, as it comes roaring back when you open it, but while in disabled mode it's not constantly polling the mother ship and drawing the battery down.  oh, and the camera seems to be a wash versus the s7.  at some point, and maybe we've reached it - smartphones will have a level of perfection which - for all practical purposes - can't be exceeded.  sorta like pc's.  about the only thing samsung and apple can do, imho, is to compete on the basis of price.  tis inevitable.  look at what's happened to the cost of laptops and desktops.
operating system:  if you’re a samsung user, or even if you’ve never owned a samsung in the past, i highly recommend the samsung galaxy s8+.  this phone is by far the fastest operating phone that samsung has ever made. this is the perfect phone for someone that spends a high amount of time on their phone and wants the speed of the phone to be able to keep up.  this phones operating system will not slow down for you, it will be able to handle anything you throw at it.user interface:  this phone also has very friendly user interface.  you can make it as easy as you want, and on the other hand you can make it very customization with very complex setting that many people enjoy to toy around with.battery life:  the battery life on this phones seems to be incredible compared to the other samsung’s in the past.  even with being on social media, snapchat, and the browsing the internet for several hours a day, you will usually end the day with above 50% battery life.  there are many settings that you can toy around with to make the battery better.  one thing you are able to shut off to improve your battery life is the “always on display”, this is a feature that always shows what time it is, which uses unnecessary battery life.water resistant:  this is a great feature to have on a phone.  you never phone when you will accidentally drop your phone in the toilet, river, or other wet places.  you will enjoy the water resistant feature of your phone when you are able to fetch it out before there is water damage done to your phone.fast charging:  you will want to get this phone with the fast charger if possible.  everyone hates waiting for their phone to charge, when you really need to use.  with this charger your phone will be charged in no time.bixby:  the bixby button on this phone is a feature where you tell it commands and it’s supposed to perform whatever task you tell it to do within the phone.  this is a nice feature for when you would be driving or really anything that needs to be hand free.  the one negative thing about this is that the button for it is directly below the volume buttons, so it often gets bumped on accident and goes off.
will not support wifi calling (or other advanced calling features) on verizon.  i was able to install the verizon sim and get the phone working without problems but features are missing, with wifi calling being a big one. verizon says they are aware of this with samsung s8 unlocked phones and there is nothing they can do as all features are enabled on their end.  samsung has not responded to my queries so they don't get any points for customer service.other things to be aware of: it really is slippery so you need a case, but be aware that the case really won't protect the phone screen because it will be designed not to cover the infinity edges.  it really is too big for your pockets.  cut a piece of foam board the size of the device and carry it around with you for a few days.other than the missing features, this phone seems to work fine.  i would not buy it again but if you must, get one from your communications carrier, not an unlocked version.
i just replaced the galaxy s5 with a galaxy s8.  the screen is beautiful, camera takes amazing photos, better battery performance, and improved signal strength.  however i think the texting feature has taken a step back overall but worst of all, the voice-to-text feature is atrociously poor, constantly misspelling words (like 'clubutt' instead of columbus), despite repeated attempts of speaking slowly and clearly. also when texting the auto-suggestion and auto-correction feature routinely provides incorrect options.
absolutely the worse phone i have ever owned. battery life is sub standard. purchased a screen cover, but the phone has a mind of its own, and the rounded edges make it next to useless to type or navigate, even when the screen is super clean. the phone looks large, but keyboards and apps appear small, and hard to use, due to the curvature of the screen, and the bixby program that cannot be removed? is the most irritating application known to mankind. i will not be fooled again, never another samsung product.
i'm rating 5 stars to counteract the carrier shills who tell you not to buy this phone. they are wrong. anybody who tells you not to buy this because of ""updates"" is a fool. the unlocked phone is literally the best version, because it works everywhere, and you will never be stuck on a carrier with it. you pick this phone, and you can use whichever carrier has the best service in your area. you won't be under contract, you won't have any obligations, and you get the best price. buy once, cry once, as they say.not only that, but you get the phone as samsung intended, with all features (samsung cloud, caller id, device maintenance) intact and zero carrier meddling.
it may not be the flagship galaxy s phone anymore but this phone is still a work of art. i've owned mine for 6 months going and it still feels like using a brand new phone. this is partly thanks to the recent android oreo update (finally!) though nougat was still running strong up to before the update with just a few noticeable lags. throughout the 6 months, i was expecting some major drop-off in performance as a lot of users say samsung phones do over time. i didn't really experience this. maybe during the next 6 months? who knows, but the phone is still amazingly smooth and feels like a high-power piece of tech, despite being surpassed by the note 8 and s9 series. it's not flagship but it is still top-tier, especially compared to mid-range phones that it is creeping into the price range.battery life: it has been very good, but not amazing, but it survives medium-heavy use with a few ticks of power left at the end of the work day. i normally go home with 20-40% left in the late afternoon, depending on use. i've seen it make it to the end of the night without a top-up charge with medium to light use. it is dependable for a full day of use though not more than that. you will definitely want to charge it at bedtime. i don't ever use power saver mode though that is an option if need be and don't really tinker with the battery settings. in conclusion, it is fine with its default settings and you don't have to constantly monitor and change settings to save the phone. the battery only really takes a beating when you use youtube or play games non-stop. in that case, it will last a few hours.performance: i am an average user. i use average apps like facebook, instagram, dropbox, youtube, some games here and there. with nougat, performance was as expected for a flagship with some stuttering on apps that use the internet. for example, scrolling down video and news feeds, you get some stutter but nothing you would think the phone froze. one annoying thing is a lag that occurs after you tap an icon to open an app. after you tap an icon, sometimes it would take a full second for the phone to respond, making you think the tap didn't register and as you are about to tap again, the app finally opens and runs smooth. this lag seems to be specific to samsung phones and seems to be caused when you force-close apps. when you try to open the app again, it takes longer to load back up. i recently found out you aren't supposed to force-close apps so this can be avoided by not force-closing apps. as of the oreo update, i haven't noticed this lag anymore. the ui has gotten ridiculously smooth since the update. oreo has made a major difference in refreshing the phone's performance. it almost feels like running stock android. almost...display: this is the best aspect of this phone. i love staring at the phone screen. regardless of how much older this phone gets compared to new models, the display will always make the phone look sexy. i pick my wallpapers with care because it lends such a strong attribute to the phone experience with this display. colorful images with a black background really makes things pop and almost look 3d. it is so heavily immersive you forget you're looking at a screen. hd pictures come to life (not literally of course). the blacks are true blacks which really makes a difference. if there is anything special about the phone, it is the viewing experience which is a major selling point because that is something you experience every time you use the phone. this display turns me into a drooling fanboy. the infinity display might turn some people off but i love it. it adds dimension to what is on the screen as you see it falling off the edges rather than being cut off at a bezel, so you get the illusion the image keeps going on forever. it's an unique touch that is exclusive to samsung though it is best to see it in person to know whether you like it or not. yes, it does create some added glare on the screen in bright light, but the trade-off is something special.another thing to point out, the oleo-phobic coating actually works well at repelling fingerprints and feels really nice. it has this soft but smooth gliding feel to it that i haven't experienced with another phone. you fingers feel at home with the touch display. it is not 100% at repelling fingerprints, especially with dirty or greasy fingers, but it gets the job done well. especially when you compare it to the back glass, which is a ridiculous fingerprint magnet. use a phone case because the back glass will always look hideous with fingerprints....overall: i might cover more aspects in the future but will leave it there for now. yes, the phone has some flaws (audio, fragility of being all-glass, the fingerprint sensor is actually quite bad for me, some issues with the camera, lack of software updates though we did finally get oreo, did i mention the audio?, etc.) but the full package is something great, especially as it moves into mid-range territory. i give it 5 stars not because it is a perfect phone but because its features strongly overcome its flaws and leave you with a lasting impression that will keep you looking forward to what samsung has in store next.
the samsung galaxy s8+ is stunning from every angle. it’s easily the  best android phone i have ever held.the best display on the market currently.great software experience.the camera works in every light and takes the best pictures.reliable hardware and wonderful design, very fast.it feels great in the hand.setup takes about few minutes then you get a software update, mine is unlocked and works great with verizon.bixby works ok as an assistant but you can always use google assistant and it works great.it is an engineering masterpiece, outstanding performance and the finest big smartphone that you can buy currently.it comes with high end headphones.
i like the phone in general its an amazingly dense piece of technology.  one feature in particular i was looking for was barometric altimeter and that works well in this phone.  ride with gps app can keep accurate topography on my rides.  i have no interest in adopting another voice assistant in my life though, so the bixby stuff is kind of annoying.  i removed the button actuator from my case because it was being pressed when i took the phone from my pocket or just whenever i picked it up to do something else.  the bicycle mount that i use with it also would press that button.  the moto x touch free voice assistant is superior to the button.i'm not sure that the curved screen adds real utility for me.  its cool but i  think i'd prefer the phone to be flat so that a simple glass protector can be used even if that makes the phone a couple of mm wider.the vr viewer device works really nice with this phone and its hi res screen, and the battery life is considerably better than what i was used to with motox phones.  although the curved screen is kinda cool, it makes using a conventional glass protective cover impossible, and i have now shattered my phone after 4 weeks and this is a really expensive screen to fix.  i'm having a little buyers remorse right now.  turns out that since i am inside the 90 day warranty, samsung will repair it for about $206 wihich is cheaper than buying a kit on ebay.  packing it up to send away for that tomorrow.  5 - 7 business day estimated turn around.  the s8 active is interesting but more than 2x the price.  given my usage profile, bulkier and more durable would be an acceptable trade off.update on the repair:  it went smooth, i was billed as expected and got the phone back in a few days.  then i drove off from home with the phone on the roof one day and a neighbor returned it to me in tact.  just a tiny scratch on one corner of the front glass.full disclosure, i did drop this phone several times before the killer drop which was a stupid situation where i was holding it over my head to get wifi signal over a barrier..  given that it is front and back glass, its not as fragile as you might think.  still, its glass, so dropping it on a rock doesn't end well and the direct bonded oled + touch + 3d glass assembly is not cheap to replace when it happens.
great phone for the most part. broke the glass on the back the first day by inadvertently leaning on it while it was in my pocket. also chipped the back when it dropped 2 feet onto concrete. get a case if you get this phone! also, i wish the fingerprint scanner was on the front instead of the back of the phone so you could unlock it without picking it up.
just after 1 year both front and rear camera failed. hardware failure, and guess what! the cameras are integrated into the m.b. which makes this a cost prohibitive repair. this fine flagship of a phone has also decided to randomly die with a totally drained battery in less than 8hrs. without any open apps or even using the phone. this was my first experience with a samsung flagship phone. (i was an iphone user previously, owned every new apple flagship phone up to the iphone 7 without a single issue.) this will be my last as well. the feeling i get from samsung is: tough luck you should have bought an extended warranty! nice.
i have 2 weeks with it and yesterday fell down and it is brocken now 🤧😠😹
this phone has been way below expectation.  this my third galaxy and this one already has to be sent back for repair.  i've had it 2 weeks and to send it for repair. will require almost 2 weeks.i'm a business owner so really????  perhaps friends are right...should have gone to an i phone 8.
this is a new phone. after charging the phone it shows green screen and this is a piece of crap. i will not suggest anyone to buy it from amazon unlock phone. i will have to get it repaired at authorised dealer. i bought this phone on may 20, 2018 and today it is july 16, 2018 and this piece of crap is not working.
i bought my s8 phone somewhere else, but the #1 issue with this phone is that it is the most fragile phone in existence. a 1 foot drop can shatter the screen or back glass. they might have fixed the glass in later models but if they didn't it is fixable! go to ebay and search for galaxy s8  screen replacement. make sure it is not just a glass screen protector. it should come with a set of tools to replace your screen and/ or back. basically you'll heat the front or back glass and cut away at the adhesive all around the edges and use a pieces of plastic cards to wedge in the sides as you cut all around it to prevent the screen from sticking back to the phone. the kit comes with new glue. search youtube for how to videos. you will have to unscrew the back and disconnect several connectors. if you do not think you can do it cell phone repair shops can fix this phone for you. the kit is only $25 on ebay,  i don't know what shops charge. you can rest easy now, don't be afraid of literally bricking your phone
bought this phone from best buy june of 2017.  started to play a solitare game for a few hours a day.  now i notice that the parts the amoled display are burned in.  i thought that burn in went away with plasma tvs and the old crt monitors of years past, but samsung has re-introduced the problem.i like the phone otherwise, but i know this screen burn in issue will really annoy me.  samsung should be ashamed of themselves ffor using a display type that easily burns in.before you buy, google amoled display and burn in and you will get all the dope on this serious issue.
a great phone ruined by a dedicated bixby button that can't be disabled. bixby is samsung's attempt to force their siri-like solution on the world. i hit this button several times a day and everyone around me is forced to listen to this stupid brriing sound while i try to kill the app. other reviewers talk about how easy it is to disable it. you cannot disable it.again a great phone, but for me no amount of other features can make up for forcing me to deal with bixby every day.
i bought this phone not 6 months ago and the motherboard went out. can't be fixed! now i see there's only a 30 day return? what a ripoff! i want my money back!!!
the phone we received was a counterfeit. if you have doubts if it is a fake, do some research. when i researched, i found things to try and confirm if it is a true samsung phone or a knockoff. i did some things like, tap on the back a see if it is plastic or glass and look at the size of the bevel of the phone. buyer beware!
bought for my wife for christmas was delayed for 2 days then when i recieved it i opeened it there was no phone inside only a charger amd owners manual
excellent phone.  the only three things keeping me from giving this a 5 star rating are:1) no replaceable battery.  if the phone locks up you have to hope holding down the down and power buttons will interrupt the phone and force a reset.  also, when the battery will no longer hold a charge you are sol (and this will happen sooner or later...it will force you to buy a new expensive phone even if a new battery would fix the issue at a much reduced cost).2) bixby...just plain annoying!  the button is in an awkward location and when you hold the phone horizontally it causes bixby to turn on unless you stretch your hand/fingers into awkward locations.3) curved glass.  while this looks sleek and ""sexy"" it is kinda annoying.  if somebody is standing anywhere near you they can see what is going on on your phone.  also makes screen protectors a lot more expensive and elaborate.can't argue much with the price though, much cheaper here on amazon than anywhere else.
it sucked
bricked in a month!!! need to now ship it to repair center in texas, minimum of 3 weeks process for repairs :(
product was a lemon, within a week out of the box developed touchscreen problems. contacted samsung technical support and was told the only recourse i had was to ship the device out to some nebulous repair facility for approximately 1 month. was acknowledged as a defect yet would still not exchange device for a functional unit without a 1 month turnaround.i have used galaxy devices from s3-s6 and after this will never purchase another samsung electronic of any variety.
i feel the need to warn people--do not buy this phone. i have been a lifelong samsung galaxy customer and was very excited when i got my samsung galaxy s7 edge about a year and a half ago. this phone is a hunk of junk and samsung is wrong to continue selling it. do your research (on help forums not websites selling the product) and you will see that there  are a myriad of common problems such as pixel failure, complete screen failure, sd card corruption--the list goes on. my problems began about three months in to having the phone. so much money was spent on it that i'm stuck with it for the foreseeable future. samsung continues to deny responsibility for these faulty devices and will not send replacements or issue refunds. i bought mine through t-mobile and because i'd previously had great experiences with samsung galaxy products, did not opt-in to purchase the warranty. i took the phone in to an independent electronics service center several months ago and had them replace the screen on the device for $390. this took care of the notorious ""pink line"" these phones get across the screen inditing an impending complete screen failure for about six weeks. the line returned in all it's obnoxious and infuriating glory. again, i could go on endlessly with other complaints--but trust me you and anyone who glances at your phone won't be able to ignore the screen problem.i will not be buying a samsung product again.
it gets stuck. have to  force restart frequently.
i'm going to start out this review by stating that i have basically hated the galaxy s phones since they've come out.  i loved my old samsung flip phone, but when they made the move to android, i just couldn't get into them.  i read how amazing the super amoled screen was, and i thought it was garbage.  it was grainy and the colors were much too garish and off.  the ui was cartoony and had weird colors.  over the years, though, samsung slowly stripped away the bloat, refined their screens, cleaned up their android skin, and after all this time i can finally say that they've sold me.the feel:the first thing i noticed with this phone was how amazing it feels.  it's crazy thin, and encased in cool, smooth curved glass.  it has just the right amount of heft to make it feel premium.  it feels like a smooth, elegant and flat pebble.  with the infinity screen it (and its brothers the s8+ and note 8) is easily the most attractive phone i've ever seen, a departure from the older galaxy s phones which had never struck an aesthetic note with me.while the elongated shape of the phone seems odd at first, and actually makes the screen more narrow than other flagships, it works well for accessing the entire screen with one hand.  while it's still a stretch, it's more managable that way and makes the new on-screen navigation keys less obtrusive.  speaking of the on-screen keys, i've never been a fan until now.  they work well and the home ""button"" even has a vibrating ""click"" when you press it in, which i like for turning on your screen and unlocking it in one shot.the physical buttons are a bit too easy to accidentally press, which i don't like, and the bixby button (which i'll get to later) is unnecessary and makes the volume keys harder to find.as much as i like the design, this phone needs a case.  i don't mean that as a bad thing, although for some people i'm sure it will be.  it's delicate.  the all-glass design makes it highly vulnerable to breaking, as you'll find reading reviews and watching drop tests.  the edge display detects accidental touches on occasion.  the volume keys are too clicky.  the phone is thin and smooth which makes it too easy to drop.  a case solves all of these problems.  even if i didn't work in construction (which i do), i would put a case on this phone.  i personally went with the spigen rugged armor samsung galaxy s8 case, spigen® [rugged armor] galaxy s8 case cover with resilient shock absorption and carbon fiber design for galaxy s8 (2017) - black- 565cs21609 case, which i highly recommend.  there's even a youtube video where a guy drops it on tile floor and it just bounces, with no damage whatsoever.software:for years samsung's touchwiz was bloated and ugly.  i hated the cartoony look and the garish colors (which were made worse by the extreme oversaturation of the super amoled screen).  but now, with the paring down of bloat, it's finally become useable.  a while back samsung also introduced a theme engine into their phones and i'm glad they did.  i was able to change all of the default samsung apps and menus into the black shades that i love so much.  you can even replace the icons with a different themes, although i ended up using nova launcher with some icons i had bought for it.i like the way samsung has set up their apps.  they are clean, usable, intuitive, but still full of handy features.  probably my least favorite is the gallery, although my complaints are minor.  my issue is that the pictures are all clumped into a giant, solid wall of pictures, which makes it difficult to differentiate between each file.  the little overlays that tell you if it's a video or a photo, etc. are in plain white text that sometimes is hard to read against lighter pictures.  but the email app, dialer, calendar, system menus, etc. are all a pleasure to use.  everything runs fast and i even found myself using the split screen feature for the first time ever (i had to do some calculator work and type numbers into a spreadsheet) which impressed me.there is still bloat though.  samsung has a bunch of redundant features that mirror those of google's, which aggravates me.  it would be fine if i planned on sticking to the samsung phone ecosystem for the rest of my life, but i'm not even close to making that commitment.  i still use all of google's services, because i can use them on any android phone.  you get samsung calendars, samsung health, samsung pay (which i'll elaborate more on), samsung backup, and others.  it's mostly not a chore to use google's features instead, but you really need to pay attention on things like the calendars and contacts to make sure you're using their google equivilants.to be honest i didn't even try bixby.  google assistant is more than i need, and i don't like having an extra home screen or a button specifically for samsung's digital assistant.  fortunately you can completely disable both the button and the service, but you have to fully enable it and set it up before you can do that.  the button is not capable of being set for anything else, so if you disable bixby you basically end up with a useless button on the side of your phone.the galaxy s8 has the infinity edge screen so that means it comes with the edge shortcuts.  this is a menu you can slide out from the side of your screen and run apps, call contacts, etc. with.  there are actually a ton of extra features and screens you can download for it, but in the end i didn't see the need for one more thing on my screen.  that being said, i think that if a person set it up and used it regularly, it may become a handy feature.samsung pay is a feature i was surprised by.  my phone came with a promotional $50 credit via samsung pay so i was obligated to use it.  the first time i tried it, it was just like in the commercial: the cashier assured me that they couldn't do it, and she clumsily fumbled with the card scanner trying to figure out just how it was going to happen.  i calmly reached over and waved my phone over the reader, and like magic, it accepted payment.  i got a receipt on my phone and happily went on my way.  i've used it three times total, and the first two times it worked, but the third it failed even though the reader specifically said it worked with samsung pay.  as cool as the first two times were, i didn't appreciate looking like a fool while i waved my phone around a card reader like an idiot.hardware:another feature i was surprised by was the fingerprint reader.  i found myself using it in my money apps, which makes them much simpler.  it's very quick and let me log into my wells fargo and paypal apps instantly, which is convenient for checking balances, sending payments, etc.  yes, the reader has a terrible location next to the camera.  however, this is another feature that is fixed by putting a case on your phone.  once you have a cutout for the camera, your finger can easily find the edge of the hole where the reader lies, making it essentially a non-issue.battery life so far has been great.  this is the seventh android phone i've owned, and i don't recall any of them getting phenomenal battery life.  my galaxy s5 i briefly owned (used, to replace an lg g3 with a cracked screen) got terrible life but that could have been other factors.  this one gets me through a full work day with moderate social media use, and in today's world that's the most i hope for from a cell phone.  i do have to put it on the charger in the evening, but only briefly and then it gets me through bedtime.  the battery is not removable however so keep that in mind.i've never tried wireless charging before, but i did with this phone simply because the chargers are cheap and easily available, and i had to buy new cables anyway for the new usb c standard, so i snagged a wireless charger from amazon.  i didn't use the samsung charger or cable so i'm sure it could have been faster, but in about 4 hours it filled up the battery from almost dead.  this works well for me for charging overnight, but you can't use your phone while it's lying on the pad so it might not be great for other uses.call quality has been wonderful.  the volume of the ear speaker is actually more than i need, which is a good thing.  i'd rather turn the audio volume down on a call then top it out and wish it would go louder.  the external speaker is adequate, not being overly quiet but not really sounding impressive in any way.  i didn't get any complaints on speakerphone mode.the screen almost needs its own catagory.  as i stated, for years i've hated super amoled.  i don't get how people thought the early screens looked good.  the saturation was so high, and the colors were off, so that when the brightness was up (and these displays are bright) it made my eyes bleed.  but finally, with this phone, i feel that the colors and saturation are perfect.  the screen is super bright too, and in fact samsung's auto-brightening technology learns what setting you use at different light levels, making this the first android phone i've ever had auto-brightness turned on with.  the resolution is actually turned down when you buy the phone, which i recommend not messing with.  you can turn it up to 4k, but it's not needed and the battery will be drained more quickly.  as it is, pictures and text are extremely clear.  everything just looks so great on this screen, i find myself staring at it sometimes just to admire it.  the infinity edge feels good too, giving it a nice rolled over feel when you swipe towards the sides.  the phone has a feature called always on display, which leaves the clock, battery percentage, and little notification icons on your screen even when it's locked.  the brightness is turned down so that you don't get screen burn-in, and i found that i liked this feature, which didn't seem to affect battery drain.the camera is one of the reasons i bought this phone.  i've heard for a few years now that apple and samsung cameras are always neck and neck in quality.  in practice, i'm mostly happy with my choice.  in well lit conditions pictures come out wonderful.  colors are great and they've very clear.  burst shots are amazing, shooting literally 60 pictures in about a second.  low light shots were a mixed bag, though.  the lighting in the pictures is definitely brighter than in real life, which is great, but for whatever reason once you hit a certain threshold the colors become washed out and any movement at all causes blurring.  this is a problem common to cameras and is related to aperture and shutter speed, but i honestly expected this phone camera to do better.  perhaps it's a setting i need to enable, but as of right now i was a little disappointed.  however, if this phone camera is near the top of the heap, i suppose i don't have much choice but to accept it.summary:i know this has been a long-winded review but a phone is a major purchase in a person's life and i feel like i needed to share my full experience to buyers.overall i love this phone.  there are no major issues with it and using it is a joy.  i'm sure it's partly the new phone effect, but i find myself trying to come up with reasons to use it so i can enjoy the beautiful screen and snappy performance.  it has a few minor flaws here and there, and a bit of the obligatory samsung bloat, but so far it's been a wonderful experience.  i would highly recommend it.
awful for photographers. notice i said photographers and not photography because i'm not referring to the phone camera itself, i'm referring to the phone display. i shoot pictures on both digital and film to share on social media. the camera on the phone is great, not on par with some other flagship offerings, but the ability to shoot raw dng and edit in phone is much appreciated. however, as a photographer who shoot everything from landscape to macros to portraits, i must admit the phone display is absolute garbage. and i knew this coming in as some reveiwers such as mkbhd warned about the warmer and more saturated colors of this phone, particularly the red tones. here's where the issue lies for me. i shoot a photo of a couple during an engagement session on my digital equipment, throw the picture on my computer with calibrated monitors and color grade to my liking yet maintaining accurate skin tones to the best of my abilities. when i upload the edited images to my phone, the skin color looks like a pumpkin barfed on an magenta crayon. i checked the images on an a few iphones and lg phones and they look very close to how they did on my calibrated monitor. this poses several problems, 1. people who view my work on galaxy phones think i suck at photography unless they realize that their display is at fault and 2. when taking raw images on the phone and editing with readily available apps, which is why i picked this phone, the colors i see and believe to be accurate isn't accurate at all! so my workflow would be to take the raw image on the phone, throw on my computer to edit and load back on the phone to share, you see how the workflow is slowed down considering i wanted all that work to be done promptly on the phone? i will admit that for landscape and macro where saturated colors actually enhances the images (depending on personal taste), this is a non issue. i just wish the display wasn't so pumped up like it is. also i adjusted the display colors to cool it down as much as possible and the skin tones are still awful.the phone itself is top of the line, blazing fast, durable, water proof, detailed display. nothing more you can ask for in a phone besides more muted reds in the display.
pretty cool
there is a lot of great about this phone and that's why it's so maddening that samsung seems to go out of their way to want to irritate you and cripple it.  i just had my greatest of all time s5 crap out.  it was getting unreliable after 4 years and anker stopped making its amazing godzilla battery for it.  from its hay day the only thing it needed an upgrade on was its camera and be touch bigger.  it was fast enough, a good size expandable memory and number 1 it could have an expanded battery.why did samsung take away the removable battery feature!  me and everyone i know think this is beyond stupid.  to the point of not trusting the company at all.  like a car company that has en engine that can run on its own solar panel but makes the car where it can only have square wheels.  why do something ao stupid.  i read the reviews for years where the idiot press commented about the ""cheap feeling"" plastic back.  and mabe samsung took it to heart.  plastic is light, flexable , removable and can bounce a bit when dropped or can be replaceable.  i with the screen could be plastic too.so what to they do.  make the back glass too?  so smart.  let's take my expensive portable  electronics and make it more breakable, heavy and slippery!!!!  wth?  i cant even shop for a case bafore it falls out of my pocket from 2.5 ft high and dents the charging port and cracks the back glass.glass?  why use glass? everyone is going to put it in a case anyway and now doubly so. so why even bother with glass?  and why cripple the battery capability.  i'll be getting a battery case for mine and now i'll have to manage 2 batteries as they charge and discharge each other and wear each other both out.next is the form factor.  are we making the std form factor for 9 yr old girls now?  is that the new marketing sweet spot?  make the phone bigger but also less useful at the same time.  what aspect ratio is this thing?  samsung, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.3rd.  rounded screen edges.  show me the customer who said ""wow good phone but can we distort the edges more and make it so i accidentally press commands while i hold it.""4th is bixby.  yes we needed google now to extend into the apps more and get more granular so why not build on google now?  because the basic bixby sucks.  it can't get a command right.  and even after correcting it 4 times still can't recognise my town name.  but they added a whole special extra button for that junk pile.  take away the home button but add a special bixby button, thanks.now to just wait for the inevitable moment where i need to do a battery pull for a reboot.competitors take note.  make a rugged expandable, practical smart phone and you will collect a very loyal market segment.  give us a 2 or 4 or even a 6x sized battery.  let us switch between.  how about an internal micro sd and an external to pop in and out. how about a charging port and an hdmi or dual combos for when the first charging port wears out.  we dont care that its octo core or has trillion by bazillion screen rez.  just make a phone good enough, useful enough and tough enough to be useful everyday.
its a little hard to get use to compared to the s5 i had. but otherwise i like it
crashed within 3 months of receiving the phone, wont turn on.  ""us warranty"" expired 10 days ago.  all sorts of reboots have failed.  not the battery, but the motherboard or however it's called.  i tried emailing customer support but it keeps bringing me back to the purchase screen.  does anybody need a paperweight?
thank you
this phone is very fragile, i accidentally dropped it 1 ft high and it broke in 3 different places. it is tough to find a good screen protector that protects the phone and not degrade screen sensitivity. the setting to increase touch sensitivity which was available in the s5 is now gone so there is no way around this problem. the thoughtless design of this phone will not allow you to solve this problem. either add a ballistic glass protector to the screen which solves the fragility of this phone but turns it into a useless phone since you have to press really hard to get the screen to respond, or not add a glass screen protector which leaves this phone subject to breaking sooner or later. it is as if samsung intentionally designed the phone so that the screen will break (so they can sell more $200 'gorilla' glass screen'?) other gimmicks are the 'bixby' app which pops up constantly if you swipe the phone unintentionally in the wrong direction, and the edge screen which accidentally activates some menus while holding it. so you will have to try to hold this slippery phone by avoiding the front edges which increases the chance of dropping and breaking it.
hellooo my screen phone was broken.could you help me please for repair
bixiby button it is a pain, got watch out how grab your  phone  from anywere that button will initiate bixby.
the phone has so many problems like poor network connectivity which causes frequent call drops, call and text lag, wifi and bluetooth connectivity issues. the seller says the phone is new but after so many issues i am not sure; its more likely that this is a bad refurbished model of the phone. i bought it as a gift and i feel so bad for the person i gifted it to as this turned out to be worst than his 5-yr old phone with a shattered screen! :(
this is the best phone out there and why would you carry an $800 phone in your pocket?? especially without a glass screen protector?? that's a bad call and there are products out there that strengthen the glass. why people choose to put them in there pocket is beyond me and i want to protect my big investment. i have an otter box case and screen protector on mine. i work construction and have had no problems with it. so quit complaining and protect your 800 buck phone. duhhh
samsung galaxy s8 64gb unlocked phone - international version (midnight black)i love the galaxy s8! this is a huge deal for me to write a post of the following caliber because i'm not a tech geek or even someone who is very giving in terms of technology satisfaction, but the s8 warrants it.  for a long time (possibly for some too long for some), i was quite content using my outdated, but excellent s3.  based on my research, not only was the s8 the most current, but many reviews suggested it was one of the best phones since the s3 and it is. by now you've heard most of the great features, but now you get to hear it from a 50-something female. let's start with the look. it's just a beautiful phone. it feels good in my fairly large hands, and i feel like i get more because the picture bleeds to the sides. speaking of getting more, i like the larger size.  as much as i loved my s3, over the years i did begin to long for a larger phone, instead of deferring to my surface tablet.  when i purchased my s8, i was tempted to get the plus, but as it turns out, i don't need it.  the best feature for me hands down is the life of the battery and the super fast charger.  do you remember how quickly the s3 used up the battery life? yes, i know this is very old news for the thousands who upgrade their phone every year, but for the few thousand in my age group who hold on to technology devices for comfortability, i think you'll find this information helpful.  with the s8, you will be able to leave your portable charger home because you won't need to use every few hours. my s8 is everything!  i've even started going to 1-1 personal samsung training so that i can optimize use of my phone.  ok young, middle-agers: buy it, then write about it!
i have had this phone since the day it came out. i am a poor college student but my phone that i had previously was not powerful enough for my nursing clinical. i waited to review this device because i wanted to run it through nursing clinical before i have it a good review.1). this phone is a very practical size. it has a large enough screen to be pleasant and easy to use buy without being clumsy in hand. the super amoled display is great the best on the market simply put.2). software and performance: so we all know samsung has had its software issues in the past. it is just a really heavy and poorly optimized skin. on top of that, still being on 7.0 nougat and not 7.1.1 or 7.1.2 is kind of frustrating. they are improved versions of android with much better battery optimizations. as far as samsung experience is concerned, this is a huge improvement from previous iterations of touchwiz. it is much smoother and more lightweight than before and it helps. with that being said it still has stutter issues. not lag but stutter. no lag meaning there is no delay response when opening apps and such. but it does fail to open some apps smoothly sometimes. the snapdragon 835 and 4 gb of ram do enough however to power through everything. i have an app on my phone that we use during clinicals. it has an entire library or medical terminology and practices that we need to be able to call upon at a moment's notice. this phone does not fail me. i also game frequently and this device blows through it.3). camera: people and reviewers have complained that the camera is just not improved enough. hmm...thats funny because a lot of those same reviewers have also said it is still one of the top 3 cameras on the market. it is very reliable and takes some incredible pictures. i use it a lot in class for some blackboard notes. clear as day even in dark conditions. just a great great camera overall.4)battery: this has been a very controversial aspect of this phone. some people have had good battery life, and some have had not so good battery life. i personally get good battery life but not stellar. i keep the phone on 1440p resolution because that is what i paid for, and i get about 4 1/2 hours of battery life. i wake up at 6:30 every morning and my phone lasts me tulle about 11 at night with about 20% to spare. i have had and seen better but the battery has been able to at least keep it's charge very well despite being several months old now.5). overall: this device is a solid overall package. i think it nails most things but has a few of its querks. a lot of people will be wondering if the galaxy s8 should be dumped for the not 8. i would say no. i would personally wait for the s9 or in my case the note 9. this phone is basically a smaller note 8 with a single rear camera and no s pen. unless you have money burning a hole in your pocket the note has nothing outrageous to offer in comparison.
okay so to start off samsung made an incredibly beautiful device however next time they should spend more time working and the hardware functionality.softwaremy phone before the samsung s8 was the nexus 6p.  needless to say the transition from having no bloat to a bunch of samsung bloat took awhile to get use to. touchwiz or tizen is not as bad as it use to be but the part i found most annoying was samsung's very own so, bixby.  samsung even gave bixby it's own button to access it but i found myself always pressing it on accident and unintentionally. when i would use an ai it would always be google assistant it seemed more practical than bixby. needless to say bixby is still young and has much to grow but it didn't really leave a lasting impression for me.batterythe battery on the s8 was not bad considering it's a quad hd bezleless screen.  when default settings(quad hd resolution mid brightness) were active on the battery i would get around 4 hours of screen on time.  when i changed the setting to full us resolution and low brightness i was able to get through a whole day.  the standby time on this phone is also great. my phone would have around 10% battery life before i went to sleep and when i would wake up it's only be at 8%.cameraunlike most manufacturers samsung didn't choose to go dual cameras on this device which wasn't really a bad thing.  this is one of the phones that proves more is not always better(more being more cameras). the back camera does a great job in low light performance and in my opinion still took better photos than the iphone 7. the selfie camera was adequate it wasn't great in my experience cause samsung software tends to smooth out the image alot when using the selfie camhardwarethis is the area where i just did not have a good experience with this phone. for starters the fingerprint reader.  i'm not going to complain about the placement but rather how accurate it is.  i had to same the same finger twice and i still can't unlock it on the first try.  i am frequently having to unlock my phone with my password instead cause of how many times it fails to read my fingerprint.  the charging port was another issue i was having. samsung tends to promote wireless charging for a reason and it's because their charging port is not that great. i use the charger that came in the box and my phone sometimes doesn't even charge or sometimes it doesn't even read that it's a quick charge compatible charger. i tried other chargers but it was even harder to charge.  the other bad part of their hardware is that bixby button it just isn't that needed and would have been better if the button could be remapped to some other function.designoverall the best part of this phone is the design. samsung s8's design are in a class of their own due to those super thin bezles no one has really been able to match.  the edge display just makes the display experience all the better.
very fast and feature-filled phone. hardware delivers as promised and easily outshines iphone. however, my phone screen cracked while i was in an airplane. the phone was not dropped or struck; it just started cracking from the bottom right corner while i was playing a game. the crack spread across the screen and was quite unsightly, but the phone was functional.i contacted samsung who offered for me to mail in the phone (for free) and they would examine the phone and see if there was any fault in the manufacturing. for $225 they would replace the screen if the cause was not found to be due to an underlying defect.well they just charged me and fixed the phone. i never heard anything or was given any sort of report in regards to whether or not this was a known manufacturing issue. i find that strange given their recent history with abnormal functioning phones.the phone was shipped to me as promise by ups but samsung did not insure the package nor did they require a signature on delivery for this 850 dollar product. alas, the package was swiped from my doorstep. i followed samsung's instructions and filed with ups and samsung about the incident. one week later ups concluded the package was delivered accurately (duh, i knew that). so samsung refiled with ups stating it was stolen. i was reassured that this was the normal sequence of events (odd?). anyways, i'm now on week three without a phone that i didn't exactly consent to being repaired and definitely did not consent to be shipped uninsured and without signature on delivery. everyone at samsung has stayed on script and has been perfectly cordial, but their policies are not helpful in minimizing the inconvenience their defective product has cost me (time off from work, inability to perform work functions without a smart phone, etc...).to conclude, an okay product without the company support to make it as awesome as it could be. oh yeah, and a company with a track record of failing devices who still fails to perform thorough root-cause analyses on their products. at least with my n of 1.note: 2 stars because, prior to the phone randomly breaking, it was a solid product.
weakest screen i've had on a phone. i had a note7 and the screen was indestructible. when i brought it back to the store during the recall, after they refunded me they started throwing the phone to see how much force it could take before breaking. the store employees were tossing it high in the air and it would fall on their hardwood floor unscathed. they eventually got it to break after many, many throws but it withstood so much before finally shattering. i assumed the s8+ would have the same gorilla glass as the note7. nope! in fact, the s8+ has one of the most fragile screens out of any recently released phone. look it up. mine fell out of my pocket about 1.5 ft and shattered, also damaging the lcd itself. additionally, i recently got an ""offer"" from samsung as a note7 owner to trade my phone in for a note8-- they offered me ""up to $450"" for a phone that i paid significantly more for. this will probably be my last samsung phone after my recent experiences with their products.
the phone performs great. i mean really. i haven't had any performance issues since buying the phone. the problem is the curved screen. you absolutely cannot find a good glass screen protector for this phone. if you get the soft plastic ones they'll work but hardly prevent cracked screens from drops. the hard glass protectors will always either leave dead spots on the edges or fall off within a week. often times both. this is a design flaw if you're prone to dropping your phone or work outside of an office. again, the phone works great
if wifi calling is important to you, beware. unlocked phones are not capable, nor can they be enabled per att. articles point to the same issue on verizon. should have done my homework first. hope this helps someone.
problems with the phone within two weeks, terrible experience with samsung in warranty repair who sent the phone whithout the simcard tray and 20 days later still not here. if your product stop working consider this advice, samsung warranty services is terrible. my phone is 4 month old and thanks to them i got to enjoy it for 10 days. i don't know when i'm going to be able to used again.
i have galaxy s8 through verizon. i liked the quality of craftsmanship, performance, and the slick appearance of the phone. however, its screen cracks so easily even with case put on. so be careful when you holding the phone to make sure you don't drop it. otherwise, it will cost you for repair.
i bought this phone unlocked from another source. i was a nexus phone user and was happily into my nexus 5x usage for 1.5 years and it went into a bootloop (a known issue). i had to have a phone immediately so bought an s8.pros;- beautiful design, screen is awesome- i like how samsung shows battery percent and data up/download in the status bar- battery life seems pretty good- microsd card capabilitycons:- screen design (curve) means much easier to break/damage, even with a case- bixby button is easy to hit, a pain. samsung has prevented owners from remapping it.- volume buttons above bixby button, way too high- fingerprint reader location sucks, and shape sucks too. my nexus had it right - center back, big pad and easy quick recognition- samsung touchwiz launcher is better than old days, but still why mess up vanilla android? splitscreen mode not as intuitive as vanilla android. home screen has much wasted space as second row of icons goes well above tray, wasting space. i ended up downloading the google launcher and that made a huge difference- camera is surprisingly not as good as nexus 5x, especially in low light (this is same camera as in nexus 6p, and current pixeli called google and even though my 5x is out of warranty, they are shipping me a refurb 5x free! so i am going to pay the restocking charge and return the galaxy s8, and wait for the google pixel 2. samsung has the name recognition but imho this phone is not as good as people think. google's service was excellent and i'm happy to continue with them where i always have the latest os and latest security updates as soon as they come out.
i have been a loyal samsung customer for many years. however, that has come to a screeching halt. my galaxy s8+ stopped working one night. i did not damage it in any way. went to bed and it was fine, got up the next morning and could not connect to any network. went to at&t for help, they worked the problem for a bit , it was finally decided it had to be sent in to samsung. they received my phone on aug 8. they did not even open the box until aug 13. i received emails from them that day that said this would be repaired in warranty at no cost to me and that the phone would be fixed in 5 business days. that was the last i heard from them. i, however, have reached out to them countless times now. i keep getting shuffled between repair support, customer support and executive customer support ( which by the way means nothing). i have spent over 7 hours total time on the phone with them, been hung up on, lied to about different department availability, spoken rudely to, put on hold for outrageous amounts of time. finally today find out that my phone has been ""repaired"" twice now since sent in and has failed both of its quality control tests. now it is being repaired a 3rd time and will have to go through ""quality control"" again. there is no timeframe given for how long this might take. i have been told repeatedly that no one there can make a decision to replace or refund a phone. i run a small business and i depend on this phone every day. it has been over 3 weeks since i've had it.....and there is no care whatsoever from samsung. be assured, i will let everyone know that i possibly can about this horrible and unfair customer service. shame on you samsung....this family will never purchase another product from this company.
so this is the first time i have actually bought a flagship device from samsung all my previous ones were of the other variety however i can say this is hands down the best device i've had to date.pros:1. the price, considering the device usually goes for 700-800 usd getting in at 574.99 is a very good deal, this was the factor that made me get it over an iphone.2. the camera and video quality is awesome. i've never had pics looking this great.3. its super fast like the boot up was effortless and switching between apps is a breeze.4. since all my previous devices were 1gb ram and 8 gb memory having one now that is 4gb ram and 64gb memory its an eye opener plus having expandable storage with an sd card just won my heart.5. battery life is great. i can go one day without charging with moderate to high usage which is good.6. the speakers are loud af like i was shocked when listening to youtube videos.cons:1. the finger print scanner, this should be a common cry at the moment but its is placed at possibly the most inconvenient place for a finger print scanner.2. the phone is made entirely of glass which for me is a concern cause i'm a klutz so i recommend getting a good case and a tempered glass screen protector.fyi: this phone is unlocked. it can be used with any carrier. i am using it in jamaica right now and it works perfectly fine.i would recommend this phone to anyone because it has good internal and build quality. so this was just my two cents.samsung galaxy s8 unlocked 64gb - us version (midnight black)
i have this phone and it is now less than 4 weeks old.  overnight as it was charging it came up with a moisture detection message and it won't charge.  it has not been in water although it claims to be ""water resistant"".  the bubble gum answer of use a blow dryer or clean with a qtip are not working and again, it hasn't been in water.  if the humidity in the air can render a phone less than a month old unusable it is worthless.  move on to a better option because as you can see on the forum sites, people all over are experiencing the problem.  it is either a hardware or software problem.  the consensus seems to be that it became a problem after the last system update.
i got to put my phones water resistence to the test this summer. while working on my boat my phone slid out of my pocket, i assumed it had gone overboard and into the big blue. it turned out that it slid out while i was selling fish and went to my processing boat in a bag of salmon. my phone then spend the next 2-3 days at the bottom of a fish hold with a few thousand lbs of fish and refrigerated sea water. when they pumped out one of their deckhands found the phone at the bottom, threw it in a bag of rice and got it back to me. worked great, some sound issues at first with the ear speaker but it corrected it self. i dont know if it was luck or good engineering, or both. i figured i needed to give them a review after getting back a working phone from all that. great camra, good data storage the phone is pretty average after that.
theoretically speaking, overall this phone is dreadful. pros are the variety of security features (face recognition, iris scanner and fingerprint scanner) and the option to choose themes. however, the cons definitely outweighed the pros. the cons that were definitely obvious to me were the lack of battery life, the poor picture quality (an iphone 6s has a better camera than this phone) and constant updates. i have had this phone since september of 2018 and i am not happy with it. just a heads up if you are looking into purchasing this phone.
wife recently purchased thru att authorized store. she loved the look and feel of the 8+ and at first, it worked great. however, within a few days it stopped working, displaying no network available error code on screen. problem is, we were at home and my phone, an older samsung s4 active, also with att was working so there definitely was att network service available. turned the phone on and off a few times, still no signal. finally, using my phone, called att customer service. forty five mins later with numerous instructions from att agt, using my phone, finally managed to get her phone up and running with agt stating he had found an error on the part of the store sales clerks initial registration process. ok, fine. fast forward 3-4 days later, same problem + phone was shutting itself off for no reason. back to customer service using her phone this time. it would not allow her to make any outside phone calls or text messages, giving same no network available error code, yet it would allow her to dial customer service using 611, however. another long conversation with att phone rep again who, this time suggested taking phone back to store and have the sim card replaced. phone was now 16 days old since purchase. did exactly that and store clerk changed out sim card. still didn't work. tried 2nd sim card on same visit and it didn't work either.  store clerk then erased electronic serial number in their system, re-typed same ser # back in, reinserted 2nd sim card, rebooted phone and it finally worked but only for about 4 days before same problem occurred again. problem is, she had to go out of town to a funeral and needed a dependable phone. she was so frustrated by now, she had att store switch sim card back over to her old iphone 5, which at least had always been dependable, if not very exciting. thus she was safe on the trip, at least as far as having a phone she could count on again. when she returned home from funeral a few days later, she immediately called att customer service, once again explaining her problem. another 30 min conversation and they now wanted to send her a refurbished phone replacement for a phone she was paying a new phone charge for, not a refurb price. she refused the refurb and the att rep finally told her he was making note in file, recommending the selling att store take it back. she also called samsung directly and their rep told her to take it back to store and have them do a factory reset before sending it in to samsung for warranty repair. samsung rep was sure that would more than likely fix the problem. so she took the s8+ phone back to att store where she bought it, demanding a new phone, since they couldn't seem to fix it. they refused and in stead, sent her sixty miles down the road to an atlanta corporate att store, the mgr of the selling store stating he was sure the corporate store would replace it, what with the att phone rep recommending same. corporate store mgr. was indignant, rude and emphatically refused, stating the selling store should replace it. by now, after several att dog and pony shows, failure on their part to do the right thing, my wife had had enough, drove sixty miles back to selling store, dumped the non working s8+ phone as well as the samsung 8in tablet they had also talked her into buying with the s8+, demanded a refund for all and a receipt for the returned equipment. att store clerk didn't have the authority to do an immediate credit, stating she would have to get the owner to do it over the next few days. seven days go by with no credit on her acct so she now drives back to store, talks with the clerk again, who immediately credits her acct and credit card for all eqpt. store clerk admits that this was 3rd samsung s8+ returned within the last week for similar problems. meanwhile, a few days later a samsung factory rep comes by this att authorized store, poo poo's the apparent s8+'s problems, stating that it was just probably a bad batch of s8 phones, with no other explanation. well, now my wife feels pretty much snake bit by samsung and att over this uncalled for ordeal and is in all probability going to change to verizon or some other carrier and i am sure, by now you have surmised she will not be purchasing a samsung anything. she's too scared of them and what appears to be a lack of current quality control on samsung's part compared to their good reputation in the past. having been an att customer for more than ten yrs, she was very surprised and disappointed to learn of att's apathy and argumentative nature when failing to back up their phone with proper service after the sale. additionally, i have been an att cell phone customer on my line since 1989(formerly bellsouth) and we are long time direct tv customers. after seeing how she was treated i am also considering looking elsewhere for a different carrier and equipment, after continuously being their customer for over 28 yrs. any company and any carrier can have problems. it's how they handle those problems that either insures brand loyalty or causes you to look elsewhere. all they had to do was to do the right thing to start with and give her a new phone that worked. having refused to do that, what can we possibly expect from them in the future. we are currently paying almost $300.00 a month to att for our phone and direct tv service. even that did not motivate them to replace the phone, a phone which at the time was less than a month old. we sincerely hope your experience with both att and the samsung s8+ phone is a better one than hers was. my phone is overdue for an upgrade but living thru her experience causes me great pause in considering any new samsung product, inspite of fact that i have had my s4 active for several yrs with no problems. i have never looked at another cell phone network provider in all my yrs of att service but i now feel compelled to at least see what they can provide.
this phone is pretty good!water resistant. solid build quality. battery lasts a decent amount of time compared to my iphone 7 i got rid of. charges very quickly.interface/operating system could be easier to use. siri is easy. this bixby character is difficult. hope it gets updated soon to make it much better. needs it!
i didn't buy my s8+ from amazon, but i did buy it unlocked. and if you try to activate it with a network under their bring your own device provisions, you need to ask for an isim card. csim and usim type sim cards will not work.
paying almost 900 dollars for a phone and then some for a case you'd think it wouldn't break. my screen has shattered twice now. i've never broken a phone before in my life. i've never dropped this phone either. one minute it's fine and the next it's shattered. it was in my purse all day next to my cloth wallet. i never set my purse down nor did it get hit/leaned on/thrown/etc.. i pull out the phone and it's shattered. i'm so frustrated and angry that something this expensive would break for no apparent reason. twice. if i could give 0 stars, i would. this is absurd. i want my money back.
two stars because a phone this expensive should be an upgrade, not a problem. this phone has trouble casting to chromecast through the home app (sound, no pic) and has trouble connecting to bluetooth. i cannot connect it to my pioneer system in my truck. it will not pair. a quick search revealed this is a common problem with this model.
the phone gets scratches way too easily. this might be the last samsung i buy.
nicest little cell phone slippery like a bar of soap and just as clean a design powerful insides better camera than any iphone complicated features even a repair manual might help to understand. best samsung flagship since galaxy s5.
looks cool, has a bunch of crazy features, good camera and video. but the screen/key pad is horrible. i can barely even use the letters h and t when writing. i have to push h and t about 15 times before it finally works. also the text prediction/swype is horrible. i.o.t is not a word i use but is always being suggested among other gibberish words because the letters h and t don't work so they aren't recognized when trying to swype words. i got the phone free for work so i cant complain too much but if i had my choice i would go back to the motorola droid turbo in a second.
i am really disappointed that this phone just stopped working exactly after one year. i have never dropped this phone but i remember recently every time i use the call swap functionality it freezes but this time it stopped for good. i took it to technicians they opened it they checked battery and all but no fix. money wasted.
phone only lasted two years before losing the ability to charge (low temperature error) and had very poor reception.
this is a great phone let down by one major flaw of a super scratchy screen. i have had an s3 and and s5 in the past and this was a step up. i love the display, the memory, the speed, and the color. if it was just for that i would have given this phone 5 stars. i have had this phone for only 3 days and there is already a bunch of scratches on the screen. and deep enough to pick up with your fingernail. i never had this problem with the previous samsung phones. in fact i went caseless for the entire 2 year life of the s5 and only picked up one scratch when it fell to the floor of the truck once. i haven't treated this phone any different and have not dropped it or otherwise abused it but there are still noticeable scratches and marks. this alone makes the phone a ""do not buy"" in my book. maybe if it was half the price but not at over $600. i seriously think that the screen isn't even glass but plastic. a big step backward for samsung.
best phone i've had yet! beautiful display and advanced features. it takes beautiful pictures, has fast charge and long lasting battery life. charged my phone once and didn't have to charge it again for two to three days and that was with me being on it a lot. my last phone was the lg flex and i wasn't as big on it so i decided to go back to samsung again and my am i happy with my decision. would recommend anyone to definitely give this phone a go. it's pretty expensive but it's worth it. great phone!
i'm not sure if i can get used to this phone coming from a nexus 6. since it's a 5.8"" screen and nexus 6 is 5.9"", i didn't expect there to be a huge difference. but there is. it's so super narrow it's about the same width as a normal ratio 5"" phone. it appears much smaller in person than i expected when i ordered it.that i may be able to adapt to. it's the curved edges that are horrible. not only do they make it appear even more narrow, but things on the edge are slightly distorted and the color is off unless you look at it dead on, and even then i can see a bit of distortion and discoloration on the curved edges. at an angle it's unbearable the way the edges are darker than the rest of the screen. it's especially noticeable when the screen is a solid light color, with the edges having a blue tint.this alone is a deal breaker for me. it's hard to look at. if it was a flat, even surface it would be so much better. i don't predict this gimmick catching on. at least i hope it doesn't.
i'm going to get rid of my s8 plus because of bixby.  i'm tired of it taking over my phone.
one of the best phones. i have been with iphone for more than 5 years and never tried an android phone. thanks to the campaign as i have opted to try it for the first time and i am loving it. the biggest positive for the phone is its display. even camera is very good. i feel they went totally wrong with the fingerprint sensor placement. design of the phone is great.
this is am an awesome phone. look at all the features it as and the 64gb never have to worry about storage.it like everything you want to pack into this device. i love the features and the phone itself. samsung did a great job creating a phone like this.
i had this phone for about a year and one month and was the best phone i ever had. the camera is point and shoot and the screen is amazing. but recently the phone kept restarting and shutting down. i sent it in to samsung and since it is 1 month out of warranty i will have to pay a 70 dollar fee. not a big deal untill they received my device and they now say it is going to be 630 dollars to repair. this is unacceptable and i will never buy another samsung again!
had it in my pants pocket and screen scratched after two days.  never put it into anywhere else that would be endanger it.  there was nothing in the pocket too!!! my friend dropped it from the couch to carpet and it shattered as well. too bad because the software and camera are great. cannot recommend this phone.
if you like to be surprised several times every day by your phone doing something different, this is the phone for you!!!i do like the hardware.terrible software! there are layers and layers and needless, annoying complexity that i don't want or need. the worst thing about this phone is it is unpredictable. today i could not answer an incoming call even though the phone was in my hand! i had been browsing the internet on chrome and could hear the ring  but no interface to answer. a day or two ago i got no interface to shut off the lookout scream feature. sometimes i get the proper interface, other times not! full of surprises!bixby is useless and annoying as well, and so is the ""battery charging"" screen. getting into the phone is a hassle most of the time. sometimes you have to do your pattern, then swipe past a screen or two then do you pattern again. why? who knows. next time it might be different!samsung should stick to hardware and let google do the software. give people android stock phones and stop trying to compete with your own partner. please! please!!! if samsung didn't waste money paying designers and developers to add garbage that degrades they phone, it would probably be better and cheaper.i think letting you answer calls is job one for a phone.mine fails that most basic task...sometimes...because it is clogged with a bunch of kludgy garbage software. very disappointed.
great phone, feels great in the hand, bluetooth 5.0, and finger print sensor works great! takes about 4 hours to get use to it being on the back
still on android 7.0 (sep 01 2017). completely outdated firmware, a lot of bloatware on device. very unfortunate upgrade policy. great hardware, but software / firmware sucks. never again samsung, just very much behind.
the screen cracks easily  and you will be out $700+ dollars (not covered in manufacturer's warranty).  you don't need to drop the phone to crack the screen.this is a warning, google ""samsung galaxy s8"" and screen and see what you come up with.if samsung doesn't issue a recall, there may soon be a class action lawsuit.
the phone is fine, but god help you if you have a customer service issue. absolutely the worst! that's saying something with companies like comcast in existence, but samsung takes the cake. they ignore you as long as humanly possible (do not reply at all--let alone in the 24 hours they promise to). if you do manage to get in touch with them, they'll transfer you 4-5 times before telling you the department you need is closed. i pay at&t $32 a month for this so i'm stuck, but i will never purchase another samsung product as long as i live and i recommend you don't either--they don't care about theit customers at all.
some of these good reviews sound like they were written by samsung employees or sellers. seriously. this has to be one of the worst samsung phones i've ever purchased (i've had 4 different versions over the last six years).  the swipe feature used when texting will more often than not pick an odd or nonexistent word instead of the one you want.  the voice to text feature is almost useless.  you seriously can't tell it you want a comma placed?  on my old phone you could.  and even yelling clearly results in almost half the wrong words.  both of these features have gone backwards at least 2 generations.  as usual battery life sucks.  if you play any games and use your phone what i consider to be  a pretty normal amount throughout the day, the charge won't even last the day.  i'm typically recharging it around 4 pm so i have a full charge before i go out at night. the touch response is terrible and often i have to hit the screen several times to get it to select what i want (this may partially be a result of the gadget guard black ice screen guard which is glass and cracks super easily).  and while the infinity screen offers a nice view of pictures and videos, any normal person that holds onto their phone will naturally touch the side and the phone allows this to select random things and jump away from whatever you were doing.  i'm not an apple fan at all (even though my husband and son are trying to convert me), i just wish samsung would get it together so i'm not swearing at the damn thing everyday.  all this money and i wish i had my s6 back.  frustrating.
s8+ is a really well made phone and has a nice feel when you hold it in your hand. recommend taking accident protection plan. the much criticized bixby is not too bad and you need to spend time to train your assistant, after that it works great. never expected another company to beat apple in build quality, looks and intuitive interface....samsung s8+ proved me wrong.... love the phone
the only thing about this phone i don't like is bixby. the placement of the button is such that every time i picked up the phone, i was hitting the button and activating it. it is annoying as hell! i finally found out how to deactivate the entire app and the button, now i love my phone!!
phone features are good but durability is horrendous. glass is way too fragile! phone fell on carpet (with case) and screen cracked. this is my forth  samsung s5, s6, s7 & s8 and the others held up well.  consider the cost to repair and or insurance + cost of phone! very disappointing.
i actually bought this through bestbuy and i absolutely loved it for the first year, but right after it came out of warranty a really nasty screen burn manifested and fixing it costs like $300
it's hard to express how disappointed i am with this phone. the hardware is incredibly fragile and without a very bulky case the screen will inevitably break sooner rather than later. after 5 months the battery is losing its life already. the software is just as bad. the keyboard is jumpy and the autocorrect is always giving me terrible suggestions and sometimes just clears what i've typed entirely for no apparent reason. bixby is constantly trying to insert itself into my life when i have no interest in it. apps are constantly crashing and the performance of the phone is generally underwhelming, making it frustrating to use. it's one redeeming quality was that it was waterproof, however i doubt it still is now that the screen is cracked. if i was able to, i would go back to my s5, which was a much higher quality phone in my opinion.
the phone over heats way too much and after five months of using the phone it stopped working, so i won't advise anyone to buy it
love the camera, love the phone, love the memory card slot, love the speed. if i could put a battery in it worth while i would give it 6 stars.
i had a galaxy 4 and was due for an upgrade.  it needed a new battery too. so decided to get an 8 plus. there are more days than not that i think i should get a new battery for my 4 and use that. i do like some of the upgrades from the 4, love love love the camera but this phone can have a mind of its own.
i can describe this entire review as: this will be my last samsung phone and no i will never recommend any samsung phone.first, positive points:* camera is great (i personally think its better at taking pictures under more difficult lighting conditions than iphone 8plus).* usb-c connector* wireless charging* oled display (minus the curved screen)negative,* samsung is terrible about providing os updates, (at least a year behind everyone else, just pathetic, considering it was a top of the line phone..* curved screen, just the worst design period, tempered glass screen protectors do not stay on for more than 5 days.* bixby button is placement is terrible and gets triggered very often* you can't disable bixby button or remap-it to something that is actually useful* very fragile, my screen broke when phone fell down in a car from less than a foot height (hit the seat rail).* the repair cost is insane, i payed 250 to get the screen replaced at (ubreakifix, samsung official repair center), i had to get it repaired 3 times; on top of it, the third time i had to bring it i had to drive 220 miles (round trip), before everything was working like its supposed to (first screen, after repair microphone would not work, then phone jack stopped working).  the last repair technician said, that i should be very cautious about getting this phone wet as it has likely its not going to hold. i should have just cut my losses, payed a bit extra and just get the new iphone 8plus.overall very disappointed in samsung phones...
great phone but had to return. i have t-mobile and this unlocked doesn't do video calling and predictive text only branded t-mobile devices do this.
on top of screen burn in issues, my galaxy s8 spontaneously failed after only a year of use. avoid this brand if possible.
do your research and you will see this is the most breakable phone ever.  mine cracked twice .... without dropping ... even though i have the samsung case designed to protect it.  great phone but that $200 monthly deductible will drive you broke (no pun intended)!
i had a nexus 6p, but it stopped working and i didn't want to fork out the money for a pixel 2 so i decided to get the sumsung s8 plus as part of tmobiles buy one get one free deal. boy was it a mistake. the galaxy s8 is complete junk compare to my nexus 6p. first of all the fingerprint reader is right next to the camera!!! so it's very easy to mistake the camera for the finger print reader when you are not looking and it usually takes me several tries to unlock the phone. second the phone only have one speaker on the bottom compare to the stereo speaker in my 6p. and yes it does make a difference!! third, the curve screen completely sucks, it warps videos and side of webpages and ebook. lastly as of today, it still doesn't have support for the latest android software while my 6p already supported it. in all honesty if i had to choose all over again i would have chosen the lg v30 or pixel 2 or iphone x. heck i would've chosen my old 6p over this phone. so yes please stay away from this phone, it's definitely not worth the price.
iphone user for years, i decided to give this a try.  very stable and solid phone with awesome screen resolution and security enhancements. the iris log in is just one example. no pins, no passwords to enter.  so far i am well pleased and do not miss my iphone at all
the samsung galaxy s8 is extremely helpful with all the features it provides and while also looking really beautiful at the same time. with its snapdragon 835 processor it allows the phone to run appropriately fast, and allows the user to be able to run most programs that couldn't be run on previous generations. with that and the four gigabytes of ram the new samsung galaxy s8 allows for two windows to be up on the same time; this allows for great multitasking. even though the internals of the s8 are powerful, the externals are just as good or even better. the galaxy s8 is by far one of the sleekest phones out there with its infinity screen and beveled edge. the screen it has gives it more real estate which allows it to give a nice wide angle view and look amazing on most applications. while the beveled double edge looks really nice it also is a very useful addition because it gives you the option for an incognito quick menu.this menu has an ever growing amount of possibilities; because it holds more than your top 5 contacts and your top 10 apps. there is a whole selection of extra pages for your bar ranging from far more than a notepad or a full on calculator which can come in handy for real quick math in the samsung app store. the galaxy s8 has one of the best battery lives, for it can last nearly a whole day on a full charge with general use. it also is very durable even though the whole body is made of glass it can sure take a massive beating as well as its water resistant. the s8 has so many features that its hard to mention them all but it is one of the best, if not the best, phone out on the market right now.
this phone is reliable.. but that's all i like about it.  it's smooth, slippery, glass front and back, and is quite possibly the most fragile thing i've ever touched. if you frequently venture far from the safety of your bed, or someplace afflicted by the ravages of gravity, this device is the wrong choice.
it's the phone that phone repair stores love!i've owned cell phones since 1995.  before i bought the s8, i had broken exactly zero screens.  in the year that i've had the s8, i have broken the screen three times, and the glass back once.  no case can protect it sufficiently, although to be fair i have not yet tried a foam-padded aluminum briefcase handcuffed to my wrist.if you live in an area that has gravity, i strongly recommend that you select a different device.
the screen literally cracks so easily.
the phone itself is fine. the form factor is in line with most modern phones. the biggest issue with samsung's phone is their software. incredibly slow update times to the latest operating system, resulting in users dealing with a sluggish user experience since they're using an older operating system.you can do better at this price point. just go buy a one plus if you want cheaper or google pixel for better updates.
not happy with this phone. the incoming/outgoing calls have issues. any call after 2 mins the audio is gone. the other person cannot hear me but i can hear them. please do not buy this version of the phone. waste of money. googled and found that there are lot of people going thru this issue without  a fix. need to call amazon about returning.
0 stars. this is the rube goldberg of cell phones. idk who is giving this phone more than 1 star other than because you have to give at least one. everything wrong with this phone in a nutshell- bixby button, misplaced fingerprint scanner, misplaced speaker, annoying side tab on edge of screen- oh and it's really expensive. i promise you will not like this phone- unless you drive slow in the passing lane.
excellent all around. customizableusb c port broke within months. can only wirelessly charge now.
great phone but has few cons comes with it. it gets scratch  very easy; from front to back. so get a screen protector  and  a case *asap* if not you will regret it. i sure did.
i liked the last version of this phone better. the s8 is glitchy. bixby is annoying. the autocorrect seems dumber than the old ai. the curved edges mess with the touch screen. the camera is a little better, but it doesn't make up for the overall poor performance. not impressed at all.
earlier this year someone made fun of my old s3. i guess that was sticking around in my head because inexplicably i bought an s8 during the prime day sale. after having the phone for a while i'm ready to say a few things about it.are any of the flagship phones worth the price?no.no phone is worth this price. for the cost of the s8 i could have replaced my aging laptop.is this a nice phone? sure. the screen seems to gather fingerprints more than my old s3, but aside from that i don't have any complaints off the top of my head. the major problem i've already stated. the value of a flag ship phone is far below the retail price. don't be like me. if you're not actually in high school you're fast running out of excuses for succumbing to peer pressure. none of us need $500-700 phones and there's plenty of other crap to be spending our money on.
exactly as described.  using it for quite a while.  no problem at all.  good phone at a good price.  very happy
works perfectly.  just plop in your carrier sim card and works great, and you don't get all of those forced app downloads that take up your memory.
sadly, this is one of the worst smartphones i ever owned. i am especially disappointed with the camera which is atrocious. all pictures and video are so noisy and low quality is ridiculous. for a phone this price it's unacceptable. i owned a galaxy s5 previously, and its camera is so superior to the one on this phone.
had the phone for a year now, no issues. was able to choose verizon on straight talk.
i am going to review what i consider the most important features of a phone.screen (5/5): literally, the most beautiful display i have ever seen. at first, i wasn't sure how the whole curved screen thing was going to play out but after just one day with it i was already questioning if i could ever go back to a normal flat screen. it's awesome.battery (5/5): i put this thing through its paces. the first few days i used youtube a ton and played a bunch of games to get a feel for how fast the battery drains. to make it short and to the point, you could obviously drain the whole battery if you turned the brightness to max and just played graphics intensive games for hours, but if we're talking about moderate to heavy use for the average adult then this thing will last all day without even making it to critical levels. i think the lowest i've seven seen the battery after a normal day's use (lots of texting, some phone calls, a few games and some youtube videos) is like 40%.storage (5/5): pretty simple to review this. 64gb is probably enough for most people, and even if it's not you can insert a microsd card.call clarity (4/5): at first, i didn't realize i had the hd calling feature on. this made the caller's voice seem super digital and weird, i didn't like it. after i switched it off, it improved the quality but it wasn't the best i've heard. by no means is it bad, just not the best,feel (4/5): it's a long phone, so if you have small hands you might want to play around with it a little before buying. i have large hands so it isn't as much of a problem for me, but i can see why this might become an issue for others.speaker quality (5/5): i was pleasantly surprised by the volume and quality of the speakers. don't get me wrong, they are cell phone speakers, but compared to other phones the s8's sound is above average.feel (5/5): this thing is sleek. i bought a minimalist case for it because i loved the way it felt in my hand. a few times, i had a moment of panic because i couldn't feel that it was still in my pocket. if you are prone to dropping your phone, i suggest getting a protection plan or a rugged case. i have not dropped mine yet, but i can easily imagine a single drop on a hard surface from waist level breaking the screen if it lands directly on it. the screen is supposedly pretty tough, but i wouldn't test it.if i think of more things to review i will update this, but for now i think that's all i have to say about the samsung s8. overall, i've never felt more impressed by a new phone
the screen on this phone gets horrible reviews and i wish we knew that before we got it. even with a good protective case it broke
hasnt infrared portthe screen is too long, but not so height
the phone itself is pretty good and have had the phone about a month ans i was in class and dropped it fell out od my pocket and the screen shattered. i have never had such a cheap screen. they want more than 500 dollars to replace it.
i do love the design of this phone nice and sleek easy to handle.  quick and has tons of memory witch is wonderful plus i added an extra storage on top of that.  the camera is the best yet so clear and captures the true light and colors, my family are iphone lovers however this one had made a few of them switch up.  one of the fastest running phones i've owned yet absolutely in love with this
everything works out for this phone.but if you are looking for carrier features like hd voice quality, video calling and wifi calling, this is not a device for you. no unlocked phone will support these features. so its a trade off between the carrier bloat ware and the carrier call features.but all in all this is one rock solid phone.
overall this is a really good phone. i actually like the fingerprint scanner location. the bixby button is extremely annoying and its the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5.
amazing. i never get the wireless charger but the phone and the oculus are great. the best phone is no doubt.
one of the phone was missing the earphones and the charger broken and scratched all over the other perfect condition
good phone
good good good
not a good choice. should have paid the money from verizon. emails, calls, messages take days to get and i live in the city. no notification for voicemail built in. would not buy again.
still loving it!
the king is here. prepare your ass- be whooped, apple!
look out for the guarantee when it is an international version because if something goes wrong you have to track down the manufacturer in whatever country it could be to see if he takes the repair. in my case i bought an international version in the us and amazon would not take responsibility for the malfunction, nor the seller because it appeared a few weeks after the purchase, and nor samsung usa because it was not manufactured in the usa. i has to track down myself the manufacturer who happened to be in east asia. i had to shipped them my phone with no guarantee which i finally decidad not to do. i an stuck with a phone that does everything ok except the talking function in a phone call.kind regards
scratches easily
battery sucks, you have to turn on the battery saver to survive a day. 'ok google' not working in this phone. bixby is worst
amazing phone.  looks so good and functionality is seamless
love it ! !
love the phone,deviled fast  just love it
nice improvement over s7
cannot stand this phone.  round edges are sleek but not user friendly;  hard to tap on apps when the tap is on the curve of the phone.  connectivity seems to be not as good as what i had with s6 which seems to be a verizon problem in general these days.  also, the slide answer button on the phone for incoming calls sometimes fails to slide and connect????  look elsewhere, this is not your latest greatest of smart phones.
i love it <3
we ordered a samsung galaxy s8+, and it was to take it as a gift in madagascar. the person opened it and realized that its a samsung s8 and not a + while we paid full price for it.
perfect phone for the budget price
the best phone ive owned
i am disappointed with this purchase.  at&t is my service provider and i have limited cell phone service at home.  someone suggested turning on wifi calling to improve cell service.  i did not find the wifi calling option on this unlocked cell phone.  i went into at&t store and was advised that since i did not purchase the phone from at&t, some features such as wifi calling would not be available.  very disappointed that unlock phone does not have same features at&t/carrier purchased phone.
i bought my samsung s8+ and had it unlocked. oh my!! this was the best phone i have ever purchased!! everything runs smooth and it has a decent battery life. all in all samsung you did a great job and this phone is def worth the investment.
great phone.  many upgrades from my previous phone!
well of course it's awesome, it's a galaxy s8 !great phone , had no problems getting it hooked up with at&t.
this phone is a beast!
i did not buy through amazon, but this is by far the most reliable phone on the market.
love my phone thru verizon
came quickly and works great.  exactly as advertised
1 month into using this phone it stopped working on its own.
great looking phone but not a good daily driver.  very slippery and edge to edge screen too prone to accident touching.  i keep tapping on the phone icon by accident while holding the phone.  bezels being too thin here really is problematic.  apple has much better accident touch detection.a case can help with the issue but can't fix the really weak battery life.  typical daily use, i am down to 54% by noon time.  requires charging, luckily there is fast charging.  they should include a bigger battery not smaller.the new touch screen home button is very confusing and awkward to use.  i have used pixel, nexus 6p, this new home button mimicks a physical one but performs very slowly in responsiveness.  you really have ""find"" the home button.  it doesn't just press anywhere on the bottom to activate it.the screen also seems to lag behind s7 edge in responsiveness.this is not a good phone for pokemon go at all.  the battery life sucks and the phone isn't much faster than s7 edge.plus side camera and screen quality is great but not a huge leap over the s7 edge.
i want a sample or trial period for this item
would probably be a good phone if not for the super annoying bixby app that you cannot turn off.
first foray into android and got it to go with a samsung gear s3 smartwatch.  i'm very happy with both.
assigned this as a work phone.  i am already seeking to buy my own phone and move the sim as i type this.  who thought beveled edges were a good idea?
it's amazing this phone
cheap phone that breaks easily.
phone keeps losing internet connection requiring me to go to t-mobile to reset it
this phone is ok. the infinity display is ridiculous.  no case will protect it from drops. had and s5 for years until it was stolen. no problems with mild drops.  put an otter box on this s8 plus and have had it for a month, broken screen. extremely short drop and if the retarded screen wasn't sticking out, nothing would be broke. brilliant idea samsung.  what is the point of this? anyone know? maybe to sell more screens?
my first new phone had pink line within first 30 days, then they replaced my phone andbattery dies within half day and again they replaced my phone andnow it does not turn on/off on very first day.waste of money & not a good quality product.
do not purchase this phone. this phone calls people in my contact list all day. this phone opens applications all day. can't  turn off bixby which is calling and opening apps indiscriminately and samsung says that there is no way to disable or turn off the very sensitive bixby button.  there is no bixby application button  to open  bixby if you could turn off very sensitive bixby button.  butt dialing or pocket dialing is the issue, sensitive home button that opens the phone when it's locked, sensitive bixby button that opens the phone when locked, camera on the lock screen opens the camera and starts taking pictures. when holding the phone applications near the edge of the screen and your hand open.
if you like putting your super slim technological wonder into some mammoth case then you'll be fine. otherwise buy insurance or prepare to replace a lot of screens.
everything that samsung makes is crap.to make it worse, they have the worst customer service and a warranty process that is intentionally designed to make 75% of legitimate claimants give up. that’s a fact, look it up. 3 of 4 people that bought a crappy samsung product and try to get samsung to stand behind their product, give up because the process is more of a headache than it’s worth.buy your goods from companies that stand behind their products and actually want to make quality products and stay true to their word.
i love the galaxies, now i want to buy both 8+ and 8 but i don't want the dual sim cos that's what we have in nigeria.  though i want to use them in nigeria.
i was enticed by samsung's $200 trade in program. sent them my perfectly working iphone 5s. but samsung charged me $175 to my card and mentioned that my phone does not qualify for the $200 rebate program. this is a bait and switch program by samsung. there is no explanation why my good working iphone 5s did not qualify for trade in program.be aware of this samsung's trade in program! they are fraudulently charging credit cards based on this trade in program.
abs garbage. yeah pictures are great and all but i've dumped over $1300 into screen replacements and new batteries. unless you have money don't buy this phone.
get bixby off of the phone
does not work! no caller id all phone calls show up as unavailable, no voicemail or texting of pictures. carrier says it is a defective phone and something to do with the way it is unlocked.
very dissapointed that this phone broke  inside and out after a very minor drop not even five days after recieving it .will no longer buy samsung products . it is very fragile to be so exspensive whats the point of it being waterproof if it so easily breaks on dry land . thats  only help to a fish which i am not . will be using apple products from now on .
a 600 dollar pile of whale terd! anything is better than this junk.
i never had this phone but my dad has on it when he told me about this phone and when i see that was extraordinary phone also this phone comes by different ways.
samsung devices are terrible and poorly made.
i don't know this version doesn't support arabic interface and middle east countries, so bad
have only had it for 5 days and the screen has scratches all over
this phone sucks
after 10 years with apple, bye bye apple i'm done. after holding this phone you realize apple had stopped innovating. this is by far the most beautiful, sleek fluid thin light weight designed phone ever to be offered. the infinity screen is stunning to the human eyes, the speed of the processor is just amazing.
beware!99% of the negative reviews are seller reviews! people bought used products or from a private seller and got something not covered by amazon. buy new, from amazon. if you don't know how to shop, i suggest you double check where the item is coming from in your cart and before you check out. pay attention!after owning the phone long enough to be familiar with it, i thought i would leave a decent review outlining some of the pro's and con's, as well as some neutral's. my review is as follows: (see end comments about unlocked and verizon use - this phone is 100% unlocked!)pro's:1. very sleek design. very nice screen and overall a great phone.2. the camera/video recorder is amazing. simple as that. i took amazing outdoor and indoor (even in low light/no light) pictures. i am genuinely impressed and was not expecting it to be so good. (see last pic. photo on phone was taken by s8)3. the pixel ratio/screen size. i got the s8 because i did not want a huge computer in my pocket, and it has plenty of room in it.4. very fast. the processor even with battery settings set to a mid level (which can be changed to your personal preference) is still fast enough to do anything you can throw at it.5. ram and storage ration. perfect. plenty of ram to handle multi-tasking and plenty of storage to handle those 4k videos/pictures plus room to expand with sd storage, which is also getting much better and bigger. but 64gb entry level... eat your heart out apple.6. great speaker! i mean wow... this thing get's loud. i was also not expecting such great sound. you will have no trouble hearing anything even in a loud environment. seriously amazed here.7. power saving/battery life. simply put, the amoled allows for some amazing battery life and the 3000mah batter holds up well. very well. much better than the iphone.8. fast charging. the lowest i have had the battery is about 60% and it charged in under an hour.9. amoled screen. as stated in #7, it helps with battery life but other than that, it has plenty of brightness and picture clarity. i also carified in #3 that the screen size and pixel ratio were simply stunning. you will notice this if you game alot or during those 4k picture zooms and probably much more on the s8+.10. accessories and headphone jack. it has a headphone jack! lol. the accessories that came with the phone are great. a fast charging cable, a type-c to mini usb extension, and a usb to type-c extension as well. the headphones are simply amazing too. by far some of the best i have owned, as far as ear buds go, and you don't have to pay for good quality here. the material of them is great and they come with extra different size earbuds.11. water resistance. while i have not tested it, and probably never will, it's a great feature. i still don't recommend dunking your phone.12. pocket settings. there is an option to keep the screen off while in your pocket, or something like a purse. simple as that. if you butt dial, you probably are not navigating the settings well enough. keep in mind, android has a lot of settings, and it would be wise to go through them all including the basic options that samsung offers.13. widget size. you can actually adjust the size of every single widget, and fit more apps on the pages as well as the default home row. you can also change the lock screen apps, if you want any at all. i personally have a camera and the phone app on the lock screen, and keep all my apps on a single page, in folders, the weather, a google search bar with the mic button, and lastly a control panel for quick access to bluetooth and auto-sync buttons etc etc.. all on one page, with plenty of empty space. half the screen is even still empty. thank you so much for resizeable widgets.neutral:1. bixby button. the button is below the volume buttons, so nothing you can do there. however, you can disable bixby. most reviews on here are failing to realize this and also failing to outline how. see the end of my review for simple instructions.2. phone length. i'll admit, it's pretty long. maybe i am just to used to an older, smaller phone, but one handed operations is going to take some getting used to. be mindful of the edges of the screen too. too much palm and you will be scrolling. i do not see this as a negative still, just takes some getting used to and as outlined in the pro's section, the overall screen size is perfect.3. edge lighting. a bit torn on this one. it seems cool, but is pretty much useless. it's basically a notification before the notification. so you would have to tap twice and then unlock as well. imho, it does look really cool, but samsung needs to give us more control over it.4. always on display. this can also be turned off. i find it 100% useless, but not a negative by any means. i feel it can definitely cater to some users who enjoy always being able to look at their phone. i personally disabled it and honestly looked no further into it.5. color settings. i have always disliked samsung's default colors. especially on tv's. however, there is an option to change them to your liking. i chose the basic setting, but there is even an option to change balance which let's you arrange a set of liked color boxes, whites, and blacks to your liking and all kinds of other options for personal preference. it really is a great setting, however, it is a neutral and not a pro simply because they enable a very rich color by default. so i recommend changing this to suite your own eyeballs.6. the lock screen clock/theme settings. in order to change the lock screen clock, you have to register with samsung themes and install a theme, which can be somewhat custom. i did this, and the deactivated my account. the setting were retained and all is well. still a neutral because i feel samsung should incorporate a way to change the lock screen clock by default to a couple preset clocks. the standard one imho, is ugly and not aesthetically pleasing to read.con's:1. typical android settings. everything is always on. this is not a samsung issue, but android. i recommend going through every single option, and every single app to change every single setting. sometimes, this can take the first week of owning an android phone to get right. this also almost always has a huge impact on battery life. there are settings in sub-menu's of settings. so please, navigate your android settings! your poor battery life is not due to this phone at all. it is due to negligence and laziness.2. ""ok google"". this seems to always be on, even when turned off in googles settings. i have a search bar and i have turned off all settings both in the phone and google, but for some reason if you say those two naughty words, it still comes up. however, if you do not set it up, it will only be asking you to set it up. same thing as bixby almost, but this is a negative because i do not want my mic on. at all. i think samsung needs to address this before anything else, even the bixby issues some people are not liking or failing to change.3. all glass. the phone is not strong by any means. it does not feel like a cheap pos, but it is all glass. this belongs in the negative because most of us are drop prone, and even if you are not, it is very easy to make a mistake. overall, it looks amazing, but there is no need for a glass backing too. i highly recommend you get a case, and if you are in fact drop prone, get a big durable case like an otterbox with a screen protector. the risk will always be there with all smart phones, but the s8 being all glass just seems pointless. that said, i have never dropped a phone to a point where it broke (fingers crossed, knock on wood).4. the finger print scanner. what a stupid placement for a finger print scanner. right next to the camera lense? come on... i personally do not use it at all, but if i did and wanted to take a picture, you would be cleaning your lense as soon as you unlocked it. nobody wants to take an unclear photo because they used the finger print security feature. i like the google plus one, but feel that if any, apple has the best one being in the home button.on a side note: this phone is unlocked. it can be used with any carrier. if you do not pay attention to who or where you buy it from, at least leave a sellers review instead of a product review. 99% of the negative reviews are this. please pay attention and buy a new phone from amazon only. i do not ever recommend getting a refurb on this kind of product, or buying from a private seller regardless of their rating. you just never know.as for bixby, all you have to do is not set it up and hold the home screen like you are adding a widget, scroll to the left and hit the button to turn it off. this will not remove it, but will stop it from doind whatever crazy stuff these other reviews are talking about. i have had no issues with bixby, because i turned it off. also, make sure you go through your settings, including the subsettings imbedded into android like background data usage etc etc and turn it all off. people having battery issues, i guarantee it is not the s8's fault. it is android and you would not get any better life with ios for failing to go through your settings. go through your settings! every. single. one. over and over for a week until you find every nook and cranny. there is a lot!overall, this phone is amazing. the list of pro's, con's, and neutral's are simply my take and my opinion. i do recommend the phone. at least if you are in a position to think about it and can try it, go to a local store and pick one up on the display to play with it, but it's just not the same as owning it. i was torn between a google pixel xl and this one, but when this dropped in price it made my decision that much easier. i did like the idea of a bigger phone, however, i just kept thinking how big it would be in my pocket. so i went with the standard s8 and i am very happy i did. i do a lot of fishing, hiking, and outdoor stuff and 90% of the time, i try to keep my phone around me in my pocket in case of an emergency. usually off, because where i go there is no signal anyways.any review stating a mostly negative opinion, in my opinion, is probably a bit trollish or did not do any research and made an impulse buy. i think you can get used to this phone and if you are complaining about the things i have outlined here, the only one to blame is you. so give it a try, navigate all the settings, get used to android, and don't drop this phone lol! thank you for reading.
do not buy from a)ma)zon warehouse. i am sure this phone is great, but the one i received was missing the sim card cover and conductor plate, and no earphone. so, sad to say, christmas is ruined by a)ma)zon warehouse. wish i had this phone in actual working order. not even sure if this review will go through, a)ma)zon cancelled my previous review of this product.
i haven't owned a galaxy phone since the galaxy nexus.i've always felt that samsung's touch wiz ui was too gimmicky and looked cartoon-ish.this is my 5th phone in the last 6 months. i was coming from a nexus 6p, one plus 3t, axon 7 and lg v20.i really liked the lg v20 for it's cameras and the axon 7 for it's front facing speakers. the 6p and one plus 3twere so smooth. but i decided to trade it all in for the s8.i was initially going to get a google pixel, but prices were still high and besides the camera, not much appealed to me.the s8 is a damn sexy phone with over 80% of the front being the screen. i like the size. fits perfectly in my hands.i don't think i will go back to a 6"" phablet phone. the screen is vibrant. the clear flip cover case works well with it too.touch wiz has been toned down from what i remember, but there is still a lot of bloatware, which i quickly disabled.i guess i like all the screen shot options this phone has to offer. you take screen shot many ways, annotate, make gifs, etc.charging is pretty fast and the battery lasts me all day. the included headphones are really good. can't go wrong with akg. they look cheap, but they sound superb. i'm using face unlock, it's really fast. i have my finger print set up too, but face unlock is faster and more convenient. i guess someone can always hold up a picture right? (haven't tried it yet) the finger print sensor takes a little bit to get used to. my finger naturally goes to the where the camera is located and you need to fully press on the sensor to get it to unlock.they should move the camera to the corner like some phones.usb-c is awesome.bluethooth 5 is awesome. you can now stream to 2 separate bluetooth speakers at the same time (one will have a slight delay though).i have a few gripes.even though it has a f1.7 aperture the camera is not wide angle. it does take really good pictures and videos.my other gripe is the single speaker. c'mon... it's 2017.... all flagship phones should have stereo speakers.get rid of bixby. let us just use google assist.by default the phone display is set to 2220x1080, which is fine for me. you can always set it to wqhd (2960x1440). i'm not sure how much more battery the phone will be using if you did. i still like that samsung lets you put a sd card it it and it comes with a otg adapter so you can plug in other usb sticks too. the edge panel is just ok. still getting used to it. i can live without it.this phone has tons of other features too, but i'm not going to list them all. overall, it's the best smart phone i've ever owned. hopefully it holds up well over the next 2 years.
this phone is advertised as having a ""samsung us limited warranty"" and as ""new.."" oh really?i bought two of these phones on jan. 31. recently one of the phones developed occasional blackouts and poor energy consumption. i brought it to a samsung repair facility, which told me that the warranty expired in july 2018! i was shocked. i rushed home and called samsung, which confirmed that information. i then registered the phones on the samsung website, which again confirmed that these two ""new unlocked"" phones were in fact verizon phones, and that the warranty had expired on july 8, 2018 for both phones.i then brought the phone with the bad battery to the samsung-owned service facility on greenwich street in nyc, in the hope that maybe there was a mistake, but again it was confirmed that the phone was used and with an expired warranty.the phones were returned for a full refund. but getting that refund required repeated phone calls and an email exchange with the seller, during which he initially indicated that a refund was not possible because the 30 day period had lapsed. the whole experience was a stressful waste of time that flushed two days of my life down the toilet.the moral of the story is that you should always check the imei numbers before buying a cell phone online, including amazon. do so immediately.  better idea: do not buy cell phones online i got the same damn phoneas, brand new, from my celll phone carrier for fifty bucks more each.
after using an old phone with such a large bezel, the switch to the galaxy s8 was spectacular. i could not stop staring at the screen when i first saw it. there is just so much of it! after using this phone for a couple months, i have created a list of what i love the most and dislike the most of this product.pros:-screen has amazing brightness, resolution and size.-cameras are spectacular. images are sharp and crisp.-opposed to contrary belief, the fingerprint scanner on the back is easy to reach and is very responsive-battery life is very good, also charges very quickly with the included fast charger-has video enhancement and game enhancement modes for when you need extra brightness, performance and screen resolution.cons:-feels very delicate (easily solved with a case)-glass on the back so it is a fingerprint magnet (easily solved with a case)-bixby button can be confused as volume down button, also bixby software is not the best at the moment but it is a new product and has lots of potential.overall great phone and great experience so far. would recommend!
i have had my galaxy s8 for a little bit now and it has been great so far! i love how fast it is. i love the little things about it. the screen is absolutely phenomenal with the curve and screen to body ratio. the fingerprint scanner is great and i know majority don't like the position but for me it works amazing. it fits well in the hand and the cases feel just as nice. luckily i have not dropped it yet so i hope if i ever do that it withstands the drop that would most likely be out of my pocket or about chest height. switching from a galaxy s5 to this s8 was a big change for me and i am glad i made it. anyone who is thinking about getting this phone, i would say do it. it has everything you could want and more. i was torn between this and the pixel 2 and they both have almost the same internal hardware but this has a 3.5mm headphone jack. you can't beat that because most companies are now doing away with it. i love not being able to plug in a dongle if i want to quickly listen to music or watch a short video. honestly, i know i am bias towards samsung products but everything i have had and also my friends/family have are amazing. they made great phones and appliances. everything they make is top of the line and that's just the truth.
i was expecting something amazing after upgrading from my old note 4, and this falls short of my expectations. battery life is disappointing, even with most of the apps ""sleeping"". it's the one thing that needs to be addressed and fixed - a larger battery cell on a phone this big is probably something that most consumers would be ok with. i also don't really like the absence of a ""home"" button, and the bixby button on the left side of the phone is ridiculous. you think you're pressing the volume button, and instead you get the bixby screen pop up. i've yet to use it - google assistant works like a charm on this phone and wakes up with ""ok google"".on the plus side, this phone qualifies for sprint's 1 year free unlimited bring your own phone plan.
amazon was having a $200 off deal on this when i purchased, which... is really good for a new phone, actually. i moved to this from the s5, and it's a big change. overall this is very slick, fast, and high-performing. i like it much better than the s5--everything is faster and more responsive. the edgeless screen made me nervous at first, but the case i purchased seems to protect it okay. i've dropped it a couple times already from a distance of about 2-3 feet, face down and in its case, and it's been fine. if it breaks within a year, i'll update my review accordingly.my favorite feature is that its narrower--i like big phones, but i don't have big hands, so they can be exhausting to hold after a while. this one is just the right size to easily hold in one hand, while still having excellent screen real estate. it's not very heavy, which makes it easy to continuously read and interact on it one-handed, too, even with a heavier case.my least favorite feature is bixby--while it has its uses, it really isn't that great at interacting with apps or hearing commands properly. it won't open non-google apps on command, which is a huge pain, and half the time seems to mishear me even when i speak directly into the microphone and enunciate very clearly. right now i solely use it to turn off the always on display at night, which seems like a waste for what could otherwise be a very powerful tool. it's actually kind of bizarre that it's as bad as it is, considering how many voice-controlled devices are on the market right now.
screen is very easy to break. no case can protect the curved screen. do not buy.
i upgraded to this s8 from my s6 edge since i was getting fed up with the capped storage capacity at 64gb otherwise i probably would have waited another year or 2. (and sun spots which burned permanent purple dots on my front facing cam. . .)this phone has some upgrades which i personally enjoy:-battery capacity. holy cow. this thing actually lasts me over 10 hours of almost constant netflix streaming with brightness at 75% with bluetooth wireless earbuds and that only bring its to about 30-35% battery. it then still lasts the rest of the day at 25% brightness taking it down to just about 15% battery. (i normally start charging it up once it hits 20% though)-camera function: incredibly fast focus and quality. (only minor con is that it's not amazing in low light, using promode helps a bit though)-smooth touchscreen with a lot of customization features within the phone itself.-being an unlocked phone, minimal bloatware comes on the phone. (sadly there are some things...)-you can easily turn bixby off if you don't like it. (the camera item search/translator is pretty fun though!)-always on display is actually really helpful for me since i don't have to reach over to see the time if i randomly wake up in the middle of the night. i keep it simple without a background and just colorized text, so it doesn't seem to consume much battery even if it's. . . always on. (you can also set it up to show during certain hours in a day.)-it still allows your to insert microphone jacks.-usb-c, i personally like it since i dont have to worry about turning it around to fit anymore. (box also comes with some adapters.)-and obviously the miscrosd storage. stuck a 128gb card in there upon arrival.some downsides on the phone:-fully made of glass. it's not cheap feeling in the slightest, but it makes you a bit more paranoid if it does fall. (highly recommend a good case for this phone)-wish this came with a non-edge version. honestly don't enjoy it that much and causes issues with a lot of screen protectors, but i couldn't pass up the sale on the phone.-comes pre-installed with facebook. i don't use facebook so it's just an annoying app chilling on my phone which i'd rather have completely uninstalled instead of just disabled.-bixby button. . . well that thing is just kinda there. i don't hit it often but when i do it's just mildly inconvenient. thankfully my case has little ridges on the button which make it easier to locate the volume when needed. the button can become an issue on some phone stands though.this phone was able to hit all the things that i want in a phone: good camera, long battery life, adjustable storage, crisp display, and functional.all in all, i very much enjoy this phone with only minor gripes which aren't enough to make me dislike the phone at all.(yes, this phone works with most if not all carriers. that includes verizon. you can even see this written on samsung's fine print for the phone. you may need to have the sim card activated in another phone first then switch it into your s8.)
the galaxy s8 is a solid, quality phone based on my use of it over the past month+.  it was a welcome upgrade to my s5, which had become terribly buggy and crash-prone with the latest software updates.  i hesitated to give samsung another try after so many later problems with the s5.in the end it was worth the upgrade.  as expected, the s8 was fast and slick, although some of the standard apps suffer from usability changes for the worse, compared to the s5.  i have come to expect this with any major software/hardware upgrade so it's hardly worth mentioning.of note however, is the hoops i had to jump through to get this phone working with verizon.  this review has less to do with any issues with the phone itself (there have been almost none) and more to do with the general incompetence of the specific staff at my local verizon store.this unlocked 64gb phone is perfectly compatible with the verizon network and now is working great; however, the verizon store employees were unable to get my phone working out of the box because it was not a ""verizon branded"" s8.  do yourself a favor; call verizon tech support to get it figured out.  after almost a full day of fruitlessly working with the store employees and managers and being sent on one wild goose chase after another, a 15 minute call to verizon tech support resolved everything.note that this phone takes a mini sim card and can't simply be swapped from the s5; this is why i had to endure a trip to the local verizon store at all.also note; if activating this unlocked phone on verizon, they will not allow you to download or install their standard verizon voicemail app.  you will be required to download another voicemail app/service from the google app store.  not a big deal; youmail fits the bill just fine for me.other than those few minor bumps, it was much worth getting the unlocked s8 on amazon for hundreds less, without being stuffed to the gills with bloatware, compared to the verizon branded s8.
this phone should be a no-brainer. easily the most stunning display ever on a phone, great specs, samsung pay, expandable storage, and waterproofing should make this the best phone on the market. enter samsung's software. while touchwiz isn't nearly the raging dumpster fire it was back in the s4 and s5 days, there's still a lot of extras that most will consider junk. chief among these is bixby. have you ever wondered what siri would be like if it were dumber and had a dedicated hardware button? that's bixby. not content to let google do the heavy lifting, samsung's mo continues to be creating inferior versions of services already offered by big g. want to remap that button to something actually useful? too bad. samsung keeps patching the phone in order to force their bloatware down your throat. as it is, that's a dead button that you'll press once out of curiosity, and a few dozen times while trying to turn down the volume. one other annoyance of note is the horrible placement of the fingerprint scanner. there's just no excuse for this one.overall, it's a great phone that's held back by samsung's usual goofball decisions.
really bad service from samsung. the phone came with a defect in the front camera. i called them and they told me it will be fixed when the phone updates to the new version. i was back and forward with samsung since i notice the issue. i noted first when i made my first skype meeting call. then when my colleges told me about the issue, i started taking selfies, i notice that all the selfies have the same black spot in the same place. unfortunately, i figured out the issue 36 days after i bout this phone from amazon. so, i  could not return the phone due to the 30 days return policy.i contacted samsung, they asked me to update and reset the phone and so a bunch of staff to the camera app. after the 2nd call, they sent me to a repair center close to my home. the repair center wanted to charge me $109 dollars. i called samsung again. this time samsung told me that because i was under warranty they can fix it for me. they cannot replace phones but just fix them. samsung told me that they will take 11 days to fix it. i expressed my concern that i bought an expensive phone because the service as my work and my business depend on a reliable phone. i told them that i cannot afford 11 days without communication. so, they told me ""well you won't be without communication you can buy a ship phone and exchange the sim card until your phone cames back"".so, does not samsung understand that an unlock cheap phone cost at minimum 120 and it won't be able to multitask as fast i need to do my job and maintain my business?i do not recommend to buy this phone or any samsung phone if service and reliability is the most important subject for your purchase.
this is one of the coolest cells ever. i had no problem activating.  i read many reviews before buying it and was all prepared to go through the drama everyone said with activating.  first i connected to my wifi and transferred everything. which was simple. the phone walked me through connecting the sub and my old droid. the transfer took 1hr 17m. then i removed my sim card insert it. the phone detected it was a verizon sim and completed update. i was able to make a call immediately. the phone walks you through every feature and it is so simple. don't believe all the negative reviews. this phone is worth it.
this is quite a phone.it's extremely fast compared to our older samsung s4.it's unlocked, so even when the kind folks at verizon looked at me as if i was ignorant and gullible as they wondered out loud if the phone would work on the verizon network, i knew it would (having read the reviews at amazon) and i just told them to produce the free small sims card.  (sorry about the lost commission guys, not.)if one already has a samsung, it works in a similar fashion and a couple of days messing around with it is enough to gain a reasonably good working knowledge of the phone.  the samsung site is quite informative and i've referred to it several times already.one strange thing is what feels like dueling systems on the phone.  you have the google android apps and simillar samsung apps.  many do the same things so choosing one or the other is really personal preference.i can't get over how fast this phone surfs the internet (i use firefox) and how nicely photos are auto-arranged by date.
i waited until recently to purchase the s8+ as my original intention was to get the note 8 upon its release (after waiting a year after the aborted note 7). however, all things considered it was difficult to justify the price of the new note at almost $1,000 whereas the s8+ through amazon was markedly cheaper.so, the decision was made and i am very happy with the phone as i was in desperate need of an upgrade from my s4 model. i got the s8+ as i was keen to have a larger screen and this screen does the job - large enough to watch videos etc but not so big that it feels awkward.  i haven't spent much time using the camera yet but it is certainly better than my old phone but not sure if it stacks up against my wife's iphone.i am into the android ecosystem and the phone worked seamlessly with my gear watch out of the box.all told, i believe this phone is still state of the art and represents good value for money. i am not sure how much further mobile device manufacturers can go with new models at the $1,000 level but, imho, it makes sense to wait a while and purchase a slightly dated phone at a slightly discounted price as you still get lots of bang for your mobile buck!
pros:great phone in almost all regards.  my last one was a samsung s5.  this is noticeably faster to respond, and battery life is improved. it uses a usb-c connector, which i guess is the new standard, so i'm replacing all my cables.  (samsung's package includes a short usb-c cable and charger, plus a micro-usb to usb-c adapter.)nice display.  this is the standard s8, not the s8 plus, but this one is plenty big. warning:  it's all glass, so i strongly recommend buying a protective case.  i did.nice camera.cons:battery cannot be opened nor removed.phone does not have ""wi-fi calling"" (voice over wifi) feature.  most phones have had that for years, including my old samsung s5.  it may be up to the carrier to turn on that feature, and this phone came ""unlocked"" with no carrier.  i've contacted a couple people at at&t but they say ""it's just not on this phone,"" and of course they cannot fix the missing feature.
this camera has been reviewed about 18,000,000 times. if you're looking for some incredible insight or new understanding of how the samsung sa plus works, there are lots of phone reviews that will give you the incredibly detailed evaluationi got this as a replacement phone for a significant other. that person has one basic need. to send messages, to make calls, and to get a camera that can take good pictures. i have the exact same phone but i have the note 8. i think the note 8 is the absolute best phone i've ever had. i use the pen for taking notes and making quick reminders. i also use the pen to edit the pictures and i have multiple photo editing programs. they require a fine touch and my fat fingers don't work.if you don't need the pen, this is the same phone and does everything but does not have this slightly added size and slightly diminished battery that the note 8 has. apparently when they add the stylus they take a little bit away from the battery and add a little bit to the size and weight of the phone.android on this phone works great. yes it comes with tons of bloatware but it can be left alone or removed. bixby is a absolute pain and the bixby button is nothing but an annoyance. i downloaded an app that allowed it to be reprogrammed. unfortunately, samsung keeps updating the phone and seems to have an ulterior motive to remove the option of reprogramming the bixby button. fortunately, app developers are only one step behind and update the app the minute that samsung seems to interfere with the app function.in the last year i've used this type of phone it has a great screen, great processor, incredible touch, and the o led screen is awesome.i read a lot of reviews of people who broke their phone or commented that the touchscreen was diminished after they put a screen protector on. i've use this phone for a year without a screen protector. i understand the anger and hostility of people who broken their screen on a very expensive phone shortly after purchase. unfortunately, accidents happen and any phone can have a screen that breaks due to either clumsiness or inadvertent shock.and, putting a glass screen protector on the phone will diminish the touchscreen capability. i have not used a screen protector any year, carry it in my pocket and have zero scratches. take off your protector and enjoy the beauty of the phonein my experience, this phone is five stars. great gps, great google voice recognition, great screen, processor works and seems to be able to handle everything you throw at it.
everything was fine. i have been using last 4 months. but i did not used the head phone yet. today when i opened it, it was defected as the picture.
not as expected.very fragile.low battery life.screen is a joke, easily scratches/cracks.software issues.
the s8 is too small i like to return it and get the 8 plus is that possible
complete overrated junk like all new phones made to break and keep you brain dead. why do i hate this phone well let me see...lets start with its shuts of then never turns back on complete crash no reboot tricks nothing absolutely nothing for no reason other then to make you lose time and money on top of what they robbed you for the phone. if it i could do it all over id shove it up samsungs azz they cant do anything right setting homes and airplanes on fire for 800 bucks you get a hunk of useless plastic and painted glass. then when you call for help on your out of the box phone they pretend they dont know about a well known issue just to bust your balls a little more send it in and get back in 2 weeks? how about you send a new oine and i send you a 2500.00 bill for lost wage and customers. thankfully sprint crooks are sending a replacment because samsung doesnt stand by there junk products i wouldnt by a bouncy ball with samsungs name on it. im gonna sell this phone to some retard that thinks phones are a good investment and buy a cheap kyocera i had for 10 years not days. complete fail samsung youve cost me more then this phone was worth or atleast what stupid consumers agree to pay. junk...pound salt samsung as for all you fools run far away from this overrated turd of a phone.
garbage
never again samsung. if youre like me and read reviews maybe you feel bamboozled. who puts out a video prooving how shatterproof the screen is but is rated the poorest ever and easiest to break? i am pissed! even though you may love the phone, you wont love paying 200-500 for multiple screens. i may ship back to samsung and tell them to...
cracked way to easy
i've had it for a few months now and while i've gotten used to it, i can honestly say i don't like this phone.i'm always triggering bixby, which is annoying in itself, but add to it that it's a fairly useless feature and it becomes a lot worse.i'm not overly impressed by the camera, i came from a note 4 so i expected to be blown away.accessing camera settings is a pain and it seems there are fewer manual options than with the note 4 in terms of camera functionality - or maybe i just haven't figured it out yet, but even if that's the case, it's annoying.after the transfer, about a week in, a bunch of my pictures and contacts were gone and it seems the cloud had specifically ""chosen"" not to back those up as well.occasionally the maps vocal function doesn't work, i have yet to figure out why.the fingerprint function should be located better.now learning that droids were targeted with the most privacy issues... i don't know, i've been a pretty advid droid fan, but i certainly wouldn't recommend this one and i might turn away from the brand entirety.
this is a good phone with some major issues.first good:--very nice display and good sound--good camera, especially in low light.--looks really good.now to the bad:--some of the applications that used to run before without problems, now take huge resources and stop working, e.g. requires rebooting the phone every time i want to use amazon prime video.--display while good is fingerprint and dust magnet and all these things reflect in sunlight making viewing experience less than optimal, to put it mildly.--it may be t-mobile specific but data connection settings do not include both 4th and 6th standards for the network, so i had to create my own setting for it-- the biggest thing the phone front camera and back flash (as well as all camera software) stopped working after only two months. after analyzing the issue (samsung has internal hardware checking menu), i found out that it was hardware issue. it was confirmed and fixed by samsung center in manhattan (guys at ""samsung 837"" are great. if anyone lives in nyc metro area, you should visit samsung 837: great service, great experience and they do not try to sell, they just show the products and explain).
screen scratches so easily its a joke
upgraded phones with a new phone plan, and got a galaxy s8+.  regretted it immediately.  first issue - the curved screen means that holding the phone by one hand and typing is difficult as your hand keeps touching the edge of the screen and screwing up typing.  logged into google, and begin porting over my contacts.next problem - contacts show as synced, but several are missing.  as a test, i added a contact via google contact web interface (remember, the phone said it was already synced), and then kicked of another sync.  again, contact no-show.  mysteriously 2 hours later, contact showed up.final problem (and when i returned it and bought an iphone) - voice mail never worked.  i didn't bother trying to figure out why, i just returned the phone and upgraded to an iphone.
i have had my s8 purchased directly here through amazon for exactly one year last week. it has been great except for one big problem. about two months ago i saw a moisture warning stating ""check usb/charger port: moisture has been detected in your charger/usb port. make sure it's dry before charging your phone. it may take some time to dry completely"". initially the warning went away, but then it came back about a week later and has stayed lingering on my swipe screen and notifications area ever since. no amount of drying or cleaning the usb port fixes it. it wont let me charge the phone with the usb cable. there is a work-around, i can restart the phone and plug it in just as the restart screen appears, but this is a huge pita, especially if i am using the phone for gps and driving. so while i love all other aspects of the phone, this defective usb moisture sensor is ruining an otherwise excellent product. i have even tried putting it in my laboratory desiccator in case there was any trapped moisture, but not effect.
first let me get this out of the way: this phone for the most part is awesome. the specs are beastly, the camera is among the best in class, the 1440p bezel-less curved display looks amazing, and the features this phone has is vast and actually useful in everyday usage. but while this phone is objectively one of the best out right now, it is also one of the most fragile. the backglass on mine broke within a week of usage and i actually had to replace the backglass in order to fix this. to put it in context, the only other phone glass that i have ever broke is the ipod touch 4th gen, and i had that for nearly 2 years of usage before that happened. this is not a durable phone in the slightest, and i would highly recommend getting a case or skin for it if you plan to get this phone. outside of that, this is a great phone and i'd recommend it assuming you are cautious enough to avoid issues
i already have an s8 for personal phone so purchased a second one for my work phone.  this one came with t-mobile branded but just like my other one it changed to verizon as soon as i put in the sim.  i have had my personal phone almost 2 years and by far the best device i have every used.  battery life on it is amazing and of course i tweaked and removed many apps i will never use to help.this phone is just as awesome except the battery life.  after all day light use i am down to 25% with mid-level power savings implemented where as my other main phone is still 65% - 70% if no power savings profile. if i used it heavily i need to recharge at least once.  i have tweaked and changed everything but after doing my experiments there is definitely something different.  either i just have and exceptional battery in my 2 year old phone or the new one has some short comings.i am going to continue with the phone but i am guessing i will need to get the battery replaced sooner than i was expecting.  love everything else but that is very disappointing.
thanks to all who took their time in writing reviews on how to save money by purchasing an unlocked phone outside of our cell phone plan vendors. thank you! the phone was easily added to my existing verizon account saving $300 on the purchase price without paying a  ""$50 activation fee"". i actually took the phone to a verizon store and a very nice verizon employee did all the work, including adding a screen saver and otter box. hated my 7, which failed from day one. i love the 8 and loved losing all the verizon apps i never asked for or needed.
bought ""refurbished"" item from seller edge cellular.  received model sm-g950u1 factory unlocked phone.  came in generic box with just phone (in bubble wrap), white samsung charger and cord as the description said it would.  looked new, not used and works great so far.had old samsung galaxy core prime phone bought through verizon years ago that i uesd before this s8.  that one is verizon locked and takes a micro sim card.  went to verizon store, said i bought the phone online and needed a nano sim card since old one wouldn't fit, he went in back and got a sim card and put it in phone and got it working in about 5 min, no questions asked.  works perfectly.  couldn't be happier and at a great price.only drawback:  registered the phone on samsung website, says warranty expired little less than a month ago.
today my samsung s8 died. fine one minute, completely dead the next. i switched out from iphone and when it worked, i loved it. tried all the available salvage options, but no use,  it's completely unresponsive no matter what. 13 months of use - seems like a heavy price tag. hence the 1 star rating. samsung , please get your act together.
i was looking for a new android phone and it came down to this or the pixel 2. the pixel 2 doesn't have a headphone jack so i opted for the s8. this is a great phone! i'm sure there are more detailed reviews out there, but overall, i love this phone. smooth interface, beautiful form factor, headphone jack, no problems using all my apps. i like the unusual screen shape, which is a bit longer than typical, which means you get more screen space without having to deal with a super-wide phone. it does overheat more easily than my earlier nexus 5 (to be fair, i accidentally took it into a sauna so this is an unusual use case) and there are times when the touch screen isn't quite as responsive as i'd like, but it's a solid phone for the price. i've used multiple apps and functions, hooked it up to bluetooth speakers and headphones (regular and bluetooth), connected to multiple wifi ports, etc. and it's handled all of that pretty comfortably.it's slim and the screen is big so people recommend a case. i bought a super thin humixx case (red!) that i like, and no problems.
the phone functions quite well and it's performance is nice compared to older phones i've used in the past. still, the bixby feature is annoying and the edge screen makes it hard to type. the screen is also hard to protect because many tempered glass screen protectors don't adhere correctly to it. to make matters worse, the spigen case i bought doesn't seem to provide enough front facing protection. if i drop this thing on its face, its done.battery is acceptable and it runs most apps fairly quickly. i'm not too impressed with the camera, though it is an improvement over my nexus 6p.while i'm satisfied with it's performance, i'm a bit annoyed that such a best selling phone gets android updates quite late. it's not bad but far from breathtaking.
this phone is clearly new and is unlocked.seller shipped unit right away.the factory box had a nice presentation with phone all the cables/fobs/cords present.i have been using this phone for 3 days now and it is working out perfect.to ge my phone on straight talk  i went to their website and chatted with the rep.they sent me a sim card called:  ""verizon compatible"" product id ""tf256psimv9td""..when it arrived i chatted with rep again -but probably didn't need to do so -.they had me use their website and fill out the activation panels.basically giving the system the phones meid the  sim's serial and the money for 1 month service.with that task done, i inserted sim card into phone and booted it up.i was making calls, and sending texts (both sms and mms) without any issues or hassle.
while the phone itself runs smoothly and isn't drowned in bloatware, looks aesthetic, and is packed with one of the best cell phone cameras i have ever handled, it only took a slide off my bed in order to crack the screen. unfortunately, the screen on this phone just croaked, rendering it useless, and getting a replacement display will not be cheap.another thing to note was that the end curvature of the display could be a nuisance, as my hand would wrap around the phone and inadvertently activate the side panel among other things.
had it for 10months now, price has dropped by about 90 bucks since then.supposedly made out of ""gorilla glass"" , sounds tough right? well it didn't survive a drop from my hands onto a concrete floor, it's now cracked badly with chunks chipping off of the corners.  they should call it extra-brittle baby monkey glass and not give the material a tough name, because it isn't tough.the worst problem is that the phone has never been improperly exposed to moisture yet it now constantly refuses to charge and claims that it has ""detected moisture in the charging port"".  this is with oem chargers and cords as well as aftermarket stuff.  i'm stuck trying to reboot the phone all the time to get it to stop complaining and refusing to charge.  sometimes it will decide the phone is wet mid-charge and i go to pull it off the charger and it has fully discharged when i am expecting it to be full.it has been telling me software updates are available, hmm maybe there is a fix for the incorrect ""wet usb port"" message i have been getting.  well i don't know because it will only allow me to download the update over wifi, despite having an unlimited data connection that i use for 100% of my web use.  i took it with me to the gym and used their wifi to download the update and it installs.  then it says there is another after i leave , so i use the grocery store wifi and it updates again.  then it says there is another so i go to a book store and it says it is fully up to date.  then i leave and it renegs and says it needs to download another 1.5gig update...  guess what, i don't have wifi because i use my phone to tether for web browsing.  and i'm tired of driving around bumming wifi, this is unacceptable when every other app can download or update with my 4g data connection.the specs are good and the screen gives a nice image.  i like that this phone still has an sd card port, i wish they still came with a removable battery like older models. however just like any other android phone i have had,  when i use it on roadtrips with a navigation app and pandora playing, one or both of the apps will eventually stop responding and the phone can get pretty warm while plugged in running that stuff for hours.  this isn't necessarily samsung's fault, could be the apps. anyway it often times requires a reboot to get everything running again which is very distracting and not appreciated while rolling down the highway.  also can really hose you when the nav freezes up just before you need to navigate a complicated interchange.the screen / digitizer replacement is still very expensive, and i don't know if i want to wrap up any more money on this thing because it has a charging problem.  would not buy again, which is pretty lame because i have had better luck with the non premium galaxy phones in the past.
overall it a great phone. but you don't see any performance improvement compared to snapdragon 820 processor based phones.always check the seller before placing the order.pros:sleek, beautiful phone.great camera, screen, battery life and call quality.cons:i am not getting any notification in my fitbit charge 2 even after enabling all available permission for the app / phone factory reset. i think samsung want to promote their wearables. i can give 5 stars if samsung fix this issue.full glass body. handle carefully.lot of bloatwares with the phone. but you can disable the apps.awkward position of fingerprint reader.
** i've decided to update my original review as a year has almost passed. **after following with the apple fan boy of owning an iphone, i decided to make the switch to galaxy as it was cheaper than the iphone x and i could always expand the storage as needed. insert a 128 gb microsd card into the phone and i have enough storage for photos, apps, and the likes in addition to the 64 gb of storage the phone already came with. what i don't like when i had an iphone was that apple tends to make old device obsolete, slow, or both when a new product comes out. my galaxy s8 hasn't slowed down one bit or suffer any problems. this is my second phone that i own that supports quick charge (after the s7). i love how i can just leave it on a wireless charging pad and check on it a couple hours later to see it fully charged.mind you that not all cases can allow quick charge. my wallet style case, for example, has to empty the cards before i can charge it (which is a minor issue). phone doesn't have a single scratch on it and i'm pretty rough with the phone when at work.
this is a sharp looking phone. it is the only phone i have ever owned, including the previous galaxies where people have inquired about it because of it's looks. the fingerprint sensor works really well for me and the face recognition is very convenient. my main downside is the software, which might be on samsung or might be on android. specifically, the unlock screen can preview your message as a notification. however, anyone can see this if they look at your lock screen and there is only a notification on or off feature and no way i know to leave the notification on without a preview being displayed. the other issue i have is that there is no quick toggle button for gps. you have to go into settings and flick it on and off there. one excellent feature is it remembered my wifi networks and their passwords which was always a pain when getting a new phone previously. not sure if this is a google account feature but kudos to whomever.camera: excellentbattery: so far, excellent. i don't use my phone like crazy but without any battery saving mode i still have at least 30% left at the end of the day.screen:  really, really fantastic, though due to its wrap around nature terrifying if you drop your phone and i don't like casessize: i don't like big phones but this one is okay-ishfeel: just great and not cheapheadphone jack: no idea why it is on the bottom and i think it is awkward if you are using corded headphones to make calls because it changes the orientation, buttons on bottom.tray sd: not a fan of this tray crap. worried about getting it jammed and placing the card correctly. the old system was much better.bixy button: don't use it, no idea but it is annoying if you don't use italways on display: pretty nice but not necessaryled indicator: the best feature and probably one of the only reasons i am brand loyal
honestly, samsung really hit it big with this one. although i'm sure the note 8 is even more impressive, i've found perfection in the s8. super fast processor, radiant screen that takes up the entire phone, amazing specs and of course the design was well thought through. i'm living it. i won't be buying the s9 because i'll wait till something surpasses this by a mile!!
first off, i bought this phone with my own hard earned money and bought it through amazon.  this is not a sponsored review.i've had samsung note phones because i like the big screens.  my old note 3 (which i loved) starting having problems with wifi and gps reception.  so i started looking for replacement phones and found this one.my carrier is verizon. you have to go into the verizon store with your old phones sim card so they can burn you a new sim card.  i was expecting to get a hard time from the store and was surprised at how nice the experience was!  they took my old sim, created a new sim in about 5 minutes with no charge!  very nice.and now on to the phone.  so i was loving my old note 3 and didn't really expect to have that much of a better experience.. wow was i wrong.so this is not a comprehensive review , just some of my observations and things that i really liked about this phone.  also, bear in mind i've been using older samsung note phones for the past 5 years.  so all the tech upgrades are fun.- the screen:almost as wide as the 5.7"" screen on my old note 3 but is taller.  so text is almost as large but with more space for content.  of course, resolution is amazing, colors pop and this thing gets really really bright.  the first time i used it in full sunlight i was amazed!  i could actually see text perfectly in full sunlight.  wow... what an improvement over my old phone.  i was also worried about the curved sides of the screen distorting text and pictures and such.  no problem at all.  i still feel the curved edges are a bit of a gimmick but it does not detract from the usability of the phone.  and no i don't care about any of the edge menus and  stuff like that.- the cpu / speedi thought my old note 3 was fast.  this thing is blazing fast.  i mean, everything you do is almost instantaneous.  now i'm spoiled and expect everything to pop up instantly.- the camerai've got it set up so that if you press the power button twice the camera comes up.  it comes up instantly.  you can take a photo immediately.  then you can take at least 1 photo a second.  the photos look great.- the speakerit's mono and on the bottom of the phone.  at least 50% louder than the speaker on my old note 3, at that was loud.  i'm so happy with the speaker on this phone, i can listen to podcasts when i'm in the kitchen.  i just pop the phone on the granite counter and crank the volume and i don't need an external speaker like on my old phone.  again, i'm pleased and surprised.  phone calls on the speaker are loud and clear.- the fingerprint reader.wow... it's instantaneous.  seriously.  you place your finger on the sensor and it's on in less than a second.  so easy.- weight and size.it's taller than my old note 3 but lighter and slimmer.  still fits in my back or front pocket fine.  i've got it in a case with a pop socket in the back.  drilled a hole in the case so that the pop socket is attached to the back glass on the phone.  so the pop socket is secured to the phone, acts as a handle and a mini stand when i place it on a counter to watch a video.- wireless charging.picked up a $15 wireless charger from amazon.  very nice.  i just lay it on the charger when i go to sleep.  super convenient.- sd card capable.took my old 64 gig sd card from my note 3 and popped it into this one.  nice, all my books and videos, photos and tunes came along for the ride.so anyway... i'm really glad i bought this phone.  no regrets at all.  i really don't have any cons.  i just dig it.very nice upgrade from my note 3.  highly recommended.
i'm typically a nexus/pixel phone user.  i got this phone as a replacement after my last phone didn't even last past 6 months.  so far it's fine.  there was a bit of a learning curve for me even though it's still android.  there are a bunch of apps preloaded from samsung that i will never use and i'm not really a fan of the curved edge screen.  i'm constantly accidentally hitting the sides while just holding the phone and it will either swipe to a different screen or open an app i didn't mean to open.  however, the screen is very responsive which is (usually) a good thing.  the ""ok google"" voice assistant doesn't work as well as it did with my google phones and i find bixby to be terrible so i've disabled that.  the sound quality is great - actually better compared to my old pixel.  i do wish this phone was slightly smaller.  i have small hands and it's really cumbersome to hold this.
i use tracfone, and was hesitant to buy something so expensive without an ironclad guarantee that this unlocked phone would work.  you have to buy the tracfone bring your own phone sim activation kit (i got this one: https://www.amazon.com/dp/b0713wh1y9/ref=twister_b071g7mdjy?_encoding=utf8&psc=1)  others before me have written detailed awesome reviews.  i just wanted to put my two cents in that if you use tracfone, this phone will work for you.
was reluctant at first but this has proved to be one of my smartest tech purchases this year! bought used for under $430 from amazon warehouse vs the over $800 new price tag from my carrier verizon (even though this model is 1 gen older than newest galaxy model). description said repackaged but nothing else about wear and tear. be careful since some items may have slight damage, every listed used product comes with a pretty accurate description of physical wear so pay attention! plus buy only through amazon, even their warehouse used items comes with same great return policy and exchange in case something goes wrong.my phone arrived timely and came repackaged with all accessories. looks and feels completely brand new! have been using it all week and it has been working fantastic! took 10-15 mins to figure out how to transfer service from my old lg phone to this s8 and works flawlessly on my verizon.was even able to register warranty on samsung's official site until next year. great deal and saved me over $400 from buying new from my phone carrier. thanks amazon warehouse!
so i've owned a pixil for a couple of years and then put it the washing machine.  oops. i initially bought the s8, having visited a phone store and really liked the display. it's quite vibrant. however, in accustoming myself to the phone i had problems with ""hi, bixby"". bixby is a 2nd ai on the phone designed to work and perform phone tasks. the 1st ai is ""ok, google"". one phone, two ai's and i never found out if they talk to each other. there are 10 levels to hi, bixby and i never got past level 3. another problem was the news feed (which will probably not bother others as it did me) but every headline in the news feed was on top of a photo, so i had to process a picture as well as read a headline printed over variable colors. add to that, instead of the feed being one box over another box it is in a hop-scotch format: one box over two side-by-side boxes over one box over two side-by-side boxes over....so my eyes have to jump all over the place to read a headline. too much effort was required by me to read a line. the last problem i couldn't get over was the alarm volume. can't get to the volume slide without setting an alarm to go off. the slide does not show up in the drop down menu for volume control. nowhere could i find it in settings. and for the two daily alarms i have, lowering the volume doesn't remain low. it always went back to a default level. so i have returned this phone and got another pixil.
i purchased this phone as an upgrade for my htc m9 that was getting long in the tooth and wasn’t a good value as a trade in. i was going to go for a hauwei mate se,  but research showed that it may not be a good match for my samsung gear s3 running samsung tizen software. since i'm accustomed to the watch which played well with the m9, i spent the extra on the used s8 plus. thankfully it arrived in near new condition and has worked flawlessly so far at a substantial discount for a larger size, high quality product with reasonable up to date specs, while i get to keep the full functionality of my watch. the tizen thing kind of sucks since i did get a mate se for my wife and it’s a great upgrade option to her m9 and she gets a brand new phone vs a used samsung, apple or other top tier phone, even if it’s more of a midrange phone.
i didn't want to spend a thousand dollars, nor did i want to wait to see what the galaxy 10 had to offer.  this s8 has all the features of a great smartphone, came unlocked so i can use it anywhere in the world, and at a price half that of an iphone or the s10.
love it!!! i accidentally dropped it in my dogs bowl of water, fully submerged, two days after i received it and 1 month later still works like a champ, no glitches,  nothing.
box did not come with the samsung factory seal, meaning it wasn't new.  i didn't even turned it on, just returned it.
i just discovered that the samsung galaxy s8+ phone i bought in early october from mercate is a dummy phone used for display.  i also received 3 iphone chargers with this ""phone."" i paid $549 for an alleged phone that is empty inside. why so long to discover i've been ripped off? i am the full-time caregiver for my 98 y/o mother with little time for myself. i went online & watched youtube repeatedly trying to get the phone open. i purchased a charger. i couldn't believe i had been ripped off until yesterday when a technician opened the "" phone"" & i saw it was empty inside.  i am retired & not wealthy & sick to realize i might have given mercate $549 for nothing.
samsung galaxy s8 unlocked 64gb - us version (midnight black) - us warrantytook a little bit of finagling to get the phone activated via. verizon called to get sim card shipped, then had to turn off family base because it is a carrier-based product.  after researching found this is common with unlocked phones.  but once that was done, phone active and running flawlessly so far.  big jump from s5 this phone replaced.
i've had three different iphones but i have been disappointed in the direction apple has done with the hardware of the newer phones and price.  i really i'm glad i made the switch and samsung galaxy 8+ phone six months in is working great. my only complaint is the bixby button is worthless and causes you issues at times when you meant to only change the volume.  speaking of volume the external speaker is not all that great but i usually use head phones so no worries. honestly i can do everything i did on the iphone and more with the samsung oh and i never have to worry about memory something apple is pathetic in pricing as well.
my phone arrived yesterday afternoon. i was able to copy the data from my old phone to this one without any problems. i wasn't able to activate it for my provider - metropcs. i had to go a store and the employee did that for me. all in all, the phone is working fine without any headaches that i was experiencing with my previous device. we won't mention the name of the company that sells this item.  the phone is much easier to work with, almost like an iphone. i have had one in the past. this phone has lots of memory, so feel free to download all the apps you need! i may update this review if necessary. for now, i'm very satisfied with this phone.
amazing phone. just about every thing of this phone is better than the top end of iphones. better screen. more memory. expansion slot. better form. +fingerprint sensor. great iris sensor, and a good face detection. better software controls because unlike ios, android gives you a lot of control over so many aspects of user experience.i used to be an iphone user for many years but finally got bored of the lackluster hardware, and being dictated what i should want from my phone. i use a standard ear phones, and expect my phone to honor my wishes.
the screen is incredible.  one of the best android phones out there if not the best.  camera is great in low light situations.  battery life is good and lasts me the whole day.  also has a quick charging feature if you use supported qualcomm quick charge adapters.  only thing that annoys me is the bixby feature.  i basically have disabled it and switched over to the google assistant.  default samsung applications for basic smart phone use are very good and minimalistic.  for example the calendaring, contacts, and messaging apps all support the basic needed functionality well.  best thing though is the screen when you are watching highdef video content or viewing your photos.  really clear when you've got the right content.
switched from an iphone 8 plus and have not been able to put it down. beats the iphone in every way. the radio reception is amazing as well. that goes for the cellular, wifi, bluetooth and gps. such an awesome phone. it just works and the battery life is amazing. samsung has done some nice touches to android. i love how bixby can help you optimize your phone for better battery life and clear the ram and cash. the build quality of this thing is amazing. even beats apple. i would even recommend this phone in 2018. yeah the s9 is coming but if you don't want the latest and greatest this phone is really worth a look.
this device has ver poor reception. also the bend touch screen does not work with any screen guard and is a pain to operate at edge touches dont work well
i've only had the phone for a few hours, but i can confirm that it can be activated on verizon.  i bought 2 phones, went into my local store to get one of them activated.  the clerk provided a sim card and got it running in just a few minutes (but be prepared to spend two or three hours reloading your apps and configuring the phone's options).waited to set up my second phone until my wife got home this evening.  i was planning on doing it myself online, but had a minor issue finding the right numbers on the phone itself (the online tool wasn't accepting the numbers).  i used verizon's online chat, and the operator had it up and running in just a few minutes.  no problems.
as good as they say, far as i can tell. very responsive, good storage capacity, the ui is good, cameras are outstanding compared to the average phone. the fingerprint scanner's position next to the camera is not so hard to get used to, and there's a biometric scanner as well if you're interested in health readings like heart rate and blood oxygen saturation. preloaded apps aren't intrusive, and don't clutter the system much.
only my 2nd day, but i think it's as expected.  the phone arrived in what appeared to be a new box, i swapped the sim, but the phone didn't ask the expected start up questions. my at&t go plan connected immediately on it's own. so i logged into my gmail account to establish the protection i read about and then took it to the at&t store to reset to factory default. process was easy to reset, and then the phone started asking all the startup questions. so i think i'm happy.
good phone. here are the pros n conspros:good cameravibrant screengreat battery lifegreat lookscons:very difficulf to find right tempered glass. as the edge function will not eork well. you end up using samsung flip cover, which hides all the buty.preloaded apps and bixy button are painful.
i bought this over the gs9 because the price is more than $100 cheaper, and it's the exact same phone as the gs9.there are very minor, subtle differences. it's not worth paying $140 more for a phone that is exactly like this one.i'm very satisfied with my purchase decision. this phone is great!
so far i love it.... after months of listening to my family tell me to retire my nexus 6 - amazon made it easy [price-wise] for me to do just that. e phone is way smaller - something i have to get used to, but lightening quick with responses.  the camera is great..i've only had it for 2 days, but it is pretty neat - so far.  pairs effortlessly with my car stereo and has many 'modern' features.... so far, so good...lol  if i should fall out of love with it - i will share that, too!
no issues connecting to verizon aside from a little difficulty fitting the sim card from my old phone into the caddy that pops out of the bottom of the s8+--a tight fit!  once inserted, the phone fired up immediately with no red verizon screen on startup any more.  from there, no problems making calls and texting.  would definitely buy again, though i wish someone would make a verizon compatible phone with an even larger screen (7.0""+....anyone...anyone....?)
awesome phone, i have seen some people say they got ripped off or not everything was in the box. you have to buy it from amazon not another seller, that's what i did and it was brand new. phone is really nice bit screen but it's thinner than most phones in a good way. no negative complaints so far. had a few galaxies in the past and iphones i switch every other phone between the two companies and this is probably the best galaxy yet i would say, the bixby button is annoying though.
works great. only problem i ran into was not knowing that this phone uses a nano sim instead of a micro sim, so i had to convert my sim card to the smaller size. i cut it down with scissors and it did the job. if you don't feel confident in your cutting abilities, you can go to a cell phone shop and ask them to cut it down for you. phone is fast and was easy to set up. works well with t-mobile.
this phone was not unlocked! took it to verizon and the tech could not get the sim to activate. he tried 10 different cards so the problem was with the phone. i read other reviews that said the same thing.  however...there is a workaround! he had to put the sim in another new phone, activate it, and then switch it to my phone. so glad it worked because i really like this phone and it was a lot cheaper than buying a new s9.
i have been using apple product for a while and have gotten used to them. i am still getting used to this phone.pros:it takes better pictures than my iphone 6.it seems to have a better battery life (for now)you can buy your own additional memory without paying apple.cons: be prepared to buy yet another charger cable.you will need to download some of your apps or have to search for a new one.you will have to search for some of your photos, mine got jumbled up. i didn't lose them but i couldn't find them too easily.
after 14.5 months of use. the battery is still strong. the buttons still work great.the only problem: the phone randomly restarts about 4 times a week. which is a little annoying because sometimes the phone doesn't recognize the sd card after one of those random restarts. this forces me to restart the phone again to mount the sd card
my problem with buying a phone from a carrier has been after a few years, support for security updates were up to the provider. problem is most smaller carriers do not maintain security updates. with this phone, you getting direct support from samsung and getting the latest recommended patches.
i don't like how ever since i've gotten this it constantly closes apps without me actually closing it. it glitches, so i'm factory resetting the phone in order just to use it. resetting only works for about an hour. i got 65 gigs of space but when i add more apps or even photos it gets extremely slow. it would be better if i just got the 16 gigs. i have been downloading multiple apps to speed it up or take off viruses. they dont work well. maybe i'm miss using but using this phone gets me frustrated.  i thought about giving it a few months just to fully get into the phone and i havent been able to stop the app closing and the glitching. i got more space than a 16 gig to use, not just to say i have 65 gigs of space.
was a great phone while it worked!  very speedy, very customizable, great screen.  loved it!..  i took very good care of it.  never dropped it, never submerged it, careful about overcharging, etc..  however, 2 months out of warranty.  the phone was just sitting on the table, and just went dark.  wouldn't turn back on, wouldn't charge (qi or usb), wouldn't boot to recovery, no nothing.  took it to ubreakifix, and it was listed as ""no signs of life"".  dead.  hopefully this was just a fluke, but still frustrating.
this has to be the worst phone i have ever bought. i bought it in april of 2018.i have never had a samsung phone before this one. i would rather use a flip phone than this.  picture quality looks like a 1mp camera. apps stay running after they are closed. constantly restarting the phone because it won't pick up on wifi. after it restarts your good for a day or two. everything looks good on paper but placing it in the real world is totally different.
the hardware is fantastic, superb looks and feels great in the hand.  the software is absolutely horrible.  it's so far removed from vanilla android it's like a completely different operating system, and you'll constantly be annoyed with popups, nuisance reminders, and other annoyances.  it constantly feels like your fighting with what samsung likes to call ""the samsung user experience"".  samsung should give customers the ability and choice of running a vanilla port of android and not this abomination of a ui,
received the phone. it worked fine for the first 6 weeks,then i lost battery power  i turned the phone off at night while charging, did not help. then every else started to fail. was sent to ""youbrakeifi ""  by samsung  tech support. diagnostic showed a flawed motherboard. i am leaving for overseas  next week. amazon  declined  refund,so i have no phone. this the only way i can communicate,  no other phone in house. i have to spend an other$700 today to buy a phone. will never ever purchase a phone from amazon. no support.
repackaged with sticky cellophane that left adhesive on back of phone and camera lenses that can't be removed. finger sensor appears dirty.  and nothing was in box except phone. no papers, no chargers, no headset. nothing.
i am a die hard apple person. all my desktop computers at home are apple, my other 4 family members all have iphones and we have laptops that are all apple. not really sure why i decided to try out the samsung galaxy s9+ but happy that i did so far. i was using a 4 1/2 year old iphone 5s so i figured any phone would be a huge upgrade to the modern world. it still takes a little getting used to coming from the ios system's way of doing things. i do lose the capability of imessage and facetime. not a huge deal and i can use the duo app from google which is the same as facetime. the key points with this phone are that the large and beautiful screen looks great. i like the haptic feel of the keys when texting how you feel the keys being pressed (a little buzz/vibration). i think the new iphone x does this too but again, i'm coming from a 5s. my only two choices for a new phone were this s9+ or keep on with apple and get an iphone x. the x would have cost me $1150 plus an applecare warranty for $200. i got this samsung (and got the ultimate play bundle) for $840 plus $100 for the bundle. took out a square trade 2 year warranty for $108 with only a $99 deductible should i need to use it. i have used square trade warranties in the past for other products and they have always replaced and stood by their guarantee. square trade is owned by allstate so i have confidence in them. getting back to the phone, the s9+ seems to work very fast when loading apps and pages. i use it for a lot of my wireless products at home (nest thermostat, wireless cameras, lifx lights, liftmaster garage door opener) and all work fast and flawlessly. the audio when playing music sounds great. plays very loud and clear for a phone. i like the fact that it does still have an earphone jack. i like the android system as it comes with google assistant voice command. most people hate the bixby feature on this phone. my only real gripe with it is the large button on the left side of the phone and that when trying to adjust the phone volume i accidentally hit bixby sometimes. i do like though that i's voice activated. i get in my car in the morning, speak to wake up bixby and command it to open up whatever app i need (usually waze). once open, i speak to waze to take me to work. all of this without having to look at my phones screen or take my eyes off the road. also, the bixby ai camera function is very cool too. there are about 8 or 9 different things it can do with the camera. like, point the camera lens at a sign in a foreign language and have it live translate the sign to english or any other language on the phone (and there are plenty of them on this phone). point it at food and it will tell you what it is and average calorie count. point it at a wine bottle label and it will give you the information on the wine (type, year, etc...). the only thing i think i will never use again and of course i tried it out is the animoji of myself or any of my friends. it's scary weird. everyone looks the same on this. i would personally like to see an update to the phone where they fix this to be more of a 3d type and look more realistic. i have been looking online for days at comparisons of the pictures taken on this phone compared to others. mot notably the iphone x. in my opinion, the x does do a lot of pix better. the contrast is usually better. the real advantage to this phone is it tends to overexpose a bit. so, dark scenes will look a bit brighter than on the iphone x. the only thing i had to get used to is the colors on a samsung phone are very oversaturated. colors are very bright. there is a setting in display function that gives you 4 options of view. i turned it down to one of them and it now looks a lot more realistic. i like the fact that this phone, as well as the iphone x, features ability to record video at 4k 60fps. looks great. on the samsung though the optical stabilization doesn't work when shooting 4k 60fps. keep a steady hand and this isn't an issue. for all other video formats, the stabilization on the samsung works better than the x. all in all, i am happy i went with the samsung. in a few months if i regret it, i can always keep it for a few months and sell it to get the new larger iphone x plus.update: 4/7/2018.  the voice unlock code is terrible. and, after searching through the options on the phone i came to the conclusion i don't need it. i have the face unlock or the fingerprint reader on the back. i actually go to the back fingerprint scan to unlock more than the other methods as it's just quick and easy to use. battery life has been good so far after using this phone for 3 weeks now. one thing i find annoying that i didn't know would be a problem is the video and picture quality when someone sends me a large video via texting. whether i send them a video or they send me one, it becomes such low quality that it's almost hard to see it at all. this is because of the compression the carriers use to send these video's or large picture files so it doesn't take up much space. i was used to having an iphone and using imessage. send any size video to someone else with an iphone and it was in great quality on both sides of the text. not so with android. now this is not just samsung but all android phones. so, for now, i have to send videos via whatsapp or viber (or a number of other text apps). they do compress but not horribly. oh, and one more note. i hope samsung corp is reading this review. the samsung customer service reps have to be the stupidest people i have ever dealt with for a tech company. i used to think comcast was bad until i called a couple of times and had to speak with someone at samsung. they just repeat my question and tell me they understand how i feel offering absolutely no answers. they put you on hold to find out but come back with no resolve. just terrible customer service. 180 degrees from dealing with someone at applecare when i had a question about my iphone or imac computer.2nd update: i didn't  realize this and this is very important to know before purchasing. in fact, i'm on the at&t network with my phone and the people in the factory store didn't know this. the sales people in best buy in the phone department did not know this either. when you buy an unlocked galaxy s9 or s9+, your phone is $840. if however you want to buy it thru at&t for their network and not a factory unlocked phone, it has different options on it. meaning, the unlocked phone will not have: wifi calling option, hd audio option, vvm (video voice messaging) and you will not get video voice calling. the option for these features is not even on my phone. now, you can buy the at&t phone and pay $915 up front or on a plan (either way it's $75 more than the factory unlocked phone). after you pay $75 ,more and if you are paying the full price up front, you can get the at&t phone unlocked and then you will have these features. nowhere at best buy or any at&t store do they tell you this. in my mind, it's a great misrepresentation that is omitted when purchasing. i picked up the bundle package here on amazon for $100 more and got a lot of cool gadgets so i'm keeping my setup. i just want others to know there is a difference when buying the unlocked version both in price and the feature set you get. i figured the at&t version just had a bunch of their proprietary apps pre-installed. hope this helps out someone beforehand that really wants those features. and, i went to the at&t store figuring there was a way they could flash the options to my phone. there isn't. they cannot update your phone to get these options.3rd update: april 15th, 2018i discovered a great feature today. i wish these galaxy 9 phones had the rise to wake feature which is what the iphone x has. you pick up the phone and just look at it to unlock via your face and it's good to go. what i discovered is setting the google assistant to open the galaxy even from the locked screen via my voice and the phone unlocks and does what you ask the google assistant to do. love this feature immensely.4th update april 23, 2018as i play around more with this phone, i am learning some cool things it can do. for instance, from the factory it come pre-set so that whether you swipe up or down the phone will go to your app tray. no need for repetition with swiping either up or down. there is a setting so that when you swipe up it opens the app tray (as it come from samsung pre-set) but change the setting and when you swipe down from any place on the phone and you've got your phones popular settings in front of you. even better, if you swipe down using two fingers from the top of the screen, it opens the second part of the settings which control other functions (usually this is a two part deal so this makes it one step easier). also, one thing samsung addressed with the 9 and 9+ (using the oreo software) is a problem people using these phones prior used to hate. now, you can set the up/down volume buttons to control media volume no matter what you are viewing. and, if you want to control the ringtone or another type of volume, when you push up or down on the volume and the media volume shows just tap on the down arrow on the top left of the screen and you have all the others ready to adjust exactly as you like them. apparently from reading online this has been an annoyance of a problem for a long time with the galaxy phones that is now solved.
the box i received didn't have a phone in it!!! instead, it had a cheap plastic phone case. also, the box had no seal on it so it could have been tampered with at any point. i watched ""unboxing"" videos for this phone, and there's supposed to be a sticker seal you have to break to open the box. from other reviews, it sounds like other customers have received empty boxes or dummy phones.customer service is processing a replacement. hopefully that goes alright. i'll update the review when i have more info on the replacement.
when the phone arrived excited to use  it then boom it does not work! it is an unlocked phone they say but it really isn't. their customer service stinks  and are no help. i want my money back!
mine stopped working after 45 days.. was working on it and all of a sudden it ga e colors and then black screen. so disappointing
great phone but a few problems and some thing you need to clear up and be more clear about when i got the phone it was not sealed and when i took it to get it actived i was told it was used other then that everything seems to be in the box and works just fine but you need to let ppl know these phones have been opened
metropcs initially had issues getting it added to my account, but i woke up the next morning and it was working fine. so, if anyone is wondering it does work on metropcs/t-mobile network! :) in the usa [i'm in st. louis, mo
bought this phone instead of buying directly from samsung. big mistake! just save yourself the trouble and buy from samsung directly!
i ordered the unlocked single-sim usa version of this phone (sm-g960u) which is compatible with all usa carriers. that same model number was stamped on the exterior label of the box. however, inside the box was the cheaper, dual-sim international phone (sm-g960f/ds) which won't work with verizon or sprint cdma bands.i ordered from amazon because the phone price was discounted $50, but this turned out to be a disappointing experience and waste of time. from now on i will buy my cell phones in person at an authorized distributor to make sure i get what i am paying for.
i bought 2 phones and 1 works perfectly but the other is trash. essential features dont work and its not worth the money.
i was skeptical and afraid to buy after reading every single review. i however gave them the benefit of the doubt. it was the biggest mistake and i regret every damn second. i had this phone for literally 8 hours! 8 damn hours. for the first few hours the phone turned on the graphics on this phone looked amazing. i left for a store run to buy a phone case and screen protector. i was excited. i put on the screen protector and as i went to turn it on....nothing... black screen. i did everything. i tried to reset it, hard reset, plugged it in to its charger nothing. bunch of bull. just don't buy from them. don't even bother. i don't even know why this vendor is even still allowed to sell products. they needto be taken down. amazon needs to know how they are effing their customers over. just stay away.
this phone is supposed to be brand-new and unlocked. it looks brand-new, and so far, it is working fine, but the box was missing the sim ejecting needle and the beginners manual. i had the sim ejecting needle and i downloaded the users manual from samsung.com. after activating the phone with the tracfone carrier i got a message asking me to activate the phone with spring.  there is a way to go around that issue, and you do not get the message anymore as long as the phone stays on all the time, it is not a big deal. i contacted the seller through amazon, and he offered me a refund, but i do not want to return it because the phone is great. i would like the problem fixed.
good phone, but do not fall prey to the samsung trade in program. its impossible to find how to do the trade in and it has multiple stipulations.
exactly as advertised. brand new us unlocked model of the galaxy s9 (sm-g960u1). works perfectly with all the sums i've tried (at&t &verizon) get better service with verizon in my area. being the unlocked model it isn't full of carrier bloatware so if you don't have a use for those many of them can just be downloaded. completely satisfied.also believe this phone pick up different waves than the s8 i used to get 3 bars consistently in my area with the s8 and i've had 4 with this one since i set it up.
fake cloned phone. do not buy u'll be wasting your time and money. buy directly from samsung. please double check if you have a cloned phone or not. this is very deceptive
i was nervous about purchasing an unlocked phone from amazon, not knowing what i'd get. but i purchased this, sold and fulfilled by amazon, and have been very pleased with my s9.  i had to purchase a separate sim card from my carrier, t-mobile,  but that is true with any unlocked phone you buy.  this doesn't come with a wall or car charger but that is true for all s9's so you have to purchase these separately.  i've had earlier versions of samsung phones and this is the best phone i've had in terms of screen clarity, memory speed, photo quality, audio and much more.  if you are considering buying this phone, your best best is to buy directly from amazon as a seller, not a third party seller.  otherwise, be sure to read the third party's terms carefully and be aware buying from a third party seller comes with risks.
this phone is absolutely fabulous!!  i switched from a moto x pure~ which i loved ~ so this is a huge upgrade.  it was so so easy to set up ~ there is an adapter included that you attach to your old phone and use an app to copy all of your files.  awesome.  it is super fast and i love how customizable it is,  from themes to icons to fonts.  i haven't had any issues with bixby.  sound is awesome  and sound is a very important aspect to me.  the display is beautiful and camera is fabulous.  i am so concerned about breakage ~ i have ms and tend to twitch a lot and i drop things.  so i researched forever for a protective but pretty case and i hope i found it.  i also have a screen protector and a pop socket.  and i love the whole set up.  it now feels really secure in my hand.  the case did add a bit of weight but i don't mind.  i also worried about getting a fake phone or an empty box~ i purchased an unlocked phone and worried about that l.  research your seller ~ i even emailed them and told them my concerns before i purchased mine.  i ended up getting mine from endlessitems17 and highly recommend them.  amazon didn't update the seller's stock before i already bought it.  they contacted me the same day,  offered me a black one, or a refund, or wait till they got one in.  i chose to wait rather than a refund cuz who knows how long that would take!  they weren't supposed to get any in for three days and that was monday.  customer service was awesome ~ said that they would try to find one quicker~ and i recieved my phone yesterday ~ wednesday!  it came in perfect condition,  and was a breeze for metro to get it up and running.  i am totally happy with this phone and recommend buying it!
this phone is leagues better than my s6 was, mostly due to refinement of the phone rather than innovation. it does everything you want it to, has a great camera, beautiful screen, and everything you've come to expect from a samsung flagship.that said, it's not a massive improvement from the s8. it's more polished, but it is essentially the same phone.if your got a need to upgrade to a new device from a 3+ year old device, absolutely worth the investment. from a more modern phone, not so much.
hi good day i purchased this phone an it giving problems its getting hot the apps are taking long to open it is constantly freezing
i was concerned about ordering the unlocked s9 after reading several mixed reviews on whether or not this was compatible with verizon and some people saying they recieved refurbished or defective phones.  after more research and a nice sale price i took a bit of a chance and pulled the trigger.  glad i did.  received the phone in perfectly new condition and no issues on verizon network at all.  i just popped in my sim and it's worked perfectly since.  coming from an s8, the s9 is almost identical....with some notable improvements.  but i'm not going to turn this into an s9 product review.  if you're looking here for an unlocked phone to purchase, you already know if you like the s9 or not.  anyway, i got a good quality, new phone at a much better price than i could have got direct from v, bb, or most other stores (unless you want to lock yourself in with a carrier for two years).
the heart rate monitor not working , there is no rubber seal protecting the sim and micr sd card from water , poor display quality , poor camera , everything is just a big no. this is the first time i have ever experience this problem with amazon , and this is making me want to stop purchasing from amazon. i love amazon , but , if this is what they're doing to their loyal customers , i will not stand for it , but , i hope this was just a mistake that was made and not a scheme.
i switched to the s9 after i saw the price of the iphonex. i am not disappointed with switching to samsung, this phone has a much better display and camera than the iphones do. the pictures in the dark are phenomenal. it was easy to transfer all the data from my iphone because of the easy set up features. if your thinking about switching from the iphone, do it, you will not be disappointed.
pros: overall great phone-camera has high resolution and is ok for lower light photography due to dual apertures-great listening experience with dual speakers for stereo sound-one of the best displays on a smartphone, oled-wireless charging-a headphone jack-beautiful form factor with the display curving over the sidescon: possibly incompatible with cellular carrier (check model number)-for those not living in the uk, the listed model number is unlocked for the uk.the description does not explicitly list the compatible region for the listed model. i live in the us, but the model i received was sm-g960f/ds, which is an unlocked version with dual sim for the uk. this model is not compatible with verizon, sprint, and possibly other us cellular carriers.
was not given the actual phone. only a display model with no hardware, screen, camera, etc.
very nice upgrade from s7. i'm glad i went with the s9+ . i really like the big screen, and extra camera.
deffective and you get charged 15 per cent restocking fees and you pay for return shipping.not worth it
excellent smartphone for the busy professional as well as for those moments when you just need to relax and unwind. a super fast processor and an awesome camera that is above average. i especially like the speed with which the intellegent scanner and fingerprint scanner both work to unlock the screen. this comes in handy in situations where you need a quick peek at messages or other info on the notification panel. the best smartphone that samsung has ever produced and definitely the best smartphone for 2018.
 after doing about a month of research for what i want a phone to do and how much battery life and other features inside a phone it beats all the other phones i've had out of the water.  granted i've only have phones 2013 or older this is like a night and day difference for my experience with phones.pros - sound quality out of the speakers is phenomal with highs not being too tiny and the bass not being too overbearing. - picture quality set to the max qwhd+ is a glorious thing - camera us stronger than a canon g7x that i recently purchased only downside being the zoom function makes it rather quick to get blurry.  - beautiful slo-mo option for video capture  - selfie camera is amazing as well with the filter options to clear up a face and also has a wide selfie option for large groups of people  - video recording is phenomenal with tracking and motion capturing - lightning fast loads on apps and web pages when my connection is strong. - fingerprint open on the back of phone conveniently placed - iris scanning - plenty of battery life for a full days use of gps tracking and music playing - samsung pay option for paying for items without needing to pull out a cardcons - camera zoom function isn't doing much good for picture quality but i understand it is in a small handheld device - price tag as always with flagship phones are rather high but paying it out right for me and flipping the phone for newer flag ships in the future doesn't make it all that expensive of a purchase when i go with a resale value in a couple years.all in all i do enjoy this phone and for me i found it this phone to be completely worth it as just through the experience i've had with the pictures and battery life alone.  it has yet to have any hiccups while using the phone and always does what i need it to do.only con that i have against it would be the price otherwise the phone is a complete stellar buy.
after opening the shipping box i found a wrong item inside. instead of a galaxy s9, there was a galaxy s9+ box sealed with shipping tape on both ends. i opened the box and found no phone inside, only some chains, yes chains, wrapped on a napkin, a samsung charger, a couple of generic chargers and some other small accessories.i reported the incident to amazon but they were unable to help me, unless a police report was filed.
this, most definitely is the best smartphone you can get today. it's so beautiful. i fall in love with it every single day. add the wireless charger, ear buds, and watch, and you've got yourself an amazing smartphone experience.you do need to get a cover for the glass back though, because it's not as strong as it is proposed to be. get the alcantara case from samsung. also, stick with apps from the play store, and themes from samsung ™, you'll have a hitch free, glitch free ride..
i retrurned the device(galaxy s9+) that i got from this seller(relliant celular) because it was not new and it was not unlocked like the seller claims on the selling page (did not work with verizon). i spent some more money and bought it eventualy at best buy and it works great and its also new so make your decisions... this called misleading the customer
the phone is fast, with a solid build.  but the signal reception is horrible.  at my home the signal is always weak, but my motorola g5 plus had much better reception.  the range for cell service is -50 to -120.  closer to -50 is better, but this s9 is -118 in a weak area, but still -113 in a good area!  if you don't need a 3.5mm headphone jack, then get the z3 play.  it's far better as a phone, and motorola really knows what they're doing with convenience.  i loved my g5+, but i loved my samsung s3, s4 and s5 too.  but this s9 is pretty poor.
i have just received it, and it’s great that there’s an option to transfer data onto it from other phones, including my iphone se. other reviews claimed that there was no phone in the box, or accessories were missing. this made me a bit skeptical and worried, but i’m glad i took the gamble. a beautiful phone, and the infinity screen makes it more beautiful. fingerprint scanner is an a very efficient place and takes less than 3 seconds to set up. i will be back with another review in a month or so.
lovin' this phone! clobbered the front of its s9 predecessor, so i ordered this phone and simply switched sim cards ... bingo, connected to the at&t network without a hitch. these phones are so smart - it downloaded/uploaded all the prior info from the dead phone. buy with confidence. thanks, amazon for offering ""unlocked"" phones!
very happy with my purchase. i was a little skeptical ordering it online, but decided to give it a go. phone came within a couple days of ordering. packaging was very good, and phone was in mint condition. photo quality is awesome! this was one of my main reasons for purchasing this phone. i previously owned a samsung s7. some features have changed on the phone, for example the home button is no longer there, and has the bixby feature which i am trying to figure out. overall would highly recommend!
i read some disturbing reviews on here for this phone, but they seemed to be more for the sellers than the actual phone. i got my blue s9+ direct from amazon and it was brand new & perfectly intact. it was insanely easy to transfer all of the info from my old phone and to have my service switched to the new phone. it's beautiful and a nice upgrade from my lg v20. the best part is that i bought it here for about $300 less than i would have with my carrier. excellent buy, very happy!
i've been an iphone user for 12 years and this is my first samsung so it's taking a little getting used to.  ive been spoiled by having a phone that flawlessly synced with my mac.  however i'm digging the extended battery life, the camera clarity, the screens resolution adjustability, the expandable memory  and things like that which have made the switch pleasant.  the only reason i'm not giving it 5 stars is the price and the lack of usb audio play through car audio systems.  even with black friday pricing the s9 isn't really competitive in the price department.  for unknown reasons samsung did away with the simple plug and play usb audio.  there is a mirror link app on the phone for using usb audio only a few cars have that capability.
we purchased 2 of these devices one was still in the wrapping with no issues and the other had been used, was missing the charger and the adapter piece. both phones worked great but we paid for a new phone and received a used one and were left without a charger and adapter.
so different from previous models. removed many of the options i need and loved.  sad.i needed more internal memory. almost left galaxy after many years due to curved infinity screen and silly edge. bixby is useless.i was advised by many techs not to purchase this model.  i finally decided based on slo mo, avitar & more memory.iphones are more sturdy & have better batteries but no micro sd card!when galaxy removes sd card i'll leave them for iphone as i can no longer replace batteries in galaxy. why galaxy? praying battery lasts.very complex phone with long learning curve. too many options! hate curved infinity screen, bixby & edge. useless waste!64 gb memory is great so far. once you buy alexa you need so much more internal memory.not sure how long battery will last. crossing my fingers since it can't be replaced.why on earth did they use curved infinity screen? very hard to find case and screen protectors that work.  phone is so fragile.what is value and purpose  of ""bixby""? also find ""edge""useless and unnecessary.great stereo sound on movies.still learning phone hidden tricks after many weeks! learning curve takes forever.will test with camera soon and get back to you. i loved the s4 and s5 cameras. why less mp now on this model?
after 3 months with this phone, i can conclude that this is a very solid android phone. jam-packed with features like stereo speakers, led indicator, wireless charging, face unlock/iris scanner, fast fingerprint sensor with gesture controls, headphone jack (obviously), 1440p super oled display and plenty of others features. the cameras, while nowhere near the level of the google pixel 3, are still very strong on their own, producing quality photos, steady video, and surprisingly good portrait mode. only downsides are that the battery drains a little faster expected, a dedicated bixby button which can be really annoying if you press on accident, samsung bloatware, and a very tacky ar emoji. coming from an lifelong iphone user, i can confidently say that anyone who isn’t too attached to the apple ecosystem will have an amazing experience. this is my first android phone, and can say with confidence that samsung successfully made me satisfied with my purchase.
this is the best (and most beautiful) phone of 2018, hands down.pixel 3 xl has a worse processor, less ram, worse battery, no equalizer, no dex, no hdmi output, no sd slot, the stupid notch, and is $200 more expensive.iphone xs max has similar performance, no fingerprint sensor, worse battery life, no sd slot, the stupid notch, no dex, and is $400-600 more expensive.note 9 is too big for one-handed use, too big for most pockets, has the same processor as this phone, but is $300 more expensive (tho if u use the spen, that's the best phone for u).seriously, i waited for all the flagship announcements, only to find out that the s9+, announced 6 months ago, is still the best phone of the year, and it's not even close.completely customizable, and just a pleasure to use. the new samsung software is much better than the old bulk in the days of s3 or even note3. i'm coming from pixel xl, and i can vouch for this sw being very lightweight, useful, and snappy.also, the always-on-display is just a pleasure. i don't think i'll want to go back to not having this option. battery life is amazing. i'm very happy with this phone
note, when you purchase this product the name beneath the title of the product is the manufacturer name not the vendor! not only was the phone i received different than the one i ordered but they also did not include a charging cable with the product. don't let them fool you, these phones are not new, and they are not being sold by samsung. do yourself a favor and just go to best buy instead.
my s7 edge lcd screen just died last month so i needed a phone right away. i am currently with verizon, so it sort of limits my phone choices. this phone works with verizon, it was cheaper than buying it directly from verizon, and i didn't have to pay an activation fee since i used my old sim card.in all honesty, i like the looks of the s7 edge better than this s9. i also miss having a physical button at the bottom of the phone.passive battery life on the s9 has been amazing so far. my old phone would be almost completely drained by the end of the day if i just checked it every once in a while. with the s9, i was periodically checking my phone once in a while, sending texts, etc., and i still had over 50% by midnight. some apps do kill the battery life pretty quickly, but the phone will notify you every once in a while when it notices you have apps running in the background.have not had time to play around with bixby yet.
my three stars has more to do with amazon's screw up than the phone itself.when you get your phone, check the model number !!!should be sm-g960u1.i ordered the us unlocked galaxy s9 (model number sm-g960u1), but amazon sent me a chinese unlocked phone (model number sm-g9600). although they look the same, the chinese phone only sort of works (dropped calls, poor sound quality, incoming calls go straight to voice mail), does not have a us warranty (all support comes out of china), and critical features your carrier offers will be disabled (such as t-mobile's wifi calling).it took me over a month to figure out why my wonderful galaxy s9 was a piece of crap. and neither amazon nor samsung were of much help in discovering the source of my problem. it wasn't until i tried to register my phone with samsung's u.s. website and failed that i got a clue.after much to do, amazon replaced my chinese phone with the correct one. like magic everything appears to be working fine including wifi calling.
i upgraded to the galaxy s9 from the galaxy s3. there are many improvements, however a lot was familiar. used it on the at&t network. it was easy getting a sim from them and replacing the s3 on my account.  one note:  at&t does not call the galaxy s9 by name on your account device page because you did not buy it from them.  they simply call it a ""device"".  this designation does not cause any issues with billing or anything else on your account. i asked support to change ""device"" to galaxy s9, but it never went through.  the camera itself has beautiful playback of all forms of media and has a great battery life. i'm not wild about the sidebar tabs to stow all your contacts and apps, i think they get in the way of other things you are doing.  summary: great phone.
awesome phone and love the fact that it's unlocked so no additional junk from your carrier if you would purchased it thru a carrier. i did have an issue about warranty but from the samsung care + side but was not disclosd when purchasing this phone. all in all amazon was willing to resolve the matter and gave me other options to purchase warranty. so overall love the phone and amazon customer service is top notch!!!!!
due to all the negative comments that previous people wrote regarding receiving boxes with no phones, or phones with scratches or previously used phones i was hesitant to make this purchase but happy to report the following:the samsung galaxy s9 unlocked (us version) 256gb coral blue phone arrived in brand new condition.  packaging was brand new with seals on packaging and phone also had factory protective clear films front and back. (gm960u1 model)  also packaged with the phone was the charger, all instructions, card tray key, and headphones.
has the typical oem bloatware as well as some google and third-party software that can't be removed. the hardware bixby button is an obvious attempt at overriding google assistant.  it's very easy to activate unintentionally.a samsung account is necessary to use their competing features; even some that don't make sense to need an account.the screen is brilliant and beautiful. the curved edges give it an attractive illusion of depth. battery life is very good and recharge is very fast.  samsung has the best swipe and predictive qwerty of all brands i've owned.i'm very happy with my purchase.
i purchased this amazon warehouse purchase because i could not bring myself to pay full price for todays high end smartphones.  after looking at the product i received it looks and functions as new.  i am deducting two stars because i tried to register the phone for warranty service to find that it couldn't be registered.  so i'm pulling one star for amazon listing it as having a us warranty, and one star from samsung for not being able to register the product.  i will continue to test the functionality of this phone in the coming week.  great value for the money if samsung supports the product as advertised.
received the phone. it worked fine for the first 6 weeks,then i lost battery power  i turned the phone off at night while charging, did not help. then every else started to fail. was sent to ""youbrakeifi ""  by samsung  tech support. diagnostic showed a flawed motherboard. i am leaving for overseas  next week. amazon  declined  refund,so i have no phone. this the only way i can communicate,  no other phone in house. i have to spend an other$700 today to buy a phone. will never ever purchase a phone from amazon. no support.
repackaged with sticky cellophane that left adhesive on back of phone and camera lenses that can't be removed. finger sensor appears dirty.  and nothing was in box except phone. no papers, no chargers, no headset. nothing.
i am a die hard apple person. all my desktop computers at home are apple, my other 4 family members all have iphones and we have laptops that are all apple. not really sure why i decided to try out the samsung galaxy s9+ but happy that i did so far. i was using a 4 1/2 year old iphone 5s so i figured any phone would be a huge upgrade to the modern world. it still takes a little getting used to coming from the ios system's way of doing things. i do lose the capability of imessage and facetime. not a huge deal and i can use the duo app from google which is the same as facetime. the key points with this phone are that the large and beautiful screen looks great. i like the haptic feel of the keys when texting how you feel the keys being pressed (a little buzz/vibration). i think the new iphone x does this too but again, i'm coming from a 5s. my only two choices for a new phone were this s9+ or keep on with apple and get an iphone x. the x would have cost me $1150 plus an applecare warranty for $200. i got this samsung (and got the ultimate play bundle) for $840 plus $100 for the bundle. took out a square trade 2 year warranty for $108 with only a $99 deductible should i need to use it. i have used square trade warranties in the past for other products and they have always replaced and stood by their guarantee. square trade is owned by allstate so i have confidence in them. getting back to the phone, the s9+ seems to work very fast when loading apps and pages. i use it for a lot of my wireless products at home (nest thermostat, wireless cameras, lifx lights, liftmaster garage door opener) and all work fast and flawlessly. the audio when playing music sounds great. plays very loud and clear for a phone. i like the fact that it does still have an earphone jack. i like the android system as it comes with google assistant voice command. most people hate the bixby feature on this phone. my only real gripe with it is the large button on the left side of the phone and that when trying to adjust the phone volume i accidentally hit bixby sometimes. i do like though that i's voice activated. i get in my car in the morning, speak to wake up bixby and command it to open up whatever app i need (usually waze). once open, i speak to waze to take me to work. all of this without having to look at my phones screen or take my eyes off the road. also, the bixby ai camera function is very cool too. there are about 8 or 9 different things it can do with the camera. like, point the camera lens at a sign in a foreign language and have it live translate the sign to english or any other language on the phone (and there are plenty of them on this phone). point it at food and it will tell you what it is and average calorie count. point it at a wine bottle label and it will give you the information on the wine (type, year, etc...). the only thing i think i will never use again and of course i tried it out is the animoji of myself or any of my friends. it's scary weird. everyone looks the same on this. i would personally like to see an update to the phone where they fix this to be more of a 3d type and look more realistic. i have been looking online for days at comparisons of the pictures taken on this phone compared to others. mot notably the iphone x. in my opinion, the x does do a lot of pix better. the contrast is usually better. the real advantage to this phone is it tends to overexpose a bit. so, dark scenes will look a bit brighter than on the iphone x. the only thing i had to get used to is the colors on a samsung phone are very oversaturated. colors are very bright. there is a setting in display function that gives you 4 options of view. i turned it down to one of them and it now looks a lot more realistic. i like the fact that this phone, as well as the iphone x, features ability to record video at 4k 60fps. looks great. on the samsung though the optical stabilization doesn't work when shooting 4k 60fps. keep a steady hand and this isn't an issue. for all other video formats, the stabilization on the samsung works better than the x. all in all, i am happy i went with the samsung. in a few months if i regret it, i can always keep it for a few months and sell it to get the new larger iphone x plus.update: 4/7/2018.  the voice unlock code is terrible. and, after searching through the options on the phone i came to the conclusion i don't need it. i have the face unlock or the fingerprint reader on the back. i actually go to the back fingerprint scan to unlock more than the other methods as it's just quick and easy to use. battery life has been good so far after using this phone for 3 weeks now. one thing i find annoying that i didn't know would be a problem is the video and picture quality when someone sends me a large video via texting. whether i send them a video or they send me one, it becomes such low quality that it's almost hard to see it at all. this is because of the compression the carriers use to send these video's or large picture files so it doesn't take up much space. i was used to having an iphone and using imessage. send any size video to someone else with an iphone and it was in great quality on both sides of the text. not so with android. now this is not just samsung but all android phones. so, for now, i have to send videos via whatsapp or viber (or a number of other text apps). they do compress but not horribly. oh, and one more note. i hope samsung corp is reading this review. the samsung customer service reps have to be the stupidest people i have ever dealt with for a tech company. i used to think comcast was bad until i called a couple of times and had to speak with someone at samsung. they just repeat my question and tell me they understand how i feel offering absolutely no answers. they put you on hold to find out but come back with no resolve. just terrible customer service. 180 degrees from dealing with someone at applecare when i had a question about my iphone or imac computer.2nd update: i didn't  realize this and this is very important to know before purchasing. in fact, i'm on the at&t network with my phone and the people in the factory store didn't know this. the sales people in best buy in the phone department did not know this either. when you buy an unlocked galaxy s9 or s9+, your phone is $840. if however you want to buy it thru at&t for their network and not a factory unlocked phone, it has different options on it. meaning, the unlocked phone will not have: wifi calling option, hd audio option, vvm (video voice messaging) and you will not get video voice calling. the option for these features is not even on my phone. now, you can buy the at&t phone and pay $915 up front or on a plan (either way it's $75 more than the factory unlocked phone). after you pay $75 ,more and if you are paying the full price up front, you can get the at&t phone unlocked and then you will have these features. nowhere at best buy or any at&t store do they tell you this. in my mind, it's a great misrepresentation that is omitted when purchasing. i picked up the bundle package here on amazon for $100 more and got a lot of cool gadgets so i'm keeping my setup. i just want others to know there is a difference when buying the unlocked version both in price and the feature set you get. i figured the at&t version just had a bunch of their proprietary apps pre-installed. hope this helps out someone beforehand that really wants those features. and, i went to the at&t store figuring there was a way they could flash the options to my phone. there isn't. they cannot update your phone to get these options.3rd update: april 15th, 2018i discovered a great feature today. i wish these galaxy 9 phones had the rise to wake feature which is what the iphone x has. you pick up the phone and just look at it to unlock via your face and it's good to go. what i discovered is setting the google assistant to open the galaxy even from the locked screen via my voice and the phone unlocks and does what you ask the google assistant to do. love this feature immensely.4th update april 23, 2018as i play around more with this phone, i am learning some cool things it can do. for instance, from the factory it come pre-set so that whether you swipe up or down the phone will go to your app tray. no need for repetition with swiping either up or down. there is a setting so that when you swipe up it opens the app tray (as it come from samsung pre-set) but change the setting and when you swipe down from any place on the phone and you've got your phones popular settings in front of you. even better, if you swipe down using two fingers from the top of the screen, it opens the second part of the settings which control other functions (usually this is a two part deal so this makes it one step easier). also, one thing samsung addressed with the 9 and 9+ (using the oreo software) is a problem people using these phones prior used to hate. now, you can set the up/down volume buttons to control media volume no matter what you are viewing. and, if you want to control the ringtone or another type of volume, when you push up or down on the volume and the media volume shows just tap on the down arrow on the top left of the screen and you have all the others ready to adjust exactly as you like them. apparently from reading online this has been an annoyance of a problem for a long time with the galaxy phones that is now solved.
the box i received didn't have a phone in it!!! instead, it had a cheap plastic phone case. also, the box had no seal on it so it could have been tampered with at any point. i watched ""unboxing"" videos for this phone, and there's supposed to be a sticker seal you have to break to open the box. from other reviews, it sounds like other customers have received empty boxes or dummy phones.customer service is processing a replacement. hopefully that goes alright. i'll update the review when i have more info on the replacement.
when the phone arrived excited to use  it then boom it does not work! it is an unlocked phone they say but it really isn't. their customer service stinks  and are no help. i want my money back!
mine stopped working after 45 days.. was working on it and all of a sudden it ga e colors and then black screen. so disappointing
arguably the best smartphone that i've ever purchased.  works great and plenty of great features.  great camera.i had no real problems switching the sim card from my old phone to the s9+.so why did i give it only 4 stars?  well, i find bixby of little value for me and i accidentally press its button at times.  also that facebook is permanently installed (can be ""disabled"").  however according to my router of my wifi network, there is communications to and from facebook (unknown which source/app on the phone is the cause).
great phone but a few problems and some thing you need to clear up and be more clear about when i got the phone it was not sealed and when i took it to get it actived i was told it was used other then that everything seems to be in the box and works just fine but you need to let ppl know these phones have been opened
metropcs initially had issues getting it added to my account, but i woke up the next morning and it was working fine. so, if anyone is wondering it does work on metropcs/t-mobile network! :) in the usa [i'm in st. louis, mo
bought this phone instead of buying directly from samsung. big mistake! just save yourself the trouble and buy from samsung directly!
i ordered the unlocked single-sim usa version of this phone (sm-g960u) which is compatible with all usa carriers. that same model number was stamped on the exterior label of the box. however, inside the box was the cheaper, dual-sim international phone (sm-g960f/ds) which won't work with verizon or sprint cdma bands.i ordered from amazon because the phone price was discounted $50, but this turned out to be a disappointing experience and waste of time. from now on i will buy my cell phones in person at an authorized distributor to make sure i get what i am paying for.
i'm not sure if it was just the phone or if the s9 actually isn't as good as i thought it would be.. i'm thinking it was the phone because i upgraded to the s9 plus and am now absolutely in love with it. i did order this one 1st though and had a lot of trouble with the voice to text. actually texting was really hard in general too. that made it kind of a bummer to play around on because i use voice command a lot. i decided to return it and just got my refund.. i am so thankful i was able to get that at least!! that's the only reason i rated at 3 stars instead of only two.
phone takes good pictures, too bad it just doesnt want to charge.  amazon wants to charge me 8 dollars to refund this garbage, and the garbage insurance i purchased wants 90 dollars to replace their shoddy product.im broke at the moment, and i am currently missing out on a phone interview for a second job because it wont charge. i missed going to the bank because what should have taken 3 seconds to replace a shoddy product sold by one of the wealthiest companies in the world turned into taking an entire afternoon and evening to fixstay away from this garbage phone and company amazon when buying phones, this is the second phone in a row.  amazon is a scam.
i purchased this phone some months ago and was extremely excited to try it out. it arrived perfectly with all the parts and pieces it was supposed to come with and for the first two months i was completely satisfied with my purchase. i'd also took measures and purchased a heavy duty phone case and a screen protector to make sure this puppy lasted me a while. however, two months in, my phone started unexpectedly freezing and the battery life was starting to decline rapidly. i had only used 18 of the 64 gb available but i took the time to clean out my storage and any unnecessary files anyways in hopes that the phone's behavior would improve. to my surprise, its performance was rapidly declining more and more by the days. not long after it got to the point where my phone screen would randomly turn itself off and not turn back on. the phone would vibrate like it would when it was on when i'd press the home button but the screen would not light up. it would do this multiple times a day and i would have to manually soft reset it every single time. i reached out to samsung support and was not able to receive any help or answers from them. by this point my 30-day warranty had already expired and amazon would no longer be able to exchange the phone for me. i wish i had just spent a few dollars extra to make sure that i had received a reliable phone. very unsatisfied
just ordered this device to replace an older s7 edge whose battery expanded on me and took the back of the phone out with it as it expanded - that phone was only three years old but well beyond its warranty.i hope the battery on the s9 won't go the way the s7 did.enabling the s9 on the verizon network only involved swapping the sim card between devices.  it confused me a bit because it was my understanding i would have to register the devices exchange on the verizon website.  it happened automatically after installing the old sim card in the new phone.the device came with android oreo from february 2018 installed - needed a couple of patch updates.  it also came charged 96%.the s9 has a smaller screen, it's a bit lighter and much more responsive  than the s7 edge.  it could also be that it's new so android isn't as bloated, although it has all my data and apps moved over.  transferring data and settings was a snap - used the samsung utility and usb cable adapter to do this.good experience so far to get going, if something happens, i'll be back here to amend this review.  excellent experience so far with both the phone and amazon's handling of it.
a really good phone, neat features.the speaker is not working after about two weeks.
took the phone to the verizon store and was told that it was incompatible with their network. don't waste your time with this if you have verizon.
the battery life was shorter than a new phone. the phone itself was fine but the description was misleading as #1 the ""us warranty"" stated in the title is void when reselling a used phone. it also states, ""accessories may have cosmetic damage"" this was false as well because the original items were completely replaced by generic headphones and power cord. you will not receive what was promised unless you buy a new phone, which i had to do. i had to return this item, and am still waiting for my refund.
i bought this phone because it could be used with cdma and sim cards both.  i had planned on using verizon at home and wanted to be able to purchase sim cards to use in the phone when i travel internationally.  but this phone appears to be an at&t phone that is ""unlocked"" so that it can also be used on t-mobile and presumably, other sim cards.  i have wasted a week's time, tried a couple of different sim cards from a couple of different carriers, purchased a new sim card, and am just done with this.  do not believe the q&a section where it says the phone can be used with all 4 carriers.  it absolutely cannot.  i will be returning this.
i upgraded from the samsung s8 to the samsung s9+.  i'm happy i decided to get the plus edition of the s9 as it offers a lot of extra features for the value in addition to higher quality components and screen size and resolution. i got the 64gb because the 128gb was out of stock.  but there's an expandable memory bay in the s9+ which allows you to add up to 1tb of storage.rating: 15/10
i am so upset right now , just receive this box there is no phone inside this box  .
it's clear now that mine arrived defective. a problem started as intermittent and got worse: people couldn't hear me on speakerphone, and sometimes in handset mode too. i had a long call with tech support 3 months in, which ended in my hard-resetting the phone. the problem seemed to go away but didn't really. then i dropped the phone getting a functional, and barely visible crack. i eventually confronted the problem again, calling tech support. i mentioned the crack and they said this would not impede repair under warranty. as instructed, i brought it to ufixibreak, where i was told that a) the drop voided the warranty for all parts b) they would replace the broken part without also doing the screen even though i didn't need it done. so the cost for me was not zero but $340.when my korean car gets rear-ended, does that automatically void all the warranty on all the engine parts?i am livid and definitely won't buy a samsung again.
i read all the reviews and decided to go with the amazon shipped version of this phone to have the amazon guarantee.  a lot of reviews said this phone would not work on verizon, and that voicemail and wireless calling was not going to work.  well, all of these comments were obviously from people who didn't investigate it thoroughly.  my wireless calling works fine, my voicemail works fine and the phone works on verizon.  here is what i discovered that you will need to do if you purchase this phone if you putting it on verizon.  be sure to register an account with samsung galaxy store right on the phone and update all of your apps and when you do, it will give you samsung essentials and visual voicemail that is just like verizon's only with a blue icon instead of red.  works the same.  if you go into the settings, and turn on wireless calling, it might take a couple of tries, but it does come on, and it does work as i live in a completely shielded home where verizon's signal does not penetrate my walls or roof and my phone works perfectly over wireless.  as far as getting connected to verizon goes, all you have to do is take your sim card from your old phone and put it in the new phone.  if you have to get a new sim card from verizon because of size difference, have verizon register a new sim to your old phone, then you put it into the new phone.  these phones are approved on verizon's list of phones, but their system does not recognize the imei number and says it is not compatible and won't let the stores customer service reps scan the phone into their system.  you have to put your old sim into the new phone and then it works perfectly.  i called 611 while i was in the store and they told me how to get around their system not recognizing the imei numbers as valid.the unlocked s9+ is the best phone i have ever had..... totally happy with my purchase.
i like the phone but this one died. the other 2 are working great.  the exchange is slow especially when you need your phone. still haven't got the replacement.
i bought two of these for the kids. we went to a sprint store to get them activated and switched over from the old phones. both needed a sim card installed, only 5 bucks each so no big deal there. these s9's were upgrades from our s6 and note5 which did not use sim cards.they have both been in use for a few weeks now and i have not heard any complaints.  they look nice and the battery seems to last all day if fully charged.buying them on amazon means no re-upping my sprint contract, which is good because i prefer to minimize my commitments to any contract.
i've been wanting a samsung s series phone since the s4. i finally bit the bullet and bought the factory unlocked s9 and i couldn't be happier with a phone! there are very minor, minor things about it that are hardly worth mentioning that bug me, such as not having an emoji search function (see? not even worth mentioning), but omg i'm in love with this thing.  i'm officially a convert.  it's worth every penny.  make sure its factory unlocked! otherwise you won't be able to update the os.phone came beautifully packaged brand new with charger and headphones.
this is my first time buying an unlocked phone online and i feel like i got more than i bargained for. the super amoled screen is hands down one of the best i have seen on a smartphone and i am enjoying it very much. same goes for the speakers.in addition to that, i got to ""pixelize"" my phone, download tons of apps, files and i have to say i have not suffered from the infamous samsung lag, but if it does slow down at one point, samsung does have a function to test, diagnose and optimize your phone so i plan on taking advantage of that in the future.i'm also very satisfied with the battery. i'm a heavy user and so far it has been lasting me for a full day whereas my previous phone needed to be charged twice per day.as for the camera, i have yet to fully test what it's capable of, but i've taken a few low light pictures and have been quite impressed by how nice they looked.all in all this is a great phone and definitely a worthy purchase.
this phone was not compatible with sprint network. we spent half our day at 2 different sprint stores in an attempt to activate this phone. i also purchased a otterbox case and screen protector which i am losing $15 on becuase seller is charging me for the return.
several reviews said this unlocked phone would be fine with boost mobile.  took it into a boost store and the lady behind the counter was really nice and she tried and tried and could not get it to work with boost.  even though boost sells this exact same phone.... hmm...  nice gimmick, boost.  she did say the phone was sprint compatible.  boost is owned by sprint and its phones will run on the sprint network.  so, what gives boost?
phone beeps and shuts down broken phone
everything is great on this phone, but one thing. the touch! apparently, it is a known issue that the s9 and s9plus have horrible touch sensitivity issues. you can't type two words without wanting to throw the phone across the room. and it is in every app. even the screen pattern to unlock makes me want throw it down and cry. i hate this phone that i buy this year for black friday, got it the next day and less than 3 weeks later, i want my money back. wait or the 10 to come out.
the box i received didn't have a phone in it. it seems that it has happened to other people who bought this product looking at other reviews. in the box i only had a cheap plastic phone case. there was no accessory in it or anything.
i used to buy cheaper moto g phones i'm glad i finally bought something decent. the display is impressive and the bar at the top it more appealing to the eye than the notch on the iphone xr and xs or the pixel 3. camera is really good to and takes some impressive shots. i get a full day out of the battery using a mix of maps, camera and streaming music (normally for most of the day). the inclusion of wired akg head phones is nice and the headphone port means there is compatibility with a range or portable amplifiers. i don't get why this isn't on other phones as not having it really limits your choice in headphones or you have to have a dac/amp comb. sound quality is good i from the onboard dac/amp but i don't know about driving and thing larger than in ears. bixby is ok, i tend to use googles assistant if i need to. having the sd card slot is nice and allows for easy upgrade of the storage and for me to easily pull images i want to work on using my mac from the phone with out having to mess around with bluetooth or file transfer.
great screen, fast processor, beautiful phone.  camera is amazing.  must say, after 10+ years of being an iphone fan, this s9 kicks my old iphone's rear.  love the functionality, smart design, and flexibility.  and almost half the price of an iphone. took me about two weeks to get used to android, but it is so much more useful than mono-button. over-controlling ios.  great phone and great operating system.  i am a convert!
i would give it 5 stars if it gave me my phone case but other than that, this is a wonderful device. i was actually a little disappointed in the size because i was expecting it to be taller and a little bit wider but i got use with it so far. i use a sansung j7 so i am used with widescreen but other than that i love the new phone, i can finally use 4g wifi~
only att branded phones have wifi calling and visual voicemail by att.  do not get unlocked phones if you are on att. you will eventually regret it because there are many other features that att keeps for their own phones.
i am having issues with my unlocked s9 model sm-g960u.  the hardware i received is perfectly fine and in fact the s9 is probably the most beautiful phone i've ever laid eyes on and its a damn shame that i am going to be returning this one.  i bought mine from jd electronics at an amazing price of 563$. however, i would gladly have paid more for a phone with no issues.  i've received numerous error messages and quirks that lead me to believe this phone has been region locked or has an incompatible firmware.software update: one of the first things i tried to do with this phone was downloading updates for it.  when you navigate to settings > software update > download updates manually | the phone displays ""registering device"" and then ""processing failed.""samsung pay: when i try to open it says ""access to smasung pay has been denied. unauthorized modifications have been made to your device"" this means somehow the ""knox counter"" has been tripped on this device, which supposedly detects when someone roots it.  the next time i tried to open it says samsung pay is not supported on this device.  a samsung!region: after experiencing these quirks i went to settings > about phone | where i discovered the region is set to united arab emirates.  why would that be? the product even said united state warranty in the description?bixby:  when i swipe left to bixby home, scrolling down to the news cards ""newsroom"" ""youtube"" ""yahoo"" etc... all display headlines in chinese and take me to chinese websites.  the language is set to english in phone and bixby settings.samsung +: after experiencing much slower youtube speeds over mobile data than my previous s7 active, i downloaded samsung+ to do a speed test.  when i navigate to samsung+ > diagnostic tools > connection speed test > mobile > start speed test | it says ""connected to at&t lte network, displays a ping reading for a few seconds, then says ""test cancelled"".samsung smart switch: samsung smart switch will not recognize my device, saying it is incompatible.all of theses quirks lead me to beleive something is seriously defective or incompatible about my version of this phone.  i can't download software updates. i can't connect to smart switch on pc.  i am having serious anxiety over this purchase and warn anyone from buying such an expensive item from a third party seller.  i put a return/refund request to jd electronics and have not heard back from them yet.  will update this if they contact me.
if your a android person this phone will please you undoubtedly. my favorite feature is the camera, but despise the dedicated bixby button on the left side beneath the volume. heard you can customize it and make it into whatever you want instead of bixby, which i'm going to have to look further into as that's my only pet peeve with this phone.
purely impressed!  an amazing piece of hardware from samsung which - to me - excels in all things hardware related, and this is no exception.  there is not a single element of the hardware (screen, battery, size, ports, camera, hardware specifications, resilience, and so forth) that isn't outstanding on paper or in action.  the added customization, openness,  and versatility of the android os is welcomed compared to apple's ios.the added versatility of the unlocked version is nice if a carrier switch or something of that sort is possible, but may inhibit certain carrier exclusive features depending on the carrier (like digital voicemail).my only minor complaint is of all the samsung apps, software, and features (bloatware?) that is crammed into the phone and semi-forces its use.  a lot it seems like more of sales pitch rather than adding any value.  *cough*  the ""bixby button""...  *cough*  i feel this is samsung's weak-point with its mobile offerings at the moment.as an aside, this is my first android phone, after having all iphones.  i decided to switch to the galaxy s9 and android os after not liking the direction apple was going with its flagship phones. plus, the cutting edge features combined with sensible design choices, such as a headphone jack and touch recognition, compelled me to ""switch-sides"".  6+ months later, at the time of this review, i'm still completely satisfied with my galaxy s9.
i upgraded from an s6 so i'm pretty familiar with the s9 plus although there are changes. loved my s6 and love the s9 plus although i don't like the larger size. the only issue with this order was that i received a black s9 plus, not coral blue. not a big deal since it'll be in a case but if you have your heart set on a particular color, make sure that's what they're sending you.
i have had the phone for about 2 weeks now. for the most part, i love it. huge upgrade and so much faster than my previous s5. however, i'm not a big fan of the curved edges. i was a little hesitant to purchase this due to reviews saying the phone was missing from the box, but i am glad i did. this was the cheapest unlocked s9 that i found.  nothing was missing. this phone included the fast charge cable with block, ear buds with 3 sets of different size tips, sim card removal key, and a female usb a to a male usb c adapter to transfer data from your old phone to the new one. i will update this after i have had the phone longer but as of right now i'm a happy customer.
beautiful phone, a smooth operator. fast, slick (literally and figuratively), a fantastically marvelous piece of tech.i have returned this phone because there is this wretched little bixby button directly opposite the power button, where by squeezing the power, i invariably re-activate bixby, which was disabled per intructions.it could have been such a great phone.yes, technically i can disable the button if i sign up for a samsung account so that i can change the settings in bixby. sorry, samsung, i don't want my phone activities reporting to your mothership.
this was the best decision ever to buy this phone. the phone came in its original box with all the accessories. i turn the phone on it worked perfectly. i have metro pcs as my carrier, i try to put my old sim card in the phone it didn’t work. i went to the metro pcs store, all i had to do was register the phone and get a new sim card. i got to keep my old number, i was in that store for like 5 minutes awesome buy.
great phone!  i moved my verizon sim card from my old phone to this one and it connected immediately, no worries.
el teléfono no es original,sonido se escucha con lluvia,muy mala experiencia,the phone is not original, sound is heard with rain, very bad experience.
this phone continues to blow me away even after having it a couple days. not only does it have fingerprint and eye recognition, it has a heart rate monitor! the phone is amazingly fast and gets great signal reception, let's not mention the camera. slow motion is all i'll say.i hope it lasts 5 years like my galaxy mega before it did.contrary to some of the reviews i did receive a brand new one, sealed in the box. i had zero issues getting it put into service, the girl at the cell phone store was thrilled it was so easy as well.the headphones (earbuds) that came with it are just awesome as well, kind of like having giant speakers on your head sound quality.i couldn't be much happier with the phone, it's a great device.
nice upgrade from s8+ which is still a great phone i gave to my wife, a great deal on black friday i did't think twice so i grabbed it, i would say the most noticeable upgrade is the camera  i think its the best in the business, of course the processor is fast and snappi , display screen also is the best, i just love samsung phones imo they are the best in quality, features and adding a removable storage (micro sd card) easy to use makes them #1 choice for me
this phone is broken. buyer beware!!!!!!!!!!!! do not purchase!!!!!!!! amazon i am outraged i paid over $600 for a phone that does not work!!!!!!!!!!!
wow, this is a great phone! very fast with excellent graphics. comes with some wonderful toys. some bloatware as well, but the apps are easy to get rid of. i love the fingerprint reader and some of the other security features. and for me it's the perfect size. even with a cover it fits in my pocket and you don't have to squint to read texts. all in all, i could not recommend it more!
the phone arrive when expected. it was brand new. i took my sim card out of my old phone and put it into this one. worked like a charm. imediately switched the phone to verizon. i then proceeded to transfer everything on my old phone to new phone by usb. it came with an adapter. it was easy and took much less time than it had indicated. the camera is the bomb. a lot of options. most are pretty intuitive. one has a slider that allows you to make the background blurrier or clearer. i plan to read the manual on the others. the only think i am having trouble with is the brightness switching from inside to outside lighting. i thought i set it to adjust automatically but i have had to change it manually everytime i go outside. again hopefully the manual with have an adjustment that works. the phone is very attractive. i choose the blue one. it is not as light as it looks in the pictures but still very nice. so far the switch was easy and the pictures are great. the price was awesome. very happy with my purchase. i am telling all my friends.
arrived earlier than expected, everything was included in the box, works 100%, everything thing it was said and expected to be. this phone is worth buying.
the galaxy s9 was a replacement for an older generation galaxy that could no longer hold all of the apps i use.  my smartphone use consists primarily of voice, text, search, and gps guidance functions and an occasional photograph.  it also functions as an always available stand in for my kindle. for me, the galaxy s9 is the perfect combination of size, function, reliability and battery life.  i've wrapped it in an otterbox commuter case coupled with a magglass screen protector to help protect it against the inevitable drops and impacts it will experience over time.  it's menu system is simple and relatively intuitive although i'm sure i've missed some of its advanced functions since i haven't taken the time to download or read the full user manual. overall, i couldn't be happier with the phone.
so far so good, phone isn't a clone as far as i can tell, so that's good. came in pretty good condition, however the sim tool was loose and there are a few scratches near the top of the phone. there is also some weird white stuff on the ear piece that doesn't seem to wanna come off so i question if it's really a brand new phone. my only other issue is that for a full price phone, you would think all the accessories would be real. the headphones that come with it are a cheap vietnam knock off of the akg headphones and don't even have the akg logo on them, and they sound very muffled, and feel really cheap. the adapter for the phone charger is real, however the charging cable isn't the original samsung charging cable at all, barely even fits into the adapter (sticks out a bit). and there is no samsung seal of approval in the box, so i can only assume someone opened it, took out what they wanted and replaced it with cheap knock offs of what should be in there, and forgot to put the seal back. if i didn't need this phone so bad i would send it back and request an entirely brand new device that is completely sealed and never been opened. but my old phone is a vegetable so i can't go back to it. lastly on the possibility of a clone, the pictures that it takes look very....odd, like the quality is very low rez, again making me question if this is a ""really good"" clone. i don't recommend going through this seller by any means. 👎👎
big surprise when i received it. the box had us cellular logo on it and the phone was a sprint locked!!!!! . (found out when i gave the imei to samsung customer service). totally time and money wasting. had to return, and i bought it directly from samsung. (great phone and i'm super happy now)
bought this phone to replace an iphone 7. wife likes the phone but coming from the simplicity of the ios, this is a little more complicated. she has since gotten used to it but still struggles with advance settings.the reason for the 3 stars is it is an unlocked phones and unlocked phones do not get updates quickly. the so o. carrier locked phones have already upgraded to the pie and one ui updates but no word on when the unlocked phones will get theirs. samsung need to step up their customer service game.
i have been watching my ""non-apple"" friends for some time now... wondering, watching.  i bought a motoroloa cheapo phone just to check out the os.  how did i like the google options, the easiness of the apps, user interface?  loved it.so, i started to search for the ""real deal""  and i have been very impressed with the galaxy s9+.  the screen is unbelievably crisp.  camera?  crazy good!very happy with this phone, even happier it is unlocked so i can test the waters with different providers too.:)
i bought this phone thinking that it would be better than my current s6 edge - and just about in every way it is specially low light shots, but disappointed with the picture ai results in general.  i normally use my phone as a camera, less so as a computer or streaming device.sure wide shots look indiscernible, but once you want to see some details the s9+ images become murky at 100% zoom as the auto settings normally changes to f1.5 (no you cannot force it to use f2.4 in auto mode - which most users use)  fonts looks blotchy upon closer inspection.  yes i understand you can set it to pro mode so you can do this, but most times i use my phone to take pictures within 3 secs, no time for fiddling with settings.the s6 has a 16m native resolution at 4x3, so setting it to 16x9 reduces resolution to 12m.the 9+ has a 12m native resolution at 4x3, so setting it to 16x9 reduces resolution to 9m.quite possible this may be causing it, but i read the pixel has the same resolution but takes better photos because of the ai implementation.i normally shoot at 16x9 size settings so it fills my monitor screen and fb uploads, and this is how i compared the shots.aside from the uploaded picture, i have also compared outside scenes on both phones - and i do notice slightly murkier pictures with the s9+.in the dlsr world, sometimes you get bad lens so the logical thing is to replace the lens for a sharper one, but not everyone has this luxury with a phone specially if you are at a mobile carrier store with strict use limits.  i did a little research and found forums where people complain of the image quality as well, so i don't think i'm in the minority.
first let me say that the galaxy s9+ is a big beautiful phone. the screen is outstanding, the speed is fast and it has more features than i ever probably learn to use. definitely a first-class phone from samsung.what i really want to say is: i purchased this galaxy s9+ from the amazon warehouse at great price with an additional 20% discount. i was concerned about purchasing a used-like new phone but my son, who had previously worked at amazon, said those phones were in new condition and a great buy. he was right.the phone was without a scratch and had a clean esn. it came in the original box ( a little beat up) with all the original accessories still wrapped up. activation was no problem and it is working great. and it was half the price of a new phone! half price for a galaxy s9+! i am so happy and will recommend to my friends who are shopping for new phones to check out the amazon warehouse deals.update: i am taking off one star because i cannot get insurance on phone. amazon will not provide nor even offer insurance on own product. there are two insurance providers on amazon, squaretrade and asurion, but neither will cover used amazon phone. interestingly, the both cover used eb*y phones but amazon can't or won't get them to cover their used products. go figure???
terrible es casi un robo de 800$ no dan soluciones inmediatas , entregan los paquetes al que este no a la persona a cual va como destinatario, que seguridad dan al comprar , me han robado 800 dolares por este celular que dicen dar una explicación en 72 horas , sin asegurar que devuelvan el dinero , cuando nunca recibí el paquete nunca, tengan cuidado con estas compras por aquí.
phone having issues with recieving phone call network provider said it's not on there end. it's the phone...
it claimed to be unlocked in the title but when i received it, it only accepted verizon wireless
received the phone, was tricky to turn on with sprint, finally got it turned on, after about 6 weeks i got a black screen and the phone wouldn't power on or work in any way. amazon / samsung sent a replacement, got the replacement and its been a nightmare to turn on with sprint, in the end sprint couldn't do it, this has been a nightmare and its taken up so much of my time and energy, its stressed me out to no end. i will be canceling my amazon prime and i am done with amazon. the entire procedure for returns have been a joke and nobody was any help, also sprint & samsung have been horrible, avoid that one aswell. the phone claims to be unlocked, it is not. samsung and amazon were no help what so ever. i got different answers from everyone every time i contacted them. stay away from this phone and do not buy cell phones on amazon.
the phone appears to be okay and is working fine, i'm just weary of it being a previously returned product due to the torn open packaging.
if you are on the fence about what you want in a phone, i highly recommend samsung brand, but also specifically either this phone, or the samsung s9+.  my mom got this phone after years of using a s4 and her transition was very smooth.  although this phone has a lot of bangs and whistles, i think she has gotten used to using it far faster than we thought she would.  she is taking and sending pictures a lot more than she ever has before, and has even figured out how to use some of the other basic functions that she would not have used before.  she is very happy with her purchase, and would recommend this product.  samsung has done a wonderful job with developing their product.  i personally have the + and i think the only real difference, is screen size.  either way, you will be happy with this!
now this phone would be the ideal phone for a younger person or ppl with small fingers and can see will. since i’m either the reason for the stars. i went from a iphone 6 plus to this and have wanted to busted it up every since. it’s not the phones fault. it’s mine because i can’t see it well and my fingers are to big to text correctly. i’m always hitting button i didn’t mean to and have to erase and retype most of my text. maybe should have went with the plus size. the volume is a little low for my hearing and i didn’t think my hearing was bad. i find sometimes i have to hold it up to my ear to hear somethings. i don’t know if it me or the phone. the battery life i have to charge it every night. i am not a person to stay on my phone all day. just general text,facebook and maybe play a game for a bit. there maybe things i can turn off to extend the battery which i have turned to youtube for some advise but i still didn’t find anything to help extend the battery. overall, after being so excited with getting a chance to have one of these phones i am disappointed with it. i’m 41 years old so i’m not over the hill. i wish i could go back and buy the plus version. so on this one be your on judge.
bodyi am very disappointed with this mobile phone.first of all, in the united states even the network signal is so bad that a lot of software can not be used.second, cell phone battery life is very shortthe first few days of receipt can only last one day.it is not a month, full of electricity can only be used during the day.disappointing.
this phone was great the first two months i had it. after that, my screen, my apps, everything would started to freeze more often than usual. it just got to the point when i closed out, my entire phone went black and wouldn't let me back in the phone. this doesn't seem normal anymore and it hasn't fallen or anything. no sorts of damage or anything.  so i dont understand why its doing this. if you do, let me know. i spent almost $800 and that's a arm and leg for me.
i already had a samsung galaxy 9 plus, but i shattered the screen. i knew i still needed to make payments on it and didn't want to pay the full amount for another phone. i wasn't happy i had to buy used, but let me tell you when i got this in.... i'll never buy new again unless it beats a certified refurbished price from amazon! i can not believe how new it felt when i opened the box. it even had the liquid protector on! which is my only negative comment, i had a liquid on my old one when it shattered so i prefer glass so i did order that when i ordered the new one, but a protector wasn't even expected! fast delivery, exceeded my expectations!
the bixby button is a joke. worst cell phone feature ever.  if it weren't for the awful button, i might have given bixby a try.  i mean really, who wants or needs a button dedicated to opening a virtual assistant!?!?  no one that's who.  the button should have been for the camera.aside from that, great phone.  all functions work well and are generally intuitive.update: latest update allows you repurpose the bixby button, making it slightly less worthless. downside is that it forces you to keep bixby enabled.  one press let's you open an app of your choice (such as the camera app), two presses opens bixby.
i ordered the samsung galaxy s9 unlocked smartphone for my wife, she simply loves it.  it has so many smart features and all the technology you come to expect in a ""smart phone.""  it takes great pictures and with 64gb you can download countless, pics, contacts, etc.
i'm very upset over this item, i've wanted this phone for months and when i finally buy it and take it to my carrier, they can't activate it. when they put the sim card in it says ""phone not allowed"". i spent over an hour calling different numbers to figure out what was going on and the only nswer i got was that it must not be unlocked like it said it was. i called amazon support and they researched it and said  that it's supposed to work with metropcs, band they don't under why it isnt. amazonis refunding my money but it still upsets me because i had my heart set on it.
when i first bought this phone, i was a little perturbed. i bought it when it was first released, and there was an issue either with the os or spotify that ate memory, causing me to have to reboot it every night. there has since been a software update which fixed the issue (issue was fixed after a samsung update, not a spotify update, so i think it was them), and now the phone is great.amazing memory. no need to clear out old apps or photos or videos. runs fast with no issues. and even if you did start to have a problem, there's a built in system optimizer so you don't have to download an app that's actually going to make it worse.the only issue i have is with the ""edge"" feature. it does not integrate well with a lot of social media, so some pictures (ex instagram stories) are cut off on the sides.
i am so angry. i got a ""dummy"" phone it does not even want to turn on and the best part is it isn't even a samsung s9.i brought this phone with me to australia as a gift for my dad and i am furious only to open the box and get this phone. i want my money back.
i have had this phone for a few months now ,and i love it. i recently switched from an iphone 6 to this phone so that i would have better picture quality. i did not want to break the bank buying an iphone x, so i found this phone for an amazing price instead. even though this phone is a verizon wireless phone, i was able to use it with my at&t plan. i am very impressed with the battery life! the only thing that sucks about an android is i cannot text through wifi when i don't have have cell signal like i could with my iphone. i would buy from this seller again.
best you can get from samsung currently, comes with everything you would expect from a flagship: uhd amoled display, water and dust resistance, wireless charging, iris and fingerprint scanners, fast charging included in the box, headphone jack and a pair of nice akg earbuds,microsd slot for expanded storage etc. fast, snappy and stylish. its samsung's flagship phone and iphone's main competition for a reason. the only ""bad thing"" i would say is that if you already have an s8 then the s9 is not worth the upgrade.
phone is very sluggish and non responsive to touch most of the time.
purchased the phone on cyber monday and all was great for the first like 3 weeks.  then periodically the phone would stop charging, saying that there was water in the charging outlet when there wasn't.  after a while it just stopped charging entirely unless using a wireless charging port.  mind you, we've had the phone for less than 2 months at this point.  sent the phone into samsung and they said the phone was out of warranty.  we specifically chose the phone option with a warranty, which cost more, for this reason.  currently on the phone with amazon and my partner's talking to samsung to see what our options are, what a complete waste of time.
the speaker distorts really bad when the music is at high volume. the reason i bought this was for the camera and the new speakers. the camera's front flash when on whatsapp conversations does not work. if you need to send someone a picture, you have to go the the camera itself, take the picture then go back into whatsapp to send it. i mean its not a huge deal but i'd like if the front flash worked in whatsapp. all in all, good phone but mehhh!
i was so nervous about getting this phone after reading some of the reviews, but i'm happy to say i've had it almost a month so far and still no complaints. i use verizon towers through straight talk and had no issue setting it up myself. it is all glass so i recommend a nice case and screen protector. the camera is amazing and the set up is really nice. i also loved that it didn't come with all the random apps that i never used on my old phones.
when i called samasung tech support about the s9+ muffled quality of the phone's microphone (complaints from people i've called), i discovered, from samsung, there was only 5-months of warranty remaining. the phone is supposed to have a 1-year warranty.calling amazon, they now tell me that the warranty began when they took possession of the phone, not when i take possession of the phone. now, samsung includes all the warranty information in the packaging, however amazon doesn't deem it necessary to provide clear-and-full disclosure of this important bit of information. this lack of full disclosure could be extremely expensive. to be clear, you're getting a perfectly new phone from amazon but...without the full warranty.i am, of course returning the phone. sad, that i have been very pleased with amazon for a long time only to discover this lack of clear disclosure in the packaging. i am well aware the phone has a 1-year warranty, but you must dig through the fine print to find this is not true if purchased through amazon. if your new phone is sitting on a shelf in their warehouse, then your warranty is slowly expiring.after discovering this, i had no interest in trouble shooting a problem with the s9+ micorphone which turns out to not be compatible with the new, higher-quality, high-security standard of volte phone calling. with the s9+, you're paying for this feature on this next generation phone -- though samsungs product, here, is flawed. samsung's work around is to deactivate your 4g volte feature. this means audio and video calls are reverted back to the fuzzy dark ages.
i bought this for my dad to activate as a verizon phone.  it is not the same phone you'd get at verizon. he spent so much time calling samsung and they told him this-this phone will not have the identical capabilities as what you'd buy at verizon. specifically, the video call feature with another android, and will not using wifi for calls if you don't have cell service. these are two big things that doesn't make sense to go without when you pay this much for a phone.  so upset.
so if the phone worked i'd give it 4 or 5 stars but not being able to charge by wire is a very big bug apparently not too uncommon for this phone.  i can charge it wirelessly, i can connect the phone to my laptop and perform the samsung smart switch backup process, but for some unknown reason it fails to charge through the usb port.  service to samsung has been above average but its outsourced overseas scripted help - this takes extra time spent try to explain the symptoms and get the desired support.  naturally with a suspect hardware error i now have the undesirable task of shipping the phone to them, waiting for it to be repaired/replaced, and then waiting for the return,  from what i'm told that sounds like a two week turnaround.  this is a flagship phone.  samsung is a big seller of these phones.  support should be much stronger imho - such as accelerated return and repair for such a new phone.battery life has been good, wifi and bluetooth have been solid and aren't draining my battery, screen look great, find the bixby button to be in an annoying location often accidentally pressed and then more time wasted to cancel it.  have had no system locks or unexpected reboots unlike my former platform.  wish it did other things that the last phone did such as hands free txt while driving.  the email apps i've used thusfar leave desirable room for improvements such as the ability to place email folders at the home screen - less clicks to see stuff.
i got my unlocked samsung galaxy s9, it works with cricket wireless! just plugged in my sim card and it works perfectly. very happy with my purchase. i purchased this phone with amazon, i was thinking about purchasing it with a third party seller because it's cheaper, however i didn't feel like risking anything so i chose not to. so far i love the phone!
the true color of this device (coral blue) isn't well represented in cook position to real life. the phone is soooooo much richer in color. the device isn't too long and fits decently in my hand. android got a real big overhaul from what i remember years ago since my s4 and s2. it doesn't seem to be a real sacrifice switching from an iphone 6s. bixby button down he do much for me so i disabled it within a week. only things i would like like to see is a texture back bverson of these devices...yes there are skins to apply but having an alternative would be nice...
this phone is great. not cheap,but a bad pick for me. i did not need this much phone. all these features i probably never use. i also have a samsung tv and i must say it was easy doing the screen mirroring thing. netflix from my phone to tv. so the phones great and i give it five stars, but being new to smart phones i bought more phone than i need and would not buy it again.
got this on sale for a good deal and i am impressed with the sound quality, the camera, pretty much everything. i was replacing an s5 so i was a bit behind on the phones. it was easy to set up, i just had to visit my verizon store and buy a sim card because the s5 wouldn't work. it was around $10 bucks. comes with headphones and a handy device that lets you port all of your stuff from your old phone, into the new one. overall, i am satisfied with this phone, hopefully it lasts me as long as the s5 did!
the galaxy s8 plus battery was great, this feels like a major step backward, as i needed to charge the phone at least 3 times just to get through 8-5.there are also major software problems too: the vpn simply refused to function after switched from wi-fi to cellular, requiring manual disconnect and reconnect to the vpn. my office has several wi-fi dead spots, as you can see it can get frustrating very quickly. samsung support is virtually useless, they kept on saying it is not a problem.now the good: camera is phenomenal, the best out there; performance is light years ahead of the s8, i don't even see the stuttering in the google play store, that's how smooth the phone is.overall, solid phone hindered by poor battery life and my personal issue with vpn according to samsung, so i decided to deal with it as a customer who has an issue with the product: returning it. guess i would use the s8 one more year.
i got this phone on black friday with fancy price. i was hoping this will be a good choice but i think i made bad choice.  here are the reasons1. phone signal: the phone displays very bad signal with att provider. i thought it will be provider issue and talked to them. they said this model has issues.2. no wifi calling option: this model is not usa att phone variant so this is not compatible with wifi calling. wifi calling helps when the signal is almost no or very weak. we can connect to the wifi and then use that to make calls. this is completely gone. i had note-5 and it was having good signal and wifi on same places.3. calls dropping: called the provider and they said same. it is the model issue and not sim card issue4. after all these hassles, called att and asked for replacement sim and adding the replacement sim did not help.these are all the reasons that i dont recommend this to others. i am also going to call amazon and see what options do i have to return.
wow. after 3 days of using (without a single drop) i've noticed the camera's glass cover is cracked. next day i am already having dust particles under it. quick google and i see i am not the only one (there are many). i've noticed this last night after i left a warm building and on the outside it was pretty cold. the funny thing is that many other users with this problem noticed that the temperature difference might be the problem. and yeah, most of them have owned their samsung phones for only few days/weeks too. so it seems like if it doesn't happen to you in few weeks/months after buying then you are safe. i am extremely disappointed. i own old iphone se, nexus 5 and iphone 4 where the last one is being used by my kid as a toy (!!) and non of these have broken either front glass or camera glass.
i was an apple fan but since ios phones were getting so expensive every year i decided to give samsung a try, which was a huge mistake. dont get me wrong this is a nice looking phone the battery is great i can go one full day without charging it, heavy user. the screen resolution is awesome and the sound is great. but after 4 months my s9+ started to slow down and now it just doesn't respond at all.  the screen frequently freezes and and goes completely blank. i try to turn it on and off but it doesn't work and a message appears on my screen (i have attached a pic of the message).  i think i may go back to ios.
ordered the phone and noticed during setup that the phone didn't quite ""feel"" like a flagship phone should...i ended up googling how to tell if it was fake or not and found a video confirming it was....i started the return process i'll update when it's taken care ofedit: still upset about the whole situation, but amazon took care of return in a timely manner....so....there's that.
i ordered two of the galaxy s9+ phones at 256gb. when they arrived, they were the wrong ones at 128gb. this is something to be mindful of before you activate it with a carrier. i use my own straight talk. even though they were the wrong phones, i decided to keep them anyway just because i already went through the process of switching it over to straight talk. the phones work great and i am happy for that. not happy that they are not the 256gb like i paid for.
me vendieron el producto versión europeo cuando se realizó la compra por uno americano , traje mi teléfono a ecuador y no puedo hacer uso de garantía a pesar de que es un fallo de fábrica
in rare amazon fashion, this multiple-hundred dollar item was shipped with zero packaging to protect the phone box. pretty disappointing, fortunately everything with the phone was fine. but if i order something that is several hundred dollars, i expect there to be at least a degree of packaging - not just loose in the big cardboard box.the phone itself is outstanding! i went from a galaxy s4 to an s9. i had my old one 6 years i loved it so much, but i'm glad i finally upgraded.
wow, what a huge step up from my galaxy s7 edge. all day battery, even with hours of screen time. apps load quickly and run smoothly. firefox loads web pages quickly.the camera opens quickly, and takes picture quickly. my old s7 would sometimes take several tries to open the camera and then take up to 10-15 seconds before it was ready to take a picture and longer for a video.pictures are definitly much better than my old s7 edge.all in all a nice upgrade.
the phone itself and shipping was fine, but the phone did not come with anything but the phone itself and it is not unlocked for usa. sprint said it was an international phone and could not be added to our network.
after reading all the ""single starred"" reviews i was getting worried about my purchase. as soon as it booted up though, all my doubts vanished! the phone is so much more better than my old phone! i was using a blu phone with only 8gbs of internal storage and really wanted an upgrade. and what an upgrade it was! the camera quality is splendid, the performance is remarkable, and the transition was smooth as silk. the battery life is hindered due to the always on function and the already implanted apps that run among samsung's internal storage,but it doesn't bother me that much. i'm still learning of it's many capabilities, but all in all i'm not disappointed with it yet.
after launching my pixel 2 xl out of the passenger window in a fit of rage, i needed a new phone. i guess i didn't feel like rating the ""waze"" app with 5 stars in heavy traffic. anyways... i didn't really have too many requirements, the new phone needed a great camera and a display that wasn't smashed into 1349 pieces.this s9+ will be a hard phone to replace. the display is deep. the camera is arguably the best on the current market. even bixby can be disabled. it's not perfect but it's my daily driver for the moment.
so excited! i received the phone today and it is amazing. it was very easy to set up. it has many new features (i had a samsung7 and liked it) and the typing is more comfortable, because the screen is larger.i use verizon, called them and they switched me in a short time to the new phone without a visit to the store. i put it on the charging stand i had for the s7, no problem. so far i am very happy with my choice.one week later: i love my new phone! still discovering new features. as a former photographer, i am afraid that the photo industry will take an other hit (film to digital) by the quality of the camera on this phone. excellent in every way!
there are other reviewers who know a lot more about the technical aspects of the phone. i can say that my experience has been positive. i previously owned a samsung galaxy s5, so this was a significant upgrade for me. i love the look and feel of the phone. it's fast and responsive. i no longer feel like i have to delete every unnecessary app to keep the phone from freezing up and crashing. the battery lasts all day without charging (i used to have to charge multiple times with my s5 and if i was using heavily, i was tethered to power constantly or it would die). i am satisfied with the sound quality. i listen to a lot of music and podcasts. anyone who has used samsung phones in the past should have no problem adapting to this phone.i love the finger print and face recognition to unlock the phone and various apps. i also used the samsung pay feature for the first time today and that was fun and easy.  i do wish that i could get the home screens to wrap the way they did on my old phone, but that's the only thing i can think of that my s5 had that i can't do on this phone (and it's very minor).
this came brand new completely wrapped in plastic down to the sides of the phone.  the people complaining about it being used clearly bought from a 3rd party seller. i bought from amazon and it was definitely the unlocked model that works on cdma and gsm.  my wife loves her new phone and the new one ui made it easier to switch from apple. it came with all accessories also wrapped.
bought this for my wife in aug 2018, used for three months so far. she complains almost everyday because the phone is stuck and gets dumb for a while. she needs to reboot the device almost everyday. software upgrades are frequent but the problem exists. i want to replace this.
i do not recommend getting this, or any samsung device due to the sheer amount of crapware they install. it is impossible to remove this, without significantly changing the structure of the operating system.a few examples include: galaxy themes, requiring a samsung account, remapping the samsung voice assistant (bixby) is extremely difficult, and breaks between updates.one positive is dex. samsung's desktop expericence is actually really cool.in conclusion, this is a very nice piece of hardware made very annoying by all of samsung's attempts to ""improve"" on stock android functionality. i will never made the mistake of buying another samsung device again.
i like the fact that this factory unlocked galaxy s6 plus phone is not dedicated to any one carrier. you do not get the non removable junk they install. it fired up immediately and has worked well since. one problem i noticed is that after 48 hours if the unit is operating 24/7, i need to restart it due to clutter. even when i close all applications after use.get this one. it is excellent.
this was on sale more than $100 off for black friday weekend, so it was a no-brainer to get the unlocked phone from amazon with prime shipping (it arrived less than 36 hours after ordering it) rather than from samsung's website for the same price and slower (not free) shipping. i love the phone and desperately needed a new one. the phone is fantastic and super fast. i love it.
i decided to buy a warehouse deal due to the price.  i can't even tell it was ""very good"" condition.  looks brand new.  works perfectly.  battery life great.  picture quality is stunning.  i can't find one complaint at all.
liked the discounted price during holiday pricing. phone is great, fast, cameras are good enough. feels good in hand, screen is perfect size, sound is great for a phone device. coming from galaxy note 3 for which i paid 150 brand new. this is huge upgrade but still not worth 5 times higher price than what phones  used to  cost. phone manufacturers have to understand that. please stop overpaying for phones and make them to lower prices. it's not normal that cell phone costs 1000, period
still don't know how to use everything.  but screen is good, clarity of sound.  good pics and easy video.  but i haven't figured out all the settings and really get annoyed because it is far to easy to trip the selfie setting and often miss shots because i accidentally touched something.  also need to figure out the telephoto, it works great when i accidentally use it : )
a year ago, i went with a moto g5 plus with amazon's special offers. that phone was great. excellent battery life, and an almost stock version of android. only downside was the cheap glass screen which cracked not even a month after i had it, and the mediocre pic quality. this time around, amazon had a deal with the s9 and a free echo show (which i was able to hock on ebay). i was expecting leaps and bounds vs my old moto. however i've been  somewhat disappointed. 1. the battery life sucks on this phone! i find myself having to throw it on a charger otherwise it will barely make it through a full day. 2. the fingerprint scanner is garbage compared to the moto. i personally prefer the scanner on the front, but the s9 seems to have a delay that can be frustratingly annoying after a while. and yes i've taken multiple scans and re-scans of my prints. it does take nice pictures, and i love wireless charging and the secure folder feature. other than that, i'm still on the fence. i may just send this one back to amazon and order a g6.
really glitchy. constantly freezes. still can't find a screen protector and case that works for it. paid too much for it and didnt even get the original box and accessories.
this phone was purchased for my mom. she's had a flip lg phone for the longest time. she never wanted a smart phone. her phone started giving her problems, so i purchased this one for her. now i don't think she will ever go back lol. she loves everything about it once she had everyone figured out. now she's on it more than i am! i would highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for alot of storage and great camera features. it's the perfect size too. not too big and not too small. she loves it! i'm actually planning on getting the same one!
the first week worked great then started to freeze, and now over heating. i have had this for about 6 months. already sending in to repair.
so disappointed in this purchase order the phone and it does not work. standard settings aren't working.
the product arrived in good condition however the model number on the box and the sticker attached to the phone were different than the model numbers in the product specifications on the amazon web site. i purchased this phone because it was advertised to work on my carrier, which is verizon. i took the phone to verizon and the told me this phone will not work in their system. i will be returning this product.
this was a replacement for my 5 year old blackberry. i have used blackberry phones for 15 years, so the transition was challenging and at first it seemed as if i had made the wrong choice. but, after successfully transferring all of my files and apps to the galaxy and setting up the new apps, it was easy to transition to a new way of doing things. i love it now, but i have to admit i like the physical keyboard better, but gboard is not bad. p.s. i share membership in the greatest generation.
previously my phone was a samsung galaxy grand prime. i upgraded to the s9+ after about 4 years of use with the grand prime. this upgrade was worth it. my provider (cricket wireless) works with it and the picture, camera, and sound quality is phenomenal!! the best things that i like about it include the fingerprint scanner, the ability to shoot 4k video (limited to 5 minutes though), as well as the extensive amount of tools that can be utilized such as their network settings, the integration with google and samsung, and paired with a good screen protector and case, the durability. the only downside i could say is the battery through continuous usage. however at a decent set brightness, the phone can last almost at a full 24 hours using the optimized battery usage setting.
very disappointed.  purchased from amazon warehouse and apparently the phone was not inspected as the device was locked for use.  also,  i noticed an abnormal battery drain and that's only on wifi; imagine how much worse the battery would be with a sim card and data signal.  i'm giving another 3rd party a chance,and honestly i'm not really optimistic .  amazon provided me a courtesy credit which was nice; however, there's no real way of knowing if the seller is blacklisted.
great phone, arrived in perfect condition and well packaged, originally from t-mobile but it's unlocked so it worked perfectly fine and instantly picked up 4g lte.
i switch from apple (6s+) and i'm really happy i did. i love this phone so much. i thought i would have to relearn how to use an entirely new phone, however it was super easy to use. i does a lot of cool stuff and takes really nice pictures! the phone arrived sooner than expected shipping to an apo address.
this unit apparently is not packaged with a sim card or a removal tool.  since it is unlocked, you can just move your present card over and it starts right up.  i had a removal tool left in the box for my old phone.  this phone looks and feels great!  i don't have experience yet with its features and operations but maybe i can speak for that later.
just got this phone in the mail today and it is not a new phone. i am pretty disappointed because there is nothing in the description to indicate that it is not new. i have no idea about this phone's history. does it have water damage? is the battery going to be old and not stay charged as long?  thinking i might just send it back.
i just received my phone and i ordered an unlocked one that should be the g965u1 model but i received a g965f/ds model and i'm so frustrated about it!! it doesn't work with verizon network and the charger doesn't fit in us power plugin!!
its been almost 3 weeks since i had this and so far i feel this might be the greatest samsung phone ever the speed is insane fast, quality is amazing, the battery is based off how much you use it overall i can go one full day without charging it and that's if i use it all the time if i dont more than a day if you get this phone and experience battery drain quickly watch youtube videos that was the 1st thing i did as soon as i got it to optimize it
i've had it for 7 months now and i must say it keeps up to my everyday life. battery life depends on how u use it but mines typically last me for daylight and it charges in no time. from 0-100 in about 1 hour and 50 minutes the most. if you don't use your phone while it charges. seeing that the battery only lasts me for the daylight i now think the s9+ is a better buy for me because of the 500mah more of battery life... but hey i'm not taking anything away from this phone it's still awesome!
i ordered the coral blue color for the s9 phone. the item picture here shows a light blue shade however what i received is much deeper blue and hard to tell if it's blue or black unless you see it in bright light. not happy with the color i received but otherwise a great phone especially at the discounted price i got.
upgraded from the s5 to the s9, what a difference!  this phone is really fast, great camera, speakers, screen, it goes on and on.  i wasn't too sure about buying an unlocked phone on amazon, but amazon was the seller which set my mind at ease if there was an issue.  i paired my phone with a rhinoshield case and an amfilm glass screen protector, very happy with both.  great phone!  you won't be disappointed. galaxy s9 screen protector glass, amfilm 3d curved dot matrix full screen samsung galaxy s9 tempered glass screen protector (5.8"") 2018 with easy application tray (not s9 plus) (case friendly)galaxy s9 screen protector glass, amfilm 3d curved dot matrix full screen samsung galaxy s9 tempered glass screen protector (5.8"") 2018 with easy application tray (not s9 plus) (case friendly)samsung galaxy s9 case [solidsuit by rhinoshield] | shock absorbent slim design protective cover - compatible w/ wireless charging [3.5m / 11 ft. drop protection] - carbon fiber
this phone is very good.  battery life is pretty good.  i wish the standby time would be better, but that is not samsung's fault...android has poor standby battery life.  overall, i really enjoy using this phone.  i highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a feature-packed smartphone.
this phone is too large in my hand and i cannot interact with it easily as i did my 5s. screen is beautiful, os is glitchy, designated bixby button is obnoxious. i hit it in error many times. doubly annoying because i don't use bixby. camera is very nice. i've been using it for almost a month and it is very quick with a two day battery life with occasional use.
phone is great, camera is great, it is also good looking.  nevertheless, bluetooth does not work with my car (vw tiguan 2014) and apparently that is the case with many more car brands. you can check that yourself by visiting samsung's support site and looking at the countless cases relating the same issue, across a variety of car brands and models. i owned an s7 that had the same issue, and was hoping that the s9 would have addressed that. i also owned an iphone 7, that had flawless bluetooth performance. so, this is specific to samsung issue. samsung does not seem to care too much, since all those cases are poorly answered... with no solution. and remember: this has been going on since s7 (at least).. samsung couldn't care less. unfortunately i'm selling it and getting an iphone instead. too bad
i got a fake phone
i've always used cheap off brand smart phones and i'm not one who buys the latest and greatest every year, but i did break down and buy this last year when it was still a new product. there is definitely a difference between a budget phone and a top of the line samsung. i was only worried because the last samsung i had didn't last very long even though i took good care of it, but this one is still alive a strong after owning it as long as i have.
unlocked us version, as per description.  works flawlessly with mint.  battery is long-lasting, fingerprint reader is great (works well even through a thick case, can be used to secure investing and banking apps), phone is fast, good storage, has a microsd slot.i would've loved an unlocked bootloader and replaceable battery, but most folks don't care about that so i'll give it 5 stars.
it is an awesome one!!!!! now able to use it more easy yeah. the battery is lasting me much longer, if i do not use it all the time, i do not need to charge it until the the next. is is easy to set it up and get all your data back on.
i'm in love with this phone. i was really hesitating between this samsung that had amazing reviews or (yet again) buy a new iphone. i used to think iphones were the best smartphones on the market. well, i'm happy to say i was proved wrong. this phone is really impressive, it works really smoothly and has an amazing camera, even for rookies like me. don't regret the change from iphone!
the galaxy s9 arrived in perfect condition, with all included accessories (purchased from sales pro 55). the phone itself is beautifully designed. the glass on the back is prone to fingerprints and not grippy at all, so a case is recommended. the fast charging works flawlessly and does make up for the slightly smaller battery on the s9 model (in comparison to the s9+). the performance is fast and snappy, and with samsung releasing one ui in january, i'm anticipating continued fast performance in 2019. overall, i would recommend this phone, but please be cautious of third-party sellers. look at ratings before picking one.
i bought this phone thinking it was a us model but is was not or it was a fake. i have since bought a real us model and it was very different from the ar emojis to whats in the box. to top it all off the mobile data wont work on the phone. after hours with tec support it still would not work. the real phone has android pie  this one came with a prior version of andriod.
i was nervous buying this from an amazon seller but now that i have had the phone a few days i am very pleased.battery got hot the first charge but has been fine ever since. accubattery app shows that the battery is working well. beautiful design, vivid color and for less than you would get it from verizon, anywhere else. especially if you have prime!!
i bought this s9+ last april and i have spent a month trying to reach customer support via amazon and no luck. the screen is burnt in and i read online that this is a common issue with the phone, and warranty applies. i hope by this mean i can be reached by a customer support representative since amazon is not so helpful in this opportunity.
my old s5 died so i finally broke down and got a new and holy cow, this difference is huge. the phone is wonderful. looks good and is sleek. all the new features are great. the camera is amazing. i can't tell you how much i love it, definitely worth it
i was considering the iphone x - but after reading the pros and cons of each phone on *reputable* websites, i went with this *awesome*  unlocked samsung galaxy s9+  it is super fast and exceeds all of my expectations and no verizon bloatware! the camera and iris scanner work incredibly well!
great phonegreat priceexactly what i wanted
recently bought during a promo to trade in old phone. phone i received was a duel sim and box is in spanish. which does not work for the trade in.
i am not a huge samsung fan, but this phone has proven fantastic. got the phone right away and it was easy to set up. i use total wireless with no problems at all.  great battery life.
phone arrived in full working order, with the model in description. tested good on at&t network (although i did have to have customer service reset the sim and program it appropriately - keep this in mind if your mobile data doesn't work right away - the stores don't always do what they should)very happy with the phone.
the emei for the phone showed up on at&t's list as ""unknown manufacturer"".  spent 4+ hours on the phone with at&t and talked with 5 representatives, but if it isn't on their list it won't work.  the emei was listed as ""samsung"" on other external emei lists, but at&t's internal list is the one that matters to at&t.
sadly this phone did not work with verizon but the folks at the store said at&t may be able to unlock it. so i went there and they found out it still had a payment due on it from a previous owner!! so obviously it's not new. and not able to be unlocked for my use. unusable. sent it back.  :(
the phone is ok if you are used to samsung... their software addons get annoying because it is basically the same as google.the phone is very fragile and the backing easily cracks... even with a case
i'm not really into always buying the latest and greatest tech, which is why i bought the s9 at a decent discount as the s10 has been recently released.  i replaced my s6 active with this s9 and i am very impressed.  the s9 performs well with daily task.  with 1 charge, i usually have around 30% battery at the end of the day with moderate use.  i've had the s9 for about 3 month now with 0 issues and i dont regret my purchase.
i ordered samsung galaxy s9 plus unlocked and none of the sim cards worked. i'm assuming it's locked. i don't know if it's just a mistake or they mean to trick people
good price for amazon prime users. also tv is great. one thing, buy a good protector !! also buy as much memory as possible so as too send photos too. fast phone and lots of apps. dont pay for iphone, the $$$$$ is too high. great pics and amazon app to send pics to computer is a great addition. as a old fart it took me time to look at all the apps. oh, get a good security program too. well worth the $$ for amazon prime members, mine was un-locked. just a footnote, most isp will have free downloads for security programs, yes, for the phone also
best phone i ever had. liked it so well, i bought another one for my wife. working great in the philippines.
this has been the worst phone i have ever owned. i have to turn it off and restart it at least 3 times a day.
got scared when i was reading the reviews after i already bought this because people were saying they only got a box, or the phone stopped working, or stuff was missing. but i am assuming these were all purchased from other sellers or refurbished or used. amazon has all reviews from different sellers lumped into one. got mine new from amazon.com services inc. seller and it came with everything, including fast charger box and cable and headphones. phone has been working excellent, great battery life.
i was a bit skeptical because i saw a few reviews saying they received fake phones, refurbished phones or empty boxes. happy to say i received a brand new real s9. works great and works with metro pcs service.
ordered this unlocked galaxy s9+ on cyber monday.  got it for under $500.  read a lot of the reviews on here and many said they got used phones or they weren't unlocked.  i took a chance and bought one anyways since i knew i could return it if it wasn't new or unlocked.  i couldn't pass it up for under $500.  mine arrived and it was brand new and unlocked!  i took my verizon sim card out of my s7 edge and put it in the s9+ and powered it up and the phone had to do a quick download from verizon and another reboot and then the phone was up and running.  i really notice the speed difference with the extra 2gb of ram vs. the s7.  hope this helps with anyone considering purchasing these unlocked phones and happy holidays!
worst experience ever. i bought this phone june 26, 2018 and today aug 28, 2018 the damn phone no longer work. plug it in nothing no charging absolutely nothing so i lost my 840 just like that... i am so disappointed
i bought this phone, read reviews and the answers to the question if it worked on verizon, everyone said it does....well it doesnt. i took it into the verizon store after i couldn't get it to work, apparently it's the wrong antenna (verizon is cdma and this isn't). be careful
i like the screen like everyone else does and also the music sounds good. battery life is surprising good better than expected. but beware that you lose some options from from your service provider buying an unlocked phone. also a bit too pricey but if you can afford it go for it...
a really great high-end phone, i love how clear it captures pictures in bright or in dark areas thanks to the dual aperture,the most important thing for me in a smartphone is its display quality which this gets right with its gorgeous displaysound is also very good on the studio speakers
came with an 86% charge and a screen protector on?? feel like it might not be brand new but besides that it's been perfect. it is originally  at&t and needs the smaller sim card luckily i bought a cheap phone while waiting and it had the right size sim card.... the only thing is the battery doesn't seem right... it dropped 10% after one hour of use but it's still the first day. could easily just be all the updates and crap
came perfect, well shipped and in original manufacturers packaging. i just had to take the sim card from my previous (windows) phone and insert it into the s9+ holder. configuration was very easy, i was new to this but i was 100% successful.
samsung ""as always"" takes you above and beyond, i'm impressed with the quality of the phone and the many services that are designed to make you feel comfortable and connected. as for bixby, i like google assistant more, but it is good to have both services in one phone. i'm planning to leave the us and i'm not sure that the phone would be ok or locked for us providers only.
the box came with seemingly everything except the phone. this is a ton of money to spend to find out this is a scam.
great phone. upgraded from s5 and this is much better. i like the wireless charging and it has a long battery life. much faster cpu and memory. very responsive. more storage and sd card can be added as well. more comfortable in the hand and easier to use. highly recommend if you have a s5,6, or maybe 7. if anything newer, you should probably get the s10.
bought just after price drop.  phone worked great, new in box as advertised.  no issues as some have claimed about returned/open box items.  can't beat the features for the price either.
i've seen various reviews before buying saying that they received only the phone w/nothing else on the box so when i ordered mine i was kind of scared to only receive the phone but i read to make sure what was in the box and it included everything the phone came w/ and i am now typing this on the new phone. i got everything and you should too. great phone and its performance is amazing.
i purchased the ""new condition"" phone and it came in very mint condition and in its original samsung box with all its accessories (i.e. akg ear buds, usb cord, usb connector, wall charger, sim card ejector pin, instructions and manual). i am very satisfied with my purchase and i plan on purchasing another as a gift.
i got the regular s9 with 128gb. the screen is curved and it is real fun to watch to videos on phone. the sound quality is amazing. its powerful enough like some of the portable speakers. beats iphone any day. camera is fabulous. pictures are crystal clear and true hd.some drawbacks - pictures take lot of storage space. i installed a sd card. but its wierd - sometimes the pictures go to card and sometimes on phone. very random.  another point to be noted is that since it is curved screen so you have to be very careful in selecting the cover/case else you will crack the screen on first fall.otherwise, the phone is slim and sleek. real stylish.
this phone is great! very easy to use and figure out where to find the settings. it was very easy to activate with my verizon sim card and isn't loaded with all those useless apps that ""locked"" phones come with.
samsung has removed the built in android transfer option. setting up this phone and transferring your data and settings is infuriating. considering returning the phone as this is arduous. the promises from samsung that their smart switch application will work with any android 4.1 or later phone is plainly false as the application is incompatable with my android 7.0 phone.bixby is an annoyance that should be completely removed; google assistant already does a better job.overall, this phone is nothing but an infuriating attempt for samsung to enforce brand loyalty by making ti painful to move to or from a galaxy device.
the phone is good and all but i think its refurbished.  there was no samsung deal on the box just regular scotch tape .
i took a long time choosing a phone; they cost so much now & i plan to keep this one for a long time. i also want to change service providers with my own phone. i really liked this galaxy s9, but every time i read a negative review about s9s or s8s i had to chase down information proving or disproving it. i didn't know if i could afford an s9.  when i was ready, i chose this s9 in orchid - i'd been watching it daily. the camera is as great as reviews everywhere say it is, and there are so many upgrades since my old s5 came out! i registered my new phone on samsung.com  and it doesn't affect anything that i purchased my unlocked phone from samsung, not from a service provider. there are many misconceptions among the reviews and comments. it does use wifi - for the web & for making phone calls. i saved money buying on amazon. i couldn't have bought an s9 anywhere else. the seller was really great about responding to any questions i had; i'm glad i purchased my phone from them. this has been a really great purchase experience!
long story short.wanted an unlocked phone just so i can switch carriers whenever i felt like it.i have sprint.put in my sim card and was told that this phone would not work on sprint network....called up sprint and also went to a sprint store,was told phone is locked and they could not activate it....my kid need's a new phone so i sent it to him( he has at&t).he was told that they could not port his number over to that phone(but they were able to give it a new number if he wanted to add a line)......so basically what he did was trade it in to at&t plus $200.00 and got a note 9 instead.........i think both companies did not want to activate a phone that was not purchased from them.
i read a few horrible reviews about not getting a new phone, and for the amount of money involved i was nervous but very happy when i opened the box to find a shiny new phone with all the parts it is supposed to come with.  it was an easy install switching contacts and apps from old phone was a  breeze and even easier installing sim card from old phone to new worked like a charm.  i am very happy with this purchase!  i can't wait to start using it and learning all the cool features!!
i can't believe how good the quality of this phone is. i checked the screen and the body it's almost like new and works perfectly; just as described in the listing. i tested all functions and so far so good; is a replacement my mom's note 5.as for the accessories, it came with the original fast charger, the usb to c connector.the akg earbuds are...sigh, no good; missing the soft bud cushions so can't wear them at all. didn't come with the sim slot opener.the box was sealed with tab and a label sticker showing it's amazon warehouse certified.i will update this post if something is up with the phone.
i may not have owned this phone for very long (i accidentally bought the snapdragon version when what i really needed was the exynos version) but the time i did own this phone was all i need to know how amazing it was. the size of the screen is just stunning, it just absolutely dwarfed my samsung galaxy s5. it's so light and easy to hold onto, that at no time did i ever worry about dropping it. plus, there are plenty of phone cases you can buy right here on amazon if you're worried. it's got plenty of memory, with the option to add a microsd card of up to 400gb to the phone to boost what it already has. the camera is just incredible, i was able to take pictures of my cat as well as wild squirrels and a few deer with quality like never before. also, the customer service that super savings provides just goes above and beyond and then some. when they found out i had made a mistake with my purchase my offered me a full refund in a timely manner. they didn't get angry with me or try to embarrass me or anything of the sort, they were extremely cordial and helpful. i look forward to doing business with them in the future.
i got the box without the phone
i bought this phone and i am traveling internationally. the phone says unlocked, but when i tried to use the phone with a india sim card, it didnt work. when i called samsung customer service, they say that this version is us only. there is something called region lock and i am still struggling to figure out how to make it work in india. i am really frustrated spending so much a phone and doesnt work.
before i ordered this, i read a lot of the reviews. and after reading some horror stories (about people not receiving new phones or the box being empty) i was actually really worried something like that would happen to me too. i contacted the seller but never heard back from them (mizmaz), which did not help with my anxiety while i waited for the package.when i opened the box, the front screen protector film showed some fingerprints and there was no protector for the back of the phone. otherwise the phone looked clean, and all of the extra things like charger were in the box. it has been working fine with t-mobile, so that's great news, all we did was insert the sim and that was it. overall, if you are looking for a new phone but don't want to pay $1000+ for galaxy s10, i think this is a great option. will update the review if we encounter any problems in the future.
while trolling apple for their phones, samsung should keep in mind that their so called flagship s9+ starts malfunctioning barely after hitting a 30-day mark. i didn't waste $800+ money to buy a faulty product like this. would never ever recommend to anyone
just received the product 4 days before its delivery date. due to the influx of good/bad reviews i decided to take a shot at it. the phone box came sealed and all the contents were in the box. it only took a few seconds for my tmobile sim to be recognized and it worked with no problem. i will definitely buy from them in the future.
very easy to get started- i took it to the tmobile store,  and the girl popped my sim card out of my old phone and put it into my new phone in one minute.  the battery lasts forever,  which is awesome!
thanks for exchange of device. better as of now.
i like this phone very much ease  to operate  i don't know what happen  i carry to my local network t.mobil 2-3 time and was not able to unlock it, i was inform by amazon  rept. to contact samsung for help , they sent me shipping labor to return for repair (ticket number, (4148711893) week later ,samsung return the phone  back to me , said it been  determined that the device has passed all quality control  functions successfully.  as you can see i haven had no service out the phone.
only one word to describe it""marvelous "" no buyers remorse.join the club! loving it.
while i was setting this phone up, i saw another email had already been entered. i am returning this phone and buying a s9+, hopefully i'll have better luck with it!
this is a great phone. i am somewhat suspicious on wether it is new or not. i received the phone in new packing. all cables and accessories were included. however, when i tried to setup the phone, i found that it had google's frp. someone had already registered the phone. after about 30 mins of youtube videos i was able to find how to correctly remove the prior account from the phone and set it up. so this is a -1 for the seller rather than the product
love this phone, the picture is great and the camera rivals my iphone, maybe even better. all i needed to do was call t-mobile and get a sim, after that setup was a snap. great signal and super fast
the digitizer on my s7 broke, so i got this phone.  it took a little adjusting, but is largely the same as the s7 in terms of features people actually use on a daily basis.  so if you've enjoyed previous s series models, you'll like this.
so far, so good. this replaces my lg g5 and it's taking a little getting used to.  it has more onboard memory and so far the battery life has been exceptionally good.
love the phonbne but hate, i mean hate, the terrible typing! adds letters, etc i never hit! have to type real slow.. otbyerwuse thi87s happens
i love the size of the screen and the phone overall.  great purchase for a good price.  i have paid a lot more for my other phones.  this phone was unlocked!
itz goooooood
very pleased with the price.  samsung has been sending me a number of ads to buy this, for the wonderful price of $200 more than i paid on amazon
i received the phone with chargers, earphones, usb connector in a samsung case. it worked fine for the first few days, but later  slowed down a little bit.  it happended for a week. now, it works fine. i havenot encountered any further issue. it a good phone, and i am enjoying it.
despite what people say here, this """"unlocked"""" phone does not work on verizon. i bought one of these on amazon, took it to the verizon store and they said it was incompatible. the information on this page is very misleading. i will be returning it for a full refund.as for the phone itself, it is fine. it's a modern phone. but if i can't use it to make calls/texts it is worthless as a phone.
upgraded from my s7 edge to this its a little bit smaller than my previous and the battery doesnt last as long. i kinda prefer the convenience of actually having a home button but i'll just have to get use to it.
i bought this phone for straight talk. put in the sim card and it was good to go. my first samsung and it blows every other phone i've ever had out of the water. wish i would have switched over a long time ago
what can i say?  it's a brand new galaxy s9 with all the bells and whistles.  came in perfect condition and has been excellent since i received it for christmas.  would buy again in a heart beat!
excellent...arrived on time and brand new. everything functions as it should
customizable, not as many limitations as iphone, data transfer smooth overall great camera quality and battery life is just amazing would buy a million times.
everything as expected. but somehow i see delay i uploading pictures whenever i'm using whatsapp which i'm not sure problem of software or hardware (band compatibility). it was difficult to go from note 8 size to s9 small screen but in a week i was settled. also lightweight body is a greay advantage especially when using it at bedtime.
phone seems to work perfectly fine although amazon didnt put any bubble wrap in the box so there was nothing keeping it from getting slammed around im lucky it wasnt damaged love the fast unlock with finger print sensor samsungs website doesnt recognize the imei to register though nor did metro pcs's website for activating it had to call customer service to get it to go through
bought this phone.  love it so far.  however after getting verizon service and loading and transferring data from my old phone to the galaxy s9+ the phone started getting really hot pretty fast.  i'm giving it a few day to play with the setting to see if i have to many apps running in the back ground. stay tuned.
speaker often goes in and out from being normal then to an awful echo.
i am an android user.....i would say samsung user i loveed itt!! bought on after 2 days of its release on market!! thanks alot!!
still learning about it and getting it set up fully. only problem i had was with straight talk. took 4 days for me to finally get it online. taking a new out of the box unlocked phone to straight talk can be confusing if you try to do it with computer or ai. call during their open hours and get a real person.
no problems, transferred my two chips to new phone from my s7 and works fine....expensive but worth it.
received ""midnight black s9 used-like new"" today and opened phone with all items in the box. phone seems to be ok for now but will have to see after a fee days if it works with no defects.i was surprized to see the earphones came damaged. looked as if one earpiece was chewed on by a pet. i am requesting a refund or a replacement for them
phone equipment was as expected. however, for the lower cost than from a wireless provider there was a lot of added headaches on my my end to get it activated. i am a verizon customer. the phone initially came as a sprint device. verizon store was not able to help me activate this initially. it turns out the os was from nov 2018 and had to be upgraded before i could activate. once i did this, i was on the phone with verizon support for over an hour, with countless ""try this and reboot"" attempts.  it finally did work, but i put about 3 hours of my time into the activation.
bought this to replace older phone (sprint network).  phone works wonderfully and no issues getting it on the sprint network (just went to sprint store for sim card).
it was a warehouse deal but a pair of very well used head phones that weren't even samsung head phones that come with the phone... the headohone had ear wax chunks inside ewww gross. it was also missing the charger.the phone itself... it's nice.
i had samsung galaxy s6 and i wanted to upgrade my phone with the newer version. i loved everything about s9 so far. i liked the picture quality. i bought s6 about 3years ago and it is still new except its battery drains comparatively faster and is in good shape.
its perfect runs and looks great love it
used-gadget has the best prices for used phones. i got one that was used-acceptable condition but i would say it's excellent quality! the description was accurate
simple a great phone....surpassed all my needs
i like my galaxy s 9+ very much, is very fast, takes awesome pics, sound it's great. my disappointment is that it doesn't have video chat, can't set up individual messages alert tones, can't set up wallpaper on messages, background is plain white, very boring. besides that it is a good quality phone.
the service seems to be spotty with the s9. my s7 never had any issues with service area. there are certain areas in my home that have a bad connection or drop calls. frustrating
was initially tempted by the moto g6 or x4 but the s9, in addition to more sensors used in various application, has better processor, very good camera, microphone which are useful when used with smule!
no bad review or nothing out of the ordinary. the phone was exactly as i purchased it through amazon, new and with all the accesories mentioned. it has good quality of sound and image.
this is the best smartphone i have used yet. it comes with many useful apps and is easy to control. with a smartphone at this price, i recommend getting an extended warranty.
after reading some of the bad reviews, like others, i was a little nervous. phone arrived overnight, appears to be brand new with all accessories (protective film on front and back of phone, accessories all wrapped, everything in box, but no actual seal on the box). had to take into the t-mobile store since my sim card was the older style large one from a galaxy s5. they gave me a new sim (no charge), and after a firmware update and smart switch from my old phone in the store, all is good.
love the big screen,great speedgreat picturesthe vision angle on the camera is narrower than the s8the software on the camera sometimes makes errors.great phone
very fast and durable phone. battery lasts for a day with regular use. camera is great, already took 1000s of photos within couple of months.
bought this phone 8 mos ago....it freezes...stalls..  sceeen voice recognition comes on by itself. not happy
awesome! i love this phone. so far no issues and it was decent enough deal when bundled.
we just switched to prepaid and decided that since i was buying my phone outright i wanted to get away from apple after like 10 years. the phone was in great condition and unlocked like it said. all in all, it was worth every penny
works perfectly on verizon with a stop to get a new sim card for it. (my old one was a mini.  it takes a nano)  i just hope it lasts as long as my last samsung phone.
i have used android all my life. this is a very useful phone and love everything about it. i have trouble typing sometimes with my meaty fingers but that can easily be fixed by changing the keyboard style. other than that it really is worth it. 3500 mah will definitely last you all day. sometimes i could be on my phone for 5 hours straight and it still be 45% or higher battery.
i am really happy with the galaxy s9 phone that i have,  however, i am trading in the new unopened phone i just purchased, towards the purchase of the new samsung galaxy s10 phone that i'm pre- ordering today!!! i can't wait to get my hands on the new s10+ phone that i have been seeing on the reviews that i have watched on youtube!!
pictures are awesome, even when it is almost dark, they turn out perfectly.  have been enjoying my phone very much with no complaints
was disappointed that it wasn't the us version of the phone but the korean version it came without plastic wrapped over it and no seal but besides that everything else inside came as it should so far the phone works great
i bought this phone in august 2018 only th realized from an individual with s s9 that mine is not the real deal. please stop selling things so expensive and they are fake. now the return period have gone and dont know what to do.
i was expecting like a ""regular"" seal tape they would normally use you know.. the circle tape, but instead they had taped it straight top to bottom. i wanted a ""clean"" box so i tried to gently pull it off slowly. of course i didn't come off nicely and torn the s9+ box cover. i'm not too happy with that, but hey... i still got the phone :/
i use this phone to run my own business and it has been reliable and responds quickly. being a female, the color matters to me and i got exactly what i wanted plus some! i highly recommend this seller and this phone!
i had the s5, then the s6, then the s7, went back to the s5. wasnt impressed with the s6 or s7. the s9 is a totally different matter. very nice and improved platform. havent found a thing i am not happy with . well worth the price.
exactly as described! works perfectly with cricket wireless!
great phone, great features, scored points with my wife - she is a hardcore iphone user but the s9 changed it all.
i purchased this phone and only had it two weeks before it started freezing up and not recognizing touch on the screen. also, this phone does not hold charge very long. i have to charge my phone at least twice a day. very dissappointed with this phone. it was supposed to be brand new, but it does not work as it should.
i like that the phone is unlocked and is able to be used with verizon service.the battery could last longer and the camera isn't the greatest.i give 5 stars for the price and speed of arrival.
i liked everything about this phone. wished that samsung would get it together when it comes to their tablets. phones i recommend, tablets no.
love love love this! the speed is amazing, i only have to charge once a day and use constantly, the picture is better than expected. i seriously love everything about it. i upgraded from an s5 and samsung didn't disappoint.
perfect. arrived, put in my sim  and waited for everything to load. i run off cricket wireless. no issues, great deal. less than in store
took the phone to boost and when they scanned it, it said the phone could not be activated.  had to return and bought a phone locally so i could have it before christmas.  i am sure it would have been great if it activated.
my wife bought me this samsung s9plus for my birthday. i am used to a apple products ( ipads,iphones & etc ) i love this phone because it does everything i use it for. calls,watch movies,reading and alarms.. i like the wireless charging which makes it so easy to use and know where it is at night time. bixby ( like alex) is another feature that i like besides the big screen. i like this phone
i recommend this phone to anyone who uses a smart phone. it's easy to set up, much support from samsung.
this is my first smart phone. the learning curve was more than i expected. i am still woeking on all the many features.
i just got my  samsung galaxy s9 yesterday so far i  really like iti'll update on a later date
love everything except  bixby.  i have just muted that feature with no problem. perfect size
picture quality and voice clarity is great.  i like wifi calling feature this phone comes with which is great for people with poor network connections in the general surroundings.  however the battery seems to drain too quick even with no phone activity which i was surprised and not too happy.  otherwise its a good purchase
all of a sudden my phone has issues staying connected online whether it is using wi-fi or not. also - the screen freezes and the touch screen will not work. apps will not load... should i go on? i just got the phone in december. it is only 4 months old. funny how the support expired 3 weeks ago, too. do not buy this!
this was not to difficult to set up on verizon, just have to dial *86 to get voicemail. put in the sim card from my old phone, signed into my google account and the phone was mostly ready to go. love the phone, super slick. a little extra work for unlocked but not that big of a deal.
absolutely love this phone and the price was astounding. couldn't have asked for a better deal at the time of my purchase.
returning phone...no wifi calling. can’t use  where there isn’t a network.
i am loving this phone so far. i am still navigating thru all its features and getting an understanding of what the phone really can do. i haven't ventured into its technical features a.sfar as powerpoint or anything. i have to read the manual to discover all the aspects of the phone but so far i'm loving it!
well i just received it today and everything was in the original box with all documentation. all accessories we're new in the box and well so far so good!!! it's a verizon phone i just called my provider metro pcs and they switched it over and it only took about 5 mins and it was up and running! the phone is beautiful and man i can't wait to figure it all out the resolution is insanely clear.
only just received in the last day or so. phone was new, in box, with all items described. bluetooth file transfer works. battery lasted a full 24 hours after getting a full charge. first phone call to husband to test phone had horrible static. hung up and tried again and had no issue. had several calls since with no issue. speaker is good. haven't used the camera much except to take some review photos. quality is good.
i'm sure that the cell phone battery is defective, because normally a new cell phone usually lasts the battery at least the full day and in my case with normal use the battery does not last the whole day, i must charge it again in the middle of the day so that last until night
i brought this phone 1 month ago im satisfied with this s9+ but the main thing is i paid 700+ dolars i i got sprint network phone its unlocked but this sprint i cannot remove and when im using hot spot i t can connect only 1 user per time and that sprint aplications i have i cant remove them i think its not fair to give a sprint or any other provider phones unlocked sonpeople to struggle with this kind of things
great phone. unlocked so just moved sim to new phone and had service. works well, lots of features.
great phone. lives up to its qualities . take amazing photos.  actually is water proof o recommend getting butt plugs for it if you plan on taking photo in deep water. everything about it was new . battery life is a little weary i guess it depends on how much you use your phone i've had days where i dont use it and it stays at 90% and someday i dont use it and it's dying could be background app use but its provides weekly updates on battery use .. all in all great phone would recommend 100 %.. shipped as expected
so far love the phone.  facial recognition lock is great and the fingerprint reader location is excellent and works better than my s7 did.battery life is great, but it's a new phone so hard to judge that accurately at this time.
this was an international phone and would not work with sprint. i was able to receive a full refund.
i love it like omg i’ve reading the reviews and the photos they take i was scary that it was going to be but hey what a surprise i gotta the samsung galaxy 9+ but sadly the s10 out lol idc i love the phone
i did not undetstand unlocked meant that so.e features with own carrier might not work. sending back to buy locked version from retailer.
its everything i expected and more.  i went from an s7 edge to the 9+ and i'm in love.  the camera, the screen, its fast and responsive.  took time getting used to but i'm still digging it.
it's a nice phone. just go to an actual store. maybe you won't get 3 defects in a row.
she absolutely 100% love this phone. i got it for my lady for christmas, all she can do is show everyone and talk about how amazing the camera is. awesome job samsung!!
i live in canada and i purchased this phone. it's an unlocked phone like it states. so it works for all providers. you dont need to worry about that. dont let the model number fool you. the model number is the north american version. the ""1"" you see at the end, only means it's an unlocked phone. everything was in the box. excellent condition. and it actually arrived 1 day before expected. its absolutely fantastic for its price. i saved like $300!
i will start this review by stating that i live in a very weak signal area no matter what device is used. this being said, i compared the s9+ to a note 9 and a 50.00 lg. very weak antenna compared to other phones! tried 2 different 9+ both had same weak reception. i compared to note 9 and a cheap lg - even the cheap lg had a stronger signal.
does everything that it's supposed to... i pulled the nano-sim card out of my old s6 active... then tranfered everything ... i have at&t...and it works without any problem... came with every thing... ear phones...wall charger ...sim card tool... and the cable to transfer all my pictures and text ...  perfect !!!
the s9+ has a crack on the back and small hairline cracks on the front screen, the accessories came scratched on purpose.
so far so good! i'm excited about the price! it's a slim phone for sure and also narrow. i upgraded from a s7
great phone for the price.  this is my first samsung phone, so far i am very happy with the performance.there is one issue.the charger connection is not working properly. i have to plug in on a special side of the type c head.
i just received my s9 late afternoon on 4/7/19 . i charged it overnight. today, april 8th 2019 i brought it to sprint store to activate the device. however, the representative tried twice to activate and said it was not compatible with sprint services. now, i have no emergency phone and we have no landline. not happy after being told it was unlocked for sprint carriers.
battery dies fast and constant opens bixby and wallet. keyboard adds space in middle of words. finger print is awesome
us cellular says you can't use all of the features because this phone wasn't made for us cellular. plus we get poor service now, like dropped calls and slow internet.
1. shipped to alaska. good job. wouldn't ship to my location in alaska which i found odd but it's cool we made it work.2. got a sim card pack from at&t, and hooked rite up. no hassle no worries. i love this phone. thanks so much
the screen cracked from a lite touch on the edge making it very ugly to look at.
definitely won't need to upgrade for a while, best phone i've had to date.
exactly as described! just inserted my sim card and everything worked! awesome buy!
this phone is so sick. so fast and screen is amazing. great for the price. i got it thro 5 months payments. thanks amazon.
the phone  is stylish and works great with my straight talk sim card. i'm not real pleased with the camera quality though. i think my galaxy s7 takes better pictures
love the phone, saved me $300 from the verizon store. with all the accessories i wanted it still came put $100 less than verizon. activation was easy and came with a sim card removal tool, took me all of 7 minutes to activate on verizon without any help from them. only drawback was the long shipping time but it was economy shipping and free. otherwise no complaints!
phone is perfect in every aspect. the battery lasts longer than my old iphone 6. this is my first upgrade to android so i find no issues with the battery. so far i'm loving the phone.
so far everything has been great with the new device, it came in perfect condition and verizon sim worked immediately. battery life is very good.
warning: if you want a protection plan that covers loss or theft, don't buy your phone on amazon! i just bought this galaxy s9 and i can't find any company that will sell me a protection plan which covers loss or theft.asurion seems to only sell warranties through phone carriers, squaretrade doesn't cover theft, and it looks like verizon won't sell me the coverage because i didn't buy the phone from them, also i'm not on contract. i'll update this if i have any luck, i'll probably just end up returning this and buying a phone from verizon, even though i am mad at them :(...
works with straight talk verizon sim card. haff to call a few times to get someone to set the data up properly, but other than that. i love this phone so much.
ordered this phone during black friday. i've read review about this smartphone and was wondering if it won't work or i will get it used. however, i got this phone brand new (as i think) and inside the box almost everything was ok. there was no seal and it was kind of dust or smth i don't know. ordered it new from samsung and it still works. if anything happens, i will update this review
at first, i was apprehensive because of the deal price, then some of the international reviews, this is the u.s. version... brand new, i popped the sim card out of my verizon s8 into this and that's it, i'm online, activated messaging calls data and everything 30 seconds later!
got the wrong item
cell service seems to be less than my old model....6s active.  at my house i usually 9nly get one bar for a signal and sometimes no bars while others in the house (same cell provider) have 2- 3 bars all the time.
all the features, all the upgrades.  it's a beautiful infinity screen.  best purchase ever!!
awesome
only had for a short time but everything seems to work correctly
do you know if you will have the 256 gig available? i've already ordered 2 phones and need a 3rd but i want the higher capacity model. phones are awesome btw.
it was a good deal. i honestly expected a bit more of the battery but since the phone has so many features (that can be turned off) it consumes a lot of energy. but the product in general fullfil my expectations and i'm happy with my purchase.
previously had the moto e4 +5000 unit batterylasted foreverwish this phone did otherwise fast function
this international model won't let you turn off the camera shutter noise and is incompatible with twrp and all other android root methods.
just like new. love my phone no scratches dents or anything. setup was easy.
phone is no longer working......not powering up.....smh
it's quite big for average hand so it's hard to use with one hand. face recognition still needs some work as it requires the face to be at similar distance that you had programmed with. don't think it ever work with sunglasses. other than that,  no complain as of yet.
i finally upgraded from my note 4. man, what a difference!like going from a ford to a ferrari.
i started to switch to an iphone after having issues with the s7.. decided to get the s9+ and am impressed. this phone is awesome!!
came in genuine packaging with all parts and manuals. phone was brand new, worked flawlessly
love galaxy phones and this is a big step up from my s7.  love the color! did have an issue with the 1st phone i received, it stopped charging and the screen became unresponsive within 2 weeks of receiving.  amazon did however replace it after a few calls.
a replacement for a dead samsung s5, this was a great choice - very satisfied all around.
i purchased this mobile on thanksgiving and i would say this was one of a fantastic model in the recent years.picture quality was amazing and have a very good battery life, though i'm a minimal user (i do not use heavy apps).thank you amazon for a wonderful deal and thank you samsung for a quality phone..!
we are having problems getting data on our phone went to provider it’s set up correctly
great phone. looks and feels great in your hand. still like my iphone better
this is the best phone i've ever owned. transferring all my contacts, photos, videos and apps was a breeze. the only reason that i didn't give it 5 stars is because after paying nearly a thousand dollars for this phone, i still had to go to the verizon store, plunk down another hundred bucks to get the sim card and to use that to activate the phone.
awesome phone, the battery life is excellent and the picture quality
i absolutely love the photo quality. it also came really fast. i love amazon and i’ve never bought a phone off of it for but this just proves it. amazon is the best! the sound is great too!
do not buy phones, etc from amazon
the phone i got was not as advertised. tried to activate it and when it didn't work, contacted verizon, for them to tell me that the phone wasn't being recognized by their system, and wasn't unlocked.
i love this phone completely, and at first look.
love my phone; battery last the all day.the camera makes nice quality photos; large display. overall great phone.
my 3 year old samsung s6 edge got pink line issue, so thought of replacing the phone. i got this samsung s9 from amazon. great price for cyber monday. the battery life is great. picture quality is wonderful. the security features are good.
great phonemy only regret is i should have ordered the s9 plus for the larger screen, but i love the phone!
battery life sucks! it will be drained half way in your day no matter how you use it. i called both amazon support and samsung support, both recomended to adjust the brightness of my screen :|
it has a glitch with speakerphone.  if you are using speaker it is a 50/50 chance the person on the other line won't hear you. i think this is a glitch that samsung already knows about. otherwise,  i love the phone but i like the older models.
loved this phone. perfect packaging and easy to set up. i opened the box put in my sim card and was done.
exactly what it says
this is simply the best cell phone i have ever bought.
best phone i've ever owned. beautiful design, screen, camera, etc....
as advertised. love the device, love the screen. i am very happy with my purchase.
i'd like to start out by saying i've never had any of the previous galaxies, so i don't know how the s9+ companies to previous models. that saying, i absolutely love this phone. i recently switched to the galaxy s9+ from the zte axon 7 because of the limitations on that phone. the axon 7 is a really good phone, and although it is an android, there are a lot of differences between that phone and samsung androids.the galaxy s9+ has a great battery life, i charge it using the wireless fast charger in the morning before work and it will last all day through a 10 hour shift plus the gym. i like all the security features like the fingerprint scanner and face detection. it also has great memory and runs easily. i can do multiple things at a time and have multiple windows open and it's not a problem. the sound is also really good, i don't have to turn it up as loud to get the same quality music as with my old phone and the display for the screen is awesome. i take pictures and they look like they are in hd. by far one of my favorite features is the edge panel where you can put frequently used apps and contacts and such. i use that all the time.so far i have no complaints. i've been using this phone for about a month and i'm in love with it. also buying it through amazon using their store card and 24 month financing was a plus. that's the only way i could afford such a high price phone.i would definitely recommend this phone to someone else. i never rate anything 5 stars, but as of now the galaxy s9+ is worth it.
love my phone
this phone really needs a user's manual or you'll miss out on a lot of the wonderful things this phone can do. i went from a s5 to a s9. ask bixby, she'll help you.
the bluetooth chip came broken in my phone. very annoying and taking a long time to repair. better to buy something more sure than something that could possibly arrive broken.
love the phone no issue as of yet with phoneonly issue i had was with the shipping,it was loose in the box,no protective stuffingplus when u open the phone it doesnt have the same screen protectors u r used 2.that might make u think its a refur...its not
there was no phone in the box!!!
delivered faster than expected. phone is in great condition. i can't see anything wrong with it. still learning all the features  no scratches. very pleased.
love it, upgraded from iphone 7plus
the appliance came with the back cover broken. unfortunately i live in brazil and i can not send the device back. i am extremely dissatisfied with samsung lack of quality.
this product was being sold as new. the phone was clearly used as evidenced by a samsung cloud account set up and a user icon. definitely being returned.
love everything about! samsung diehard!
this phone has a mind of its own. very unhappy with it
unlocked us version.  i simply swapped the sim card from my iphone to this one and ran smart switch.  was up and running in under 30 minutes. beautiful screen and decent battery life.  works on the verizon cdma network and the data speed is noticeably faster than my previous iphone 7+ on the same network.  earphones that came with it sound great as well, which is a plus.  i have gone back and forth between android and iphone over the years.  my last android was a galaxy s5+ which was an energy hog.  given the power of this phone i find the battery life impressive.
wife not complaining,  i like it.
purchased it, didn't care for it so i sent it back. sound quality was great though.
this was given as a gift. she loves it
i do love this phone!! i didn't think i would be able to afford a new galaxy since i'm non-contact, so when i saw this on a payments option??? i jumped on this deal!!! very happy. thanks amazon! 😊
charges quickly.  everything transferred easily.  i love my new phone.
the phone randomly disconnects from calls and internet.  it is unreliable and for a phone that i bought in october, the product support window closed on january 10th.  i guess they figured that since the phone will die in three months they should not offer support a minute beyond that.  don't buy this unless you have disposable income.
used it for less than 2 months and it has started being kicked off the vzw mobile network. it no longer can be registered on the network, so it's totally useless. amazon is charging a restocking fee. stay away, don't by if you wish to use verizon wireless service.
my phone has started dropping calls after only 5 months.  i often can't send or receive texts and the call quality has gotten very bad.  i am extremely disappointed that there isn't anything amazon can do for this faulty phone.
great phone. love it so far.
great phone, used it to write this review.
el mejor celular con sistema android
very satisfied with my phone, but did think it was a bit pricey.
i haven't had much time with the phone as of yet.  i am disappointed that the description says it comes with a usb cable but mine didn't.
will never go back to iphone. way too much$$$$$.
bought as a gift, haven't heard any complaints
i love this phone, i have like 2 months with it, and i keep discovering new things about it.
upgraded from another samsung and i love how easy this was to set up! lots of cool features with the s9+
so far so good. never thought i'd leave apple but samsung has a better product.
very nice product easy to use, works well love the designe the color blue love it
very nice phone. great price.
great phone and great price.
it s not originalgive my money back!
is your phone 4g in the us? i bought this phone and my internet is terrible. my 4g is not working at all. and the phone is not even showing that is a 4g. its terrible.
love my new phone
love this phone so much! it is the best i've ever had.
everything works except for the iris's!
i returned this phone because it was not unlocked. unlocking the phone would have cost me $39.
when i received phone the both part of the screen did not work like it should. i used it 2 more weeks to see if i could get past that and one night the screen turned black with a light line at the top. i went through the process of returning the phone almost a month ago and have not received my refund.
an overall good phone. highly satisfied with it. would recommend.
this is crazy only a charger and an empty box wtf!! package was open i am very disappointed!!! never thought i would have this issue
i broke my s9+ in less than 6 months so needed something urgent. amazon is great,it did ship me in less than 24 hours and i'm happy with my phone
too skinny
love it
works as it should. sim card fit perfect. factory phone, unlocked.
best phone i've ever had. i would recommend to anybody !
reasonably sized, capable smartphone with decent battery life.
couldn't ask for a better operating and functioning phone. feature rich!
i have upgraded from s8 plus and i really see an improvement in the performance , especially camera, ar emoji and face detection features are awesome.
i just started using it, but so far it is great!!!
it feels like the android slips from top to bottom like happened with my moto.. i did not call to verify  my s9 to make sure was not a knock off. i was assured my amazon sales person it wasn't. think i will go
well worth the money spent!!
upgraded from my s7 and absolutely love this phone.
i was expecting a longer battery life although i'm pleasantly pleased to be able to enjoy my phone all day doing everything i want with my phone off of one charge. that includes movie watching, social media, emails, pandora, web surfing, and amazing picture taking.
love my galaxy, switched to galaxy after the iphone 6 and havent looked back for a second
it's a excellent phone. i was very afraid about some coments by the screen, but has been dropped several times and has not suffered any damage. i love the color, it's beautiful, it is very simple to manage, with a lot of options to play about the camera, the security, the apps. i'm very happy with my purchase
love this phone.
great phone. the camera is the best.
i am a samsung galaxy fan, haven't been disappointed yet.
i was nervous to order after reading some reviews stating the phone wasn't included or they received a dummy phone. but it arrived quickly and was exactly as described. came with all the accessories and works with at&t
bad description! not all unlocked s9 work on all carriers. only verizon unlocked version has cdma.
great phone with wonderful features,  but the battery doesn't last longer.
i loved it, but sometimes it freeze, it wasn't to happen with a new mobile. i had iphone 8 before and it doesn't freeze. but i like android. that's why i bought it.
i'm very happy with this phone!!!
received a international model(sm-g965f/ds) with no warranty.
excelente
best phone on the market at the moment!
good phone and has a great camera
good phone
great product! much higher quality and experience than my last samsung smart phone. in my opinion the s9+ outclasses the iphone by every measure.
came on time and was everything it said in the description.
so far i love this phone.  it is a bit more narrow than my old phone, same length, so i""m happy with it, overall.  i""m still learning about its features and love bixby!  so far, so good!
phone calls are a lil low at times but other sound are fine. everything else about the phone so far is perfect and i believe will be a fine investment. my s5 lasted me 3 years, so i hope it will last me as long if not longer.
as expected.
this phone is amazing.  there is nothing more to say. the picture quality is amazing, the software is amazing. i thought transitioning to iphone to andriod would be hard but it really isn't.
pretty awesome phone that you can get a great deal for at the time of this purchase (nov 2018)
the phone itself pretty nicely. perfect sound image, and quality. lovely interface. so far so good.
still trying to get the kinks out but so far it's ok
brand new samsung s9 plus. everything perfect .  i use it with t mobile in usa and works perfectly.
as described
enjoying this phone. it came just in time for my meeting at work.
super good phone
s9 in its best form.
my new samsung galaxy s 9 plus is perfect! i love it!
glitches using coaches eye
love love love this phone
excellent condition. amazing phone!!
absolutely and completely locked, previously owned.
great
got this for my son's graduation. he is thrilled.
the samsung 9+ was an excellent buy it a lot faster than it predecessors, the pictures are clear and clean
superb phone.
absolutely love the samsung galaxy s9.
liked this because it was a better value than purchasing in the phone store.  way less money for a new ph. with a warranty.
i love it! came in perfect condition!
love my new samsung galaxy s9. the best part is samsung health and bixby manager. just say a command with a push of a button or turn phone on and talk!! i dont like the new charging input adapter is confusing me. how do u charge in the car?
no seal on box (only tape). no instruction manual/terms&conditions. returning.
this phone is not unlocked. took it to the verizon store and they said this phone was not enabled for their service.
use to a j7 13 mp camera other than that happy. great upgrade even with the down step in camera. truly unlocked phone has cdma i use boost mobile through sprint network. can not activate online have to buy sim card pack and do over phone or always can go in store.
excellent
you won't find a bigger and better android phone than the samsung galaxy s9 plus, thanks to its oversized 6.2-inch curved screen and low-light-defeating dual-lens camera.
love the new samsung  galaxy s9  phone.  had a s7 edge, this is more efficient,  better in everyway. absolutely would recommend this phone to anyone.
arrived fast. perfect condition at a great price
perfect condition works great
really good. my girlfriends birthday present and she loves it
after i spent an entire day transferring and setting up the phone i realized the next day there is no wifi calling.. samsung s9s have wifi calling and this unlocked phone does not.. nice phone but have to have wifi calling. its also a feature you pay for.
the us version of this phone has a bootloader that cannot be unlocked. this is blatantly anti-consumer and renders the phone useless unless you intend to use the stock firmware unmodified...and why would you? i recommend strongly against this phone.
we are very disappointed with the way shipping was made. being on prime it got delivered 4 days late. we shipped it as a gift and it reached much later than the occasion which did not serve our purpose. very disappointed. personally i won a samsung phone and i love it.
im the kind of user that jumps from iphone to android, convinced that android offers a lot more but the problem lies in components with each manufacturer. i only buy flagship smartphones as im a power user and i decided to give it a go with the impressive s9.im extremely happy.im not getting into details and specs, the internet is already loaded with them, i think the experiences is more valuable to you.the device is top notch,  migrating from another android device or an iphone is extremely easy with the included adapter,  screen is wonderful, no surprise considering samsung builds the iphone x screen. well obviously samsung is the screen guru nowadays.everything is great on this device, works much better than iphone in bluetooth connections, is extremely fast etc.ui is very good, and packed with options. fast charging is impressive, 10 to 100 in 60 mins. and battery lasts all day with normal use.cellular signal strenght is very good, wifi is very good, its wather proof, what else can you ask for?
this phone is freaking amazing
best samsung yet.
maravilloso
really good phone. i liked how it takes pictures, internet connection is fast, and overall speed of the phone while opening apps. more advanced features to use for those who like to experience something new. so far i am glad that i bought this samsung galaxy s9.
excellent product
love it and hope they replace mine without deadspots and issues with warranty and recommended insurance.
the husband loves it and we got it at a deal
this phone is great.  everything on it works wonderful
still working
no phone in box. just factory packaging with accessories and an empty phone spot. make sure and read all the one star reviews!!!
so far so good, i have no complaints about the phone, just got it so i'm still figuring everything out. had a little trouble getting phone activated, however one that was taken care of the phone had been great!
love my samsung .
sensacional
fully unlocked
product absolutely new, it works well with redpocket, and t-mobile. i haven't tried with another carriers.
wonderful phone, excellent camera. works great on the att network.  fast!
perfect
s9 is a great phone.
so far i love everything about my samsung 9+ new phone and i would be hard pressed to go back to the "" great deal "" phones.
yes, t-mobile wifi calling works.
phone was brand new, so far no issues. fits the description
perfect!
the telefon it is like new, but came without removing pin, case and replaced rubber bud for headphones.
thank u
it was really easy walked into us cellular and got a prepaid plan just like that.
i bought this certified used but its operating like it was bought brand new. when it came it had no visible wear-n-tear marks nor glitches. i'm very satisfied with this purchase.
upgraded from an s7. so big step up.
after 2 month of use out of nowhere the cellphone screen is not working. i have dead zones and the screen is flickering. i live in argentina and samsung's argentina does not want to fix it since i bought it in usa. i need a solution right away!!!!
works as expected!
amazing, all the features are perfect. battery is not bad, and everything works smoothly.
i'm quite the heavy user, so the battery life only lasts about 13-15 hours. the phone runs smooth and handle everything i throw at it with ease. great buy  so far. been using it for just under a month, and will update if anything changes :)
nice so far
love it
samsung superior! iphone inferior! 😂
excellent phone. does scratch up fairly easily from drops - please get a case for yours along with the phone.
excellent phone. love the change in audio. fedex did an amazing job in getting me the package on time.
so far so good
phone looks nice has good picture and sound quality, but the battery life is average.
very consistent phone. was easy to set up, just put sim in and ready to go. one draw back though, the battery life needs work, but other than that very solid.
i like it for the quality of the pictures, ease of use and style of the phone. the battery however run down way too quickly.
bought a samsung s9 got it home and the audible was so poor you could not hear the other person speaking, sent it back got another one it is doing the same thing sending it back today.
i upgrade s6 to s9. totally satisfied.
didn't come with user manual, but its online so it works out. everything else works haven't had any issues so far. came with a page that claimed to offer free stuff for giving 5 star review, it has been a month and nothing.
my fionce love samsungi love this phone
i love it! the camera is amazing. the phone works great. i've only had a small problem with the headphone jack. but other than that it's amazing
the phone was an at&t phone. my carrier tried everything but was unable to unlock it. after waiting for >3 weeks to get the phone,i had to return it. wasted > 1 month of my time. most aggravating. just tell the truth!
fast phone,great pictures, expandable memory and is splash proof. very happy with my buy
just great
easy to set up following the instructions given.  i was nervous i that i would not be able to set the phone up myself but instructions that come with the phone make it very easy. had s4 that i upgraded from.
everything was great, though a quite a few months later the battery has weakened a bit and the performance is starting to have a few issues. though that's a natural thing i assume with phones, just like my old s6.
the newest s9 is simply terrific! it works in venezuela.
everything went as expected,  and the s9 arrived perfectly and is everything i wanted. thanks!!
keeps dropping wifi don't know if this is a common issue, the box was not sealed. having trouble making and receiving calls.
cool phone!!!
took phone to cellular provider for set up and was told that someone else still owes payments on the phone so it’s blocked on their system. so basically the phone was a stolen item being resold.
i changed over from a phone that has a certain fruit on it, to samsung galaxy s9. i really enjoy this phone. i will never go back.
great product
un buen telefono a un buen precio se lo recomiendo a cualquiera...a good cellphone good price i recommend it to averybody...
first unlocked phone and everything i could ever ask for!  upgraded from a galaxy 5. saved $100 over at+t while having no bloatware.
great phone. reception could be a little better. battery life's decent. performance is great. love that it's water proof. best phone i've had. price could be a little lower.
great cell phone
i like everything about the phone. it is as advertised and had no problems with it.
works perfectly i made an excellent purchase.
this is the worst top of the line samsung phone i have ever owned and how the heck you get any kind of replacement for this junk. restart on or 2 times a day because applications quit, screen flips out and goes where it wants instead of to the icon you press. try to answer phone calls and you have to back out of all other screens and if you try to close all screens it shuts off the phone call. s9+ just plain sucks
i do not like nothing
muy bueno
so far so good. i miss having an actual galaxy s phone. i've had other phones before even different brands and it just doesn't stack up to this. thanks again.
i received the phone in perfect conditions with all the original items included (charger, headphones, etc). i've been using the phone more than a month and i didn't have any problem. i'm happy with my phone so far.
excellent phones!!👌
i've owned premium handsets since the early days of android and even palm, and this phone is awesome.
no problem setting this up with sprint without all the unneccesary sprint apps and them take it to att or verizon just by getting there sim card. beautiful phone with all accessories new in original box!
amazing phone
i'm not an idiot... but this phone makes me feel like an idiot.  i purchased the phone via amazon for my verizon service 2 months ago.  it started having problems (randomly resetting etc).  i booted in safe mode and even attempted to do a factory reset.  the phone is in an endless boot cycle.  i've found that getting it serviced is a challenge.  verizon couldn't help me, calling samsung directly couldn't help me.... they've told me to contact amazon directly which i'm about to do.it's pretty obvious that the market couldn't sustain quality issues like this, so i think i got a lemon.
got the s9+ to work with sprint. took the phone to a sprint store and the ""c"" sim card out of the 3 in 1 byod sim package worked. no issues so far. phone works great and no issues with service.
old phone , no papers and no protection covers.
great
trabajar
exelent
do not buy. every 1hr it keeps shutting down. fraud fraud.... old
super fast.
great price on new phone.
sin ningún problema, en caja y con todos sus accesorios, lo compré desde el salvador pero llegó aquí a california a la casa de mi hermana, recomendado, ahora paso con él todo el día.
just received my device, i'm happy with my purchase. i will be purchasing from
great phone
so far its been a great phone  although the bixby button does get in the way
you get exactly what you order. there is nothing different from what was shown. all the fixtures come with it including the headset and pin. perfect condition and brand new.
amazing phone!
fast, packed with customization, beautiful pictures. occasionally i trigger the edges when i use it in landscape mode but that's not too big of a deal. i wish it was less of a headache to disable bixby. even though i have an app that controls bixby, i still see bixby being triggered slightly before the new intended shortcut is triggered. if you're going to use a work profile on here, be warned that depending on your place of work you will not be able to use custom keyboards (understandably so). it's just a bit confusing when my s7 allowed the use of custom keyboards and the s9+ will not (both phones were used for the same job, don't know why the standards are different). great phone, i'm glad i bought it and am having a better experience with it than the phones i've owned previously (galaxy note 4, galaxy s7, nexus 7, pixel xl, moto x).update september 5, 3018lowering the rating for this. it's only been a few months but i'm already starting to have battery issues. i went from not managing my battery too much to constantly needing to charge and top off my phone. i've started to have a strange charging issue where my phone won't fast charge even though its reporting that its doing so. the only charger that i've found to somewhat efficiently charge my phone is an unmarked charger i got from work. otherwise it takes forever to charge even to 70%. i have yet to contact a samsung service center but will am afraid i'll need to. i've tried ever trouble shooting method short of master resetting my phone. after experiencing these issues with the s7 a while back i'm thinking i might go away from the galaxy line at this point. will report back if i'm able to fix the issue, such a pain.
excellent deal,  i'm grateful this was  available.
love the phone, arrived quick and works perfectly. i'll be keeping this for a couple of years.
love the phone!no issues at all, i had verizon and switched to family mobile.
great phone my boyfriend loves it
i love everything about this phone. the size is not a problem during single hand use. bixby just makes the phone even more awesome. the galaxy s9+ is a great buy. value for money
i bought this for my mother since her old s5 was on its last legs and she loves it. as an iphone user i can admit it's a very beautiful looking phone, and it runs smoothly and clearly.
i love my new phone. shipping was quick and well!
amazing brand new phone!!! camera takes wonderful pictures. easy to set up with metropcs. this item is what is says it is. thank you very much!
compré 2 y uno no agarra carga el otro muy bueno pero me es muy difícil devolverlo porque estoy en venezuela
if you want the latest and the greatest this the phone that changes it all.iphone user here for many many years and i will never ever go back!
whats to say, so far so good the phone have been working perfectly, its my little companion.
arrived quickly and in perfect condition. truly the best phone i've ever owned. can't beat the quality and reliability of galaxy phones.
purchased as an upgrade for the s7, wife is happy with the performance...
well, i got my phone. it's a crazy thing. i love it already. thank you. 😁😁😁👍
i love this device.  excellent buy.. i would recommend this wonderful device to anyone.
great price, delivered undamaged.  love it!
phone keep freezing up and when i tried returning it amazon want to refund 648  only and i paid way more than that for the phone. now am stuck with a problem phone. never again will i put hase
so far the phone is awesome!  everything is working without any issues
very nice cell phone!
best decision
very good product.
i love this phone. it is a great size since i did not want a big phone. i love the features and response of the keyboard.
i used the s7, and now i'm loving the s9
i received a usb drive instead of my s9 phone.
good phone thanks yo paments
the phone over time got much slower
i love my new phone thank y'all
good
great price for the best phone on the market.
fantastic phone but the screen scratches so easily. must get a screen protector. the white dome worked perfect and hid all the scratches.
guess what it works.
i use this phone daily and the charge lasts me the entire day. great phone except i don't like how many apps come installed with the phone. i've had the s7 and s8 and will continue to use samsung phones.
this phone rocks!
i was little skeptical  by reading some of  the reviews about not getting an actual phone from amazon. but, i got a new phone and it is running perfectly.
todo bien pero lo único problema es cuando verico los datos no aparece us  solo méxico tijuana y otros país asiático
love it!!
my husband got this phone for my birthday. it was supposed to be unlocked, but the phone we received is locked and i am unable to use this phone.
this is definitely a huge upgrade from the s6 i used to have with the extra storage and battery life but it is a bit pricey though.
awesome! came brand new everything in the box. beautiful delivery will order from this vendor again!
great battery life!! overall a great phone to have. it does virtually anything.
good phone, there is not complain neither the product nor the provider.by the way good price and it delivered on time.
phone is in excellent condition.
it's ok
i don't know how a brand new phone came  with a battery charger's cable damaged ? i need the battery chargers cable  to re-charge my phone.
(it still gets 5/5 stars because the phone was functioning perfect, just doesn't work on sprint)okay, so after trying to activate the first one at sprint, they said the phone was either the international version (it doesn't appear to be) or it was locked (also doesn't appear to be). so, amazon was super helpful in exchanging the phone for another, saying the serial numbers must have been confused.  i try to activate the second one, and run into the same exact issue.  sprint does not have the imeis of these phones on their list of eligible devices, regardless of everything (model/unlocked/unbranded) pointing to this phone being eligible.  other carriers experience may vary.
good
good
absolutely love my new phone. easy to make the change with no problems. love it, love it. also love the easy payment plan that was offered.
the phone is working great.  i have no complaints about the phone, up to this point, at all.  got the phone in a reasonable amount of time, the packaging was good, and everything worked out of the box.
great phone. my only regret is the price dropped $100 a few days after i bought it.
after reading some of the reviews i was worried i was not going to get what was described but thankfully i did. works great everything was shipped as if i had ordered it from samsung itself.
best phone
if you don't use the phone constantly,  it will last a good 4 days. if you do use it constantly,  it will still last about 2, before you have to charge it again.
great phone!
lo pedí y me enviaron el s9 normal en lugar del s9+... me toca devolverlo y volver a comprar y me tienen varios días el cobro congelado en la tarjeta.
the product was received in good condition. it was is in satisfactory condition.
just received my s9 and it exceeded my expectations.
very good smartphone
so far, so good. as advertised
i absolutely love my phone. picture quality is amazing, screen is vivid, clear crops views. no regrets!!!
excelente celular nuevo y original con todos sus accesorios y caja cerrada sin ningun problema
ok
the camera is great, have no dislike on the cell. since i have no home phone i use it and put family and friends cell numbers, and for work.
samsung is leading the pack in cellphones, new features and beautiful camera a+
seems like a great phone so far. 4 stars was for the price.
it is expensive but it works very well. very good memory capacity, screen resolution, camera resolution, connectivity and fast processor.
hola buenos días, les escribo por que el mi opciones de pedidos me aparece como entregado mi paquete y no lo dejaron y quisiera unas respuestas de ustedes
had the phone for a couple of months now....great phone....no problems...great battery life... camera takes good pics...like this one much better than the iphone!
great phone
still getting used to the phone but the dual camera is a major upgrade from my old s7. battery life is superb. high quality display.
caution: if your carrier verizon this phone is useless. i'm sure there're be many disappointed after christmas when they try to activate.
great deal on a great product.  got it on warehouse deal, like new and it was.
good quality. hasn't failed me yet. totally worth it. it came with all genuine accessories. amazing stuff
no visual voice mail no video calling those bottons are not available on this phone when sent.  not up front, many features not available as with att.
bastante confirme y bien!!!
best price
everything works perfect on this phone,  i lov it....be careful the screen its so ease to break
i got it for myself
best phone yet
great. i liked my s5, but this is a real improvement.
awesome phone. package well. fast. clear screen. love it.
very good stuff. better than x, particulary the split window and the hability to manage/move files from/to internal/external storage
the only thing i deslike is the fact that it's not dual chip, which is something that isn't clearly detailed.  as i had a dual chip s8, i thought it was a brand pattern.
phone is great, fast and responsive, movies look amazing. picture quality when you zoom in looks cartoonish it's really bad
purchased two months ago and signed up for verizon service and everything works great. happy with product.
this phone is amazing, i absolutely love it.
great phone
a few too many over complicated menus but they do give you a lot of options need to be streamlined a little more
buenissimo
100% recomended
awesome. came as advertised. new with accessories and recieved in a timely manner.
everything i hoped it would be!!
excelente calidad del producto, muy conforme
definitely the best smartphone i've used in a while
i like pretty much everything about androids and everything worked fine when i had gotten it!
phone didn't had a imei number that was set up correctly. appeared to be a ""european""-settings phone. so ""unlocked"" is very misleading.
your item is good i paid the total price and bought. after two weeks i don't know why you guys charged me from my saved credit card.
absolutely love this phone!
absolutely amazing. fast shilling, had it in 2 days. completely unlocked like its says in the description. totally worth the buy.
i like everything about this phone.it was delivered quickly. thanks
worth the price. worked perfectly on my carrier with a new sim card. easy set up and all my stuff transferred just fine.
battery fast run out.
so far i have not seen a notable diffrence between the s8 and the s9.i have not tried the camera in dark places yet,  but honestly,  since a went from the s8 to the s9, i feel like im still using the s8.the s9 is working great no issues at all, i bought it unlocked and i'm using it with cricket.i will post an uodate once i get to use it more.
the box was not seal but it looks that everything is there and working so far
best phone i've ever owned so far!!!!
great
compre este celular pero no acepta mi tarjeta sim de metro pcs que puedo hacer para resolver ese problema?

thank you so much for great product, and thank you for fast delivering. much appreciated.
not worthy its was not working  .. returned i did not get the full amount.

great phone to use. nice display. good battery life.
it is a best android phone ever. period.
i like the fact that the battery life is much longer and the picture quality
phone is amazing i received almost a week now ...but how comes i end up with a different headphone??worst its giving short edge problem now.

funciona perfectamente. me encanta
very good service and a great phone
the device came with a batery problem, and overheating. please i need a support here.
quality of pictures dont seem as great as advertised
just as expected
gooood
don't like the bixby button on side of phone. just in the way
i had a google phone and liked it thought another android would be ok and had samsungs before but this has more pop up ads everytime i sign in guess no matter where you buy this thing from it will be the same problem

battery doesn't last as reported
battery life is ok. picture is good to see in the phone but on print it is ordinary
one of the best android phones available in the market.

very satisfied with the quality of the s9 plus headset...highly recommended
this is not an unlocked phone! waste of time!!!
not a huge difference from s8 except camera . so if you want to save 250$ , better go for s8 or wait for s10

the earphones and the microphone in the package doesn't work.
love it!
upgraded from my s7 edge, massive improvement.

the phone is amazing bought it for my boyfriend for christmas and he loves it.
i bought this as a gift to replace my son's s7 edge and he loves it. so since he's happy, i'm happy! 😊
lives up to my expectations and so far i have not had any  issues.

only had this phone a few hours but been a samsung guy before (s3,s5active).  this phone is beast.  zero lag and looks/ feels rich af.
the best
great phone love it
good phone.
it was unlocked and i love that
it's perfect. the cellphone included all the accesories. i recommend it.
i love samsung phones this is not the exception. really happy with the purchase.
i bought the s9 directly from samsung.com, and wow was that a huge mistake. i got the phone, switched over my service with verizon and sent the old phone off for credit. the next day i noticed the s9 had some minor physical damage from shipping. i was going to let it slide but thought, nah, i just bought this thing, its on them to fix it.samsung refuses to do anything but a refund for sending back the phone. i cant be without a phone, my business depends on me talking to clients. i asked them to send me a new one and ill return the defective one once i switch my service over. they refuse. i'm blown away. had i bought the phone from amazon, best buy or, hell, even verizon, they would have given me that option. i tried talking to managers, i tried using chat, email, nothing works.the phone itself inst bad, but samsung customer service is disgusting. this is coming from a guy who has their 75"" qled tv, family hub smart fridge, touchscreen washer and dryer, and literally everything else samsung offers.you lost a customer for life, and i loved you guys. what a sad way to go.
best mobil electronic device i've ever purchased..
works well
all ok. great phone great product. recommended seller

aux jack sd card slot got my money
too many missing features. you enjoyed having custom notification sounds for individual e-mails? too bad, ""we're working on getting that feature back to you."" you want the samsung e-mail app to automatically show you e-mails from longer than 6 months ago? nope, you'll have to do a search. does your vip have more than one email address listed in his contacts? oh, we'll just split them into two separate contacts when you import them into the email app! oh, you want that person to show as only one contact? too bad, that feature isn't available!honestly, the downgraded features make this ""upgraded"" phone average at best. pay a premium price, get a standard phone. great job, samsung. i'll update this with a better review if they put back these integral features.
es perfecto..
replaced s6.
bueno
i'm so happy rn all i need is a good case now
it's amazing for what i payed for
fast and easy set up love it already!

this phone doesn’t work
amazing phone. i'm in love with it
good.
great
the phone does what it promises and it's easy to use.
a great phone at a great price.
not bad.
battery life should be more better
everything works as promised
great phone!
the keyboard on this phone is horrible no matter what you change the settings to or how large you make the keyboard. the phone is not as advanced as an ios when working with other apps cutting and pasting, sharing, or simply managing pictures and contacts on your personal computer. i could have dealt with tha t but the keyboard was simply not functional. you have an added fingerprint scan to open apps but you will ah e to log in and reset frequently. don’t forget your passwords!  at any given time you will be required to log in manually more often unlike the iphone.
really amazing smart phone
go this phone to replace my s7. got the 9plus and m loving the upgrade so far. got it unlocked instead of buying it from straight talk. i still use straight talk and works wonders. i want sure what color i wanted blue is my favorite color but went with purple one fell for the color and not regretting it.
an excellent phone.
i. love. it. i waited a week to get this and so far, it's been worth the wait. ordered it new and that's the way it came.such a smooth experience with any new phone and i'm hoping it doesn't get bogged down over time. definitely a better choice than the $1,000+ new iphone, for my budget.  awesome camera and i'm still learning some of the features coming from a motorola.
great
muy bueno
great pone, looks like new
nothing
fast and great
it has a burn in
while the camera is amazing, i was disappointed with samsung's promotion policy. while the seller was listed as samsung, promotions on the actual samsung website did not apply to purchases on amazon.i also found bixby difficult to use. google siri is very simple in comparison
excellent device
i like the phone it works fine
satisfied with my phone
100% satisfecho
great phone, picture quality is amazing, good battery
love this phoneits amazinghave been an iphone fan and user for long long time .this phone is by far way ahead of iphone. i was a little anxious tabout rying out this new phone i have never used a samsung phone before, but withing two days i got a used to this phoneits so easy to use. you can customize it it's got so many features.it even gives you hints while using it.the phone is just awesome. and for those who are concerned about app security all you have to do is modify the apps settings. you can controll the apps access to your content and your contacts also.when i think about the price compared to an iphone xits so much more reasonably pricedthis phone is way ahead of iphonei usually dont write reviews but this phone deserves my reviewtry it, you will be amazedit's an awesome phone.this phone is way ahead apple has a lot of work to dowish i could buy this phone for everyone i knowon a scale of 1 through 5this phone deserves a 7 stars
very nice
perfect condition i recommend it

best smartphone i've owned to date.
calling, messaging and pictures are the best!
fantastic phone
best choise i made
muy bueno excelente!
excellent
nice phone
is overheating, blocking all activities
fantastic phone overall!! fast oreo 8.0 os running. best screen on the market by far! very good camera and speakers! good battery!cons: phone call quality is horrible! i hope samsung will improve this issue with an update as soon as possible. bixby button sucks. portrait mode  cam is not so good as iphone x.
got this phone to replace the blu r1 hd and let me tell you it is a fantastic upgrade! i have yet to delve i to all of the software features of the phone yet but as an all around every day use phone, it's amazing! i tested the slow motion video out while i was in wyoming for a.t. and it works like a charm (except for in totally dark settings, as there's not enough light to activate the feature). should i have waited a few more months for the s10? maybe but i don't regret this purchase as it's an amazing phone well worth the price. will update this review once i've had it for six months.
the samsung bloatware is outrageous and there is no way to remove it. you can disable most of it but it then still nags you to use it. i already bought the phone, why must i use your awful apps? none are any better than the stock android versions of the exact same thing. this phone would be 5 stars if it came with stock android.
okay... doesn't live up to the hype.
i love my new phone. it is the right size and easy to handle for my smaller hands. i enjoy using the ""swipe"" feature on this phone as it can be done with one hand. the phone is very responsive. i haven't had it long enough to learn all the features, but so far, it has worked wonderfully and met my expectations.
i bought it as a gift to my sister and she love him!
not only did i receive a european model instead of a us model, but this phone did not have cdma capability to work with verizon (despite what the review questions/answers state). the phone does work with at&t which i ended up having to switch to to get it working.
love the new phone. been with the galaxy series since #3. i am with straight talk and this phone is an unlocked samsung so you have to buy a bring your own sim kit which is then bucks and change transfer was quick and easy. phone works great.
i really love this cell smooth scrolling awesome pics great battery life and wireless charging i can't complain..
probably the best phone i've purchased in a long time. would definitely recommend to someone looking for an upgrade, especially if they don't want to pay more for similar performance on something like, say, the iphone x. i almost bought an iphone, and after looking at them both i decided to go with the s9 and i am glad i did. the display is pretty awesome, nice colors, and the storage capacity is great, as well as the added benefit of adding an sd card for extra memory. the speed of the phone is high, even if you have a lot of apps open, probably due to the 4 gb ram. superb performance overall. impressed me for sure.
i bought a samsung galaxy s9+. at the second month in the phone appear a message about moisture inside even i did not put inside the water. it does not permit me to charge the phone by cable. how it is possible if the phone supouse has a ip68 certification. and when i try to make the refund there are a lot of inconvenients because i live in other country.
this is the cheapest way you can buy the phone. new .....dont buy it referbiushed its a waste of money.
phone doesn’t work properly. it hungs frequently
wow, what a phone! everything is instant: web pages, apps, taking pix. battery lasts a long time, screen is amazing... just click ""buy"", you'll be so glad you did.
coco
it works great
i upgraded from the s5, and i can tell you that the phone is the best phone on the market currently. i've been a loyal samsung customer for years, and when i hold a phone for long term use i really keep it until something is worth purchasing. where the iphone lacks the s9 plus makes up for. the ram, expandable storage option of 400 gb's, and beautiful display, & somewhat ok price(the more advance the more expensive technology will be) places the phone already ahead of many phone companies. samsung truly improved upon the phone, and i can say i'm satisfied.
awesome phone. i love it. however i received the wrong color. double checked and i did order coral blue, but recieved the purple color.
great phone, great price.
muy buen celular
i really like it
sexiest phone ever
love the upgrade from s6 to the latest s9+!picture quality, battery life, the grasp of the phone 10/10!
don't buy this phone!!! samsung s9 has a useless battery. i can literally see the battery life decreasing right before my eyes. it doesn't last a full 8-5 normal use. that's without any use of videos and spotify. the phone is fast, amazingly fast. but not worth the money. def, not worth it.a phone must be able to go through a day without running out of battery. and that's cos i disabled important features, like face and iris recognition.terrible. if i were you, i'd stay away from it.
ok
loved my new phone. it arrived as expected, no delay and works perfectly. and it's so beautiful! recommended!
best android smartphone.
muy buen telefono
awesome phone
works great
great phone, loving it.
todo me llegó muy bien les recomiendo este producto
verygood
it runs perfect
nothing to complain about.  transferred my sim card updated and started using.  i really like this phone
a lot of problem whit it and only in 3 mounthfilm in 4k dont soport more of 5 minutes, dobr impot if used a micro, this dobt work good and take put off and put on to work.
great phone, everything works perfect but i think they should fix the battery life it doesn't get drain fast but they could make it last a little bit longer and could be the perfect phone
like the phone still learning how to use it.  i do not like all of the features. i am not really tech savvy
very good!
sólo duro 2 meses en óptimas condiciones despues empezó a fallar el mic
perfecto ..gracias..
love it
worth every penny
i really need to return this item, i cannot hear anything without using the speaker.
excelente
good phone
great for every day use, gaming, everything you need it for bascically
everything works great
brilliant device. i absolutely love it.
it's perfect for sending noodles
worth every single penny

the phone is was it says, but if you just throw a si card in the additional benefits that comes with purchasing from a provider does not work, for example with at@t i do not get 4 lgt speeds as the phone was just an unlocked version.  very disappointed with that so do your research and find out what samsung says it will do vs. what it will really do if not purchased from your provider.
la pantalla se pone gris y no desploquea
love it😍😍
has a bluetooth connection issue with blue tiger headsets that samsung is aware of but has yet to correct
love it!!!
everything is okay except for the fact that my video calling feature is completely missing. called samsung to fix and they said it was a phone company issue. called my phone company and they said its a samsung issue. completely frustrating !!
everything about samsung galaxy s9 is awesome except my volume controls were not functioning sorry 4 stars
i purchased the lilac purple phone sunday afternoon and it was delivered monday morning. the phone was new, no damages as others have talked about , with all parts and accessories included like you would get if you purchased it from samsung.com. i also chose the bundle which included a 128 gb mini sd card as well as a fast wireless charger stand. the bundle was at no extra cost so the price was $839 plus tax. great deal if you ask me.  i am coming from a samsung note 8 and there are minor upgrades from the note 8 but those minor upgrades was worth me buying the s9+ . the phone is snappy, the sound due to the dual speakers makes a world of a difference. the camera is better than my note 8 and the ar emojis are fun. once the note 9 comes out, i will be sure to compare that against the s9+ but in the mean time, i will switch between this s9+ and my note 8 as my daily driver. (its something about the s pen on my note 8 that i can not let go. great phone. i would reccomend this device.
i received this phone and out of the box, i felt it would be a hard phone to keep a hold of if your hands are damp. i also had some issues within the on screen keyboard. i did like the fact that you could tel the phone to play a notification tone while on a call. i also like the fact you could turn off the call connected/disconnected tones.the phone also has some other things i just can't live with. the phone would play a notification tone whenever i would connect an bluetooth keyboard and or a hard wired keyboard to it. i couldn't find a way to turn that off. i contacted samsung and they told me that is just the way the phone works and there wasn't a way to turn that off. us customer service from samsung in my thoughts is lacking at best.i also got the notification tones when i turned on/off the voice assistant for blind people to use the phone. thhen on top of that, when using the voice assistant, i couldn't get the caller id to repete it would only say it once and that was it. i tried quite a few caller id programs and none of them worked when using a bluetooth headset to get the caller id to speak every 5 seconds or so. without a headset connected by bluetooth, they worked.the finger commands for there voice assistant for the most part don't work while on a call. example: if i'm not on a call with voice assistant running, i could triple tap with two fingers and get status information like for time, network, wifi etc... while on a call it says nothing. same way with a lot of the other commands they don't work.to me for a blind person, i would stay away from this phone as the way it currently is.
the phone is awesome. highly recommend it...the phone arrived without any damages...the delivery was couple of days late though...the box had all the general accessories that you get with the box
i love the phone, but it had a nick in the finger print scanner straight out of the box. the past 3 phones i've had have been from samsung and i've never had this problem. i would give it 5 stars but, i can't pay this much for a phone and expect a scratch here or paint missing there.
compre el equipo y tiene poco q lo empeze a usar y la verdad no estoy conforme por que todo el tiempo se le va la señal de datos de el internet debe de ser defecto de fábrica también en muchas ocasiones en el día me quedo sin línea de teléfono y quisiera el rembolso de mi dinero no estoy conforme con el producto si apenas mando este mensaje es por q quería ver que relamente tenía la falla
great phone, brand new out of the box
it's not even fully unlocked because i can't have verizon as my carrier. i'm lowkey mad. refund time!
*** important ***if you’re coming from iphone, this phone is gonna wow you when it comes to display panel, camera, wireless charging, android flexibility (widgets, etc), business applications (calendar, email, etc)./ but /.if you’re a heavy imessage users and love apple ecosystem, battery life (iphone x better than s9+), and the thin square feeling when you hold the phone (iphone x sits better in the hand) then you may not like this phone or any other phone..i got it as a second phone to my iphone x, and the camera & screen on s9+ kicks the iphone butt hands down!!.4 stars because the battery life!-update-changing to one star because as of june 10, 2018 this phone still running android security patch from feb 2018! do not buy samsung phones as they seem to fail to push updates on time leaving you vulnerable to threats! shame on you samsung!
in mobile networks, under apn, it says tracfone reseller!  for this price, i did not want a reburbished phone. not only thiat, but the mms messages do not come through and i can't for the life of me,  find out how to write a message...i'm sure that's something i've overlooked though...all in all, i loved my galaxy s5.  if i could find a way of charging the battery, i'd continue using it, but the prongs are all screwed up...don't get me wrong, i guess this is a beautiful phone and all for techies, but it doesn't do what my old phone did. i wish i could find a new galaxy s5. but i'm sure they're all refurbished too.  i'm just really disappointed. a lot of the features just don'[t work on my phone...not worth almost a 1000. going to return.
this product was not as advertised, the faq's stated that this was available for use on sprint network, but when i took it to the sprint store they told me the particular phone i had ordered was not compatible with sprint.
this is a great device!
everything ok
this phone is amazing. don't even think about it, get it.the only thing to envy from iphone is the dynamic software navegation.otherwise must be the best phone on the market nowadays.
galaxy s9 was stolen from the package.
have had to replace it three times now
the smartphone is amazing, but the charger died in the second day that i used it.
i buy this for my wife  she love it  thank you guys for keeping that good job
the phone is great and i upgraded from my galaxy s6 plus. the only problem is the volume for notifications ( text messages etc.) is terrible. if my phone is in my pocket i can't hear it. there are a lot of complaints about this online. i wouldn't purchase this until samsung fixes this problem. i've only rated this 1 star to make sure it's noticed.
the galaxy s9 is samsung's 2018 flagship phone that currently runs on android's latest version. this device is powered by qualcomm's 2018 845 processor. there is a headphone jack and a usb c port that charges the phone from 0% to 100% in 1 hour and 45 min. the phone has 3 buttons: a power button, a volume control button, and samsung bixby (voice assistant) button. one of the biggest changes from the s8 is the camera. the s9+ has a dual camera that performs well in low light. some of the camera modes include auto, video, hyperlapse, super slo-mo, and food. the camera produces amazing images and 4k 60 fps video. for unlocking the phone you can use a pin, password, pattern, fingerprint, iris, or face. the phone has wireless charging that allows you to lay the phone on a pad without plugging it in. the curved screen on this phone is phenomenal. one interesting inclusion to the phone is a heart rate monitor that is next to the camera. this can be used in the samsung health app. the phone is thin and light and has a great feel. samsung has done a great job with the s9. the s9 is a great price phone that i highly recommend.
 smoothest samsung experience, truly the market leader for android. used xperia z2 and lg g5 each flagships of their times, paid full release amount for both phones. best experience so far. i used wave ii and samsung corby (was disappointed with both) gave samsung a chance with gear s2, got impressed hence tried s9+ refined software and redifned flaws of innovation in any successfull flagship. i didn't have it delivered but it's an awesome device!!!
when i first bought the galaxy s9 (thru xfinity mobile), i was very much impressed with its graphics, camera, and just overall sleek design. the os is very responsive and easily adaptable. and for its price, i find it to be a great quality phone. unfortunately, if i couldve done things differently, i would've bought an s8. it seems, that as a new model, there are still kinks that samsung needs to work out.the battery is very weak. it doesn't even last half a day (12 hours) with moderate use. also, the design can sometimes make the phone screen very easily crackable because of the raised edges (the phone case that i had bought could not protect the phone when it fell to the ground).
i had a galaxy s7 ans iphone 8 and purchased both a galaxy s9 and s9+ ... the camera on the samsung destroys all of apple's product offerings. that was one of the main reasons in getting the phone. i still think the apple os is far superior to android, and there are glitches galore. turned off all notifications but still can get an app or two which will notify even when do not disturb is put on. here is the odd thing, the s9 that i have seems to preform much faster and have a better camera than the s9+ on several occasions i used both and there was a huge difference in speed and pic quality. i would take the s9 over the s9+ screen seems sharper and the larger size is not worth is, horrible bixby feature! my galaxy s7 made me a samsung customer, the s9 is making the apple 8 seem more appealing and i prefer the aspect ratio of the screen on the apple. speakers are better on the galaxy. for the price through, the apple is the better phone except for the camera.
returned the item as did not get akg earplugs in the box.
love it so far, earphones are the biggest downside to it, that look pathetically made and sound bad but overall the phone itself is a beauty
the phone came without the charger. plus it gets very hot when being used
phone appears to be in mint condition. delivery was fast. however i received a sprint version of the phone wich is not compatible at all with verizon. will have to return. 10/22/18
i went for ""premium"" by getting an s9+, but am rather disappointed.  first, there's huge amounts of bloatware.  i ended up disabling over 200 packages on the device that i didn't need/want.  then, i couldn't ""root"" it.  hey, it's my device; i should be able to do whatever i want with it including putting on a custom rom.  the curved screen is actually a negative - i can't get a good screen protector for it.  finally, the s9+ screen is actually smaller than the nexus 6p i had before.  going back to a google phone next time.  i loved them in the past, and am kicking myself for changing.
lets start with the positives. it's fast, its responsive, the camera is good, ample storage and usb-c. also has a headphone jack which is sadly scarce in 2018now the negatives. the biggest one is the rounded edges of the display (and the reason why i will probably be selling this phone). they make it impossible to hold the phone with one hand, as it will always detect your palm as an imput and mess up the touch sensors. it also gives a warping effect for any video being watched, so the edges are always deformed. also this screen scratches way too easy, i have only had it since april and the screen is already scratched to the point where its intrusive. had a note 5 since launch day and it had not a single scratch on the screen, vs this which was getting scratches within a few days of getting it.now lets talk about bixby and the bixby button. bixby is a waste of space, as the original siri worked better. not to mention google assistant also is on the device, which works a lot better. now when i tried to bind google assistant to the bixby button, but this is the next issue, you can't remap the dedicated hardware button. i thought samsung would of learned from the s8 reviews, but i guess they didn't. don't worry, they made it to where you're able to ""disable the bixby button"" where basically it puts it on a 3 second press rather than a tap, and otherwise remains active.now for just some things that don't classify as ""negatives"" but i just personally don't like. the 18:9 or properly called 2:1 just seems weird, and it pushes the top buttons a little too high for convenient use i have decently large hands but still finding myself straining my thumb to hit drop down menus or open notifications. also 99% of video content is 16:9 or 21:9, making 18:9 weird for bothi also prefer the dedicated hardware buttons of the older galaxies, as you either hide them, which means in order to have a home button you need to swipe up. it is always popping up rather than having me scroll when i swipe up, which gets incredibly annoying extremely quickly. the other option is to lock the buttons to the screen, which just makes no sense, as not only do you waste battery powering them (since they are white with a light gray background), but you also get burn-in since its an oled display. also at that point whats the point in onscreen buttons, you could just have physical buttons that work better and allow front fingerprint scanners.all in all there are some very strong positives about the phone, but they get completely outweighed by the negatives imo.
i only gave 3 stars because this phone did not come with a sim card tray. it just has a gaping hole where it should be. so when i took it to verizon to get my number and info transferred to it, they couldn't do it. there wasn't one loose in the box anywhere, so it just didn't have it. i searched the many reviews for this item and i didn't see anyone else mention this problem, so maybe my phone was an anomaly for not having the sim card tray. anyways, i had to order one online and once it arrives i can get my info transferred and test out the phone.
love it
i like tis
i have owned two samsung phones i don't know why i bought an s9 after i got my s5. the s5 as it received updates it would run slower and the battery life would barely last 4 hours after 1 year. i have now had my s9 for 4 months and it is starting to go down the same path. the worse part is i try to refuse the updates but now samsung forces them upon you. i contacted them for help and all they said was we recommend you do them and then nothing more. i bought an android because i thought i would have freedom of software use and to refuse updates, that is no longer the case. next phone will be an apple iphone where you can refuse updates and they have better privacy protection.
i have now purchased 2 - one right after the other. not from here. the litany of problems - and i will have to summarize...1. battery died to 3% first day. no gaming. no nothing, except talking for a couple of hours and taking a few pictures. truly.  2.) ringtones would not work for texting, unless i was talking on the phone. this was before the master reset.  otherwise, i just got the vibration and ""aaagh). again. it was nothing i had done or not done.  called carrier - again - consumer cellular - and was told to do something you could not do to this phone - hard shock - was told to take it to target. i did not get it from target. got a supervisor - we did a master reset. after that, i could not even use it as a phone. no texting. no phone calls.#2 phone. messes with my files. ringtones won't work with texting - unless i'm talking -  the battery bleeds like nobody's business. i don't game. i don't bank. i just got the bloody thing because my j7 went bad... and i wanted a larger screen.  this thing tells me that the ""badges"" will show with i receive a message or phone notification. they don't. again, not my bad. this is beyond glitchy.don't do it.
after receiving the phone i tried to activate through sprint and it wouldnt work by using my current sd card. went to the sprint store and bought a new one. still didnt work. went on sprints website and typed it the imei number and it stated it will work on the sprint network. called customer service and gave them the iemi and they shipped me out a new sim card. called to activate the new sim card and it works now ! so my suggestion is call sprint give them the iemi number and send u out a sim. other than that the phone is nice however the camera is super dark when trying to use superslowmo
beware, this unlocked phone does not have advanced calling or video calling capability.  went from a s7 to this s9 & went backwards in features.  the seller info should declare these deficiencies in their sales pitch.
pros:everything an expensive phone should have (great camera, display, sound, processing speed, etc)headphone jack!micro sd slot (memory expandable up to 400gb)!available for pretty much any carrier i can think of in the usa (unlike other great phones like the one six plus)android os so more options for those of us that like to mess with devices (and lots of great apps not available on ios)very good looking phonesuper fast data usagesuper fast fingerprint unlock""mehs"":battery lifekeyboard a tad laggy imo (can be improved or even changed if you mess around)bixby (has soo much potential, but it kinda sucks rn, and that bixby button... why)a few apps should have a bit more optimization when compared to iosar animoji isn't as good as the iphone x's version (i mean, idc; but some might lol)face recognition is meh compared to the iphone x'scons:price... this, and the iphone 8 and x are too expensive... i still bought it, but still... (if you're tight on money, buy an s8 or different new good android phone. and if you're really tight, buy a good used s something or sort of recent iphone)fragile, had to buy a case and screen protector day onelike 2 bloatware apps but you can remove them thankfullyoverall, i don't think i'll ever pay 800+ for a phone again even though i keep mine for three years before i replace; i'd rather do something better with that money. however, it's a damn good phone and i do recommend it if you keep your phones for a while or you're someone that needs the best phone every year. compared to the x that some of my friends have, this phone is better imo. the x does do a few things better, but i still personally prefer the s9. coming from an iphone 5s, it's obviously a huge leap for me in terms of phones lol. if you're like me and want to try android rather than going back to ios, buy a good phone like this one (or the huawai p20 pro, one six plus, basically a good android phone) and you won't regret it. will i stay with android and/or samsung in three years? i don't know, but if things keep getting better as they are right now for android, i sure damn will. :)
i have owned apple products for over 10 years now and loved them at the beginning. i thought i would never switch to another product, but with the increasing price and little new innovation on the new products i decided to try a new product. i came across samsung and after much research i decided to try them out. i got the galaxy s9 and all i can say is wow! the camera is amazing i can take high quality pictures and adjust the lighting to fit the background, the battery life lasts forever i go 2 days minimum without having to charge it and i am on it constantly. the face id and fingerprint are great, i can even use the face id in pitch dark and it works! storage is unbelievable i store over 7k pictures and still have room for apps and lots of contacts! overall this is such a great phone i can honestly say i will never go back to apple.
samsung does not care about customer satisfaction. for them customer-centric culture is a very foreign idea.  this is my experience. i will never buy samsung electronic device again and will convince all my friends and family to avoid that trainwreck also.bought this phone new in july 2018, at best buy. phone started to act up couple months later, not taking up the charge, finally turning into a brick. and since then it was a road through hell of samsung (questionable) quality and dealing with the worst customer service i have ever encountered... it is unbelievable, because i expected samsung to be on par with apple, but boy, am i disappointed!so - it has essentially been the following cycle: would not take charge -- repair (2 weeks) - would take charge for a day, then would not take charge - - repair (2 weeks) - would take charge for a day, then would not take charge - - repair (2 weeks) - would take charge for a day, then would not take charge - then i finally decided to call customer service again, but demanding refund, being fed up with this whole brand altogether. it's been quite a ride with those guys, too! it took them first a few days to reply, oh sorry, i take it back - to do nothing, then i called last friday (12/07) demanding refund again. then i was told 48 hrs for decision. then nothing, so i called wednesday, after 72 hours and was escalated to someone else who told me it is up to five days, so i need to wait until friday 12/14 (today) and they'd call me with the decision. so i waited till friday's late afternoon because - of course - nobody called, and after being elevated again, spending about 2 hr and demanding information, i was told the phone cannot be refunded, not even exchanged! only repaired again (because they have policies that say that main board has to be replaced). next week i was supposed to get this phone on an international trip. now i am stranded without one, i just haven't got some $700's around to buy new phones anytime i feel for it.it is unbelievable that they have some unrealistic policies and it does not matter that phone breaks 4 times (the same thing) and they would not replace it, let alone refund it, cause ""it wasn't motherboard"". my communications with even 2nd level manager was just as that - pointless. banging my head against the wall of some corporate baloney - rather than being cared about as a customer who does genuinely get hit by their product poor quality.go for iphone instead!!!  maybe the phones aren't androids but at least they have some true customer service out there!
i had an iphone x but i sold it for this. the iphone x was a huge disappointment. i used to buy nothing but apple products, but i realized how far behind apple is. this phone has a much larger display and higher quality than the x. plus there is no annoying top notch at the top. the camera is better, i took pictures on both phones and the samsung was the only phone to pick up the fine print from a picture on my wall standing 12 ft away. the iphone x was blurry and the print wasn't legible. this phone has an incredible aperture to take crisp pictures even in low light. i don't believe its oversaturated, it all depends on what area of the screen you tap on and the phone will adjust the colors accordingly. overall this phone probably has one of the best cameras on the market.the specs are good, you'll be able to multitask without any issues.the battery life is about average for me, it's not as much as i would like but it's not terrible either. i use my phone a lot for business, emails, video etc.. it gets me through the majority of my working hours around 7 hours of on screen time.coming from an iphone user this is much better!
this is a great phone with a lot of cool features and a top-notch camera, but i could do without bixby and the overwhelming number of useless apps on it.  in addition, price-wise, it is not exponentially better (10x) than the blackberry z10 that i switched over from and suffers from the following issues that take it down a notch:-google play doesn't download the album art if you transfer music over from your computer. it's not the end of the world, but the z10 wasn't missing any album covers in its library.  i downloaded a pay-for-play music player and pushed google play to the next page because i wanted whatever album art i could get.  without it, i find it kind of bland.-i am astounded as to why e-mails, phone calls and texts are all in different places. the s9+ should have a hub ""stream"", similar to the z10.  i found that i needed to download the blackberry hub for android feature because it provides the user with one stream of e-mails, phone calls and text messages.  blackberry hub for android is the best thing since sliced bread and it is available either free (without ads for 30 days and with ads after that), and 99 cents a month (without ads), thereafter. from the human factors perspective, this is something that samsung should be offering, especially at its advanced rate of development.-when a calendar event opens, there's no option to ""snooze"".-playing music with earbuds was a little disappointing. the blackberry z10 had a built-in optional booster and the sound quality was much better with richer bass, even with a $10 pair of earbuds.  the s9+ does have very good speaker sound, though.i bought this phone because i thought it was time to upgrade to an android-based device that could run more apps, especially from the proprietary blackberry o/s that is going or gone extinct.  the s9+ is a very nice phone, but it is a little lacking and not flawless.  i am one that will probably not use it to play pokemon or for any gaming.  the core features i use it for are phone, e-mail, music and some android apps.  it's nice having a phone that can do the latter, but it would also be nice to have the best of both worlds.
nice phone/camera but it is a super slippery fragile fingerprint magnet.  case was late from amazon, slipped out of my pocket18 inches off ground and the screen cracked.  weak.  i like my note 4 better.  bit of buyer's remorse for me.
like many products these days it's all about the marketing and hype.  i've had the phone now for over a month.pros:speakers are loud and clearheadphone amp is 1.4x more powerfulsome interesting tweaks in audio for dolby atmos, tube amp, etc.display is outstandingcons:bixby button is an annoyance. the placement is such when you use the power button you hit the bixby button which imo is a useless feature.samsung bloatware.  knox, samsung music, gallery, etc. compared to google and what's on play i just want to delete them but can't.os updates!  the half-hearted joke is if you want an updated os, buy a new phone.  this includes security updates.samsung should concentrate their efforts on updating the os and security and forgo the lousy samsung apps.would i recommend the phone.  that depends.  if you love audio, then yes this is a good choice.  if you want updated software, speed and smooth opertation i would look elsewhere.
very good phone but i give only 4 stars because there is no ir port. even my old chineese phone had one ! i used it to control my air conditioner.
i bought 2 of these for me and my husband at best buy the unlocked us version and when i got home neither get signal 1 bar if lucky. we went to the city and in the larger city and there we get signal.. i wish someone would have warned me that the unlocked version gets little signal with at&t now i'm giving people a warning at&t gets horrible reception
literally the best phone i've ever had, i loved it so much i decided to upgrade to the s9 plus version. here's my layman's review on both.pros:- the night photos are where this phone shines, definitely able to get every detail possible in low lighting.- battery life is massive with both phone: s9 has a 3000mah / s9 plus 3500mah- plenty of ram: s9 has 4gigs/ s9 plus 6gigs. both perform very extremely well but 6 gigs worth of ram seems like overkill as 4 gigs from the s9 suffice with little to no slowdowns.-  headphone jack on both version. also comes with some sweet akg earbuds.- ar emoji is relatively fun and great to show to people interested in checking out the phone- thin phone- 4k video quality- great speakers- samsung pay, literally can be used anywhere that accepts cards as it mimics the magnetic strip (not like google pay that relies on the ereader).- live translations with bixby vision- (plus version)  live photo mode. really great feature, and editable-  (plus version) 2 rear cameras with optical zoom at 2x and digital at 10x, and dual capturecons:- while night photos are amazing, daytime photos can sometimes appear overly saturated.- there isn't a noticeable size difference between both phones.- what is the point of bixby? really difficult to incorporate it into my daily life without actively thinking ""i should give bixby a try""- while thin, it's somewhat heavy.- besides the camera, there isn't a massive difference between s9 and s9 plus.verdict:as stated above, i love the s9 so much i upgraded to the plus version. both phones run extremely fast with little to no slowdown, even having several apps open does little to bog it's performance down. photos look fantastic at especially at night with both versions. my only issue is the new bixby button: it's not something i would actively use but at least users can disable this feature. overall it's a lovely phone, s9 works just as well as the s9 plus but lacking a few features with the camera.
great phone. no problem there. problem is that this particular phone from this particular vender is a sprint phone and will not work to full capacity on verizon network. in particular, the voicemail icon for verizon does not work on this phone. there is no icon for voicemail.  i called verizon about it and they said that since the phone was made as a sprint phone, there is nothing they can do about it. in trying to help me out, verizon told me that they could not do a shared screen process to figure out the problem. i am not willing to spend this much money on a phone with so much potential only to discover that the phone was made for the wrong company by whom i receive service.  i will be returning this phone to get a verizon compatible phone.
the camera will not autofocus on my s9, and it's been a known problem since it came out early this year. still no resolution except ""send it back to the factory"". wish i had known this before i bought it.
this is a typical samsung flagship phone. it is well built and feels premium on hand. the picture quality is great. shoots even better in low light. this phone has a lot of features and can be quite complex. blue light filter, dolby atmos, edge light, always on and more. i am a simple guy and have never found these features useful. but slowly i started playing with them. definitely useful but not must have.why did i give 3 stars?too much samsung bloatware and the bixby button is hell of annoying. the fingerprint and face recognition are not reliable. face recognition rare works. the phone battery tends to die over night in standby mode if i only have 10% left.--update after a year--the battery is horrible. barely getting 2-3 hours on screen a day. i had to charge 2-3 times a day. not going to buy a samsung again.
phone frequently starts talking out loud (even if in your pocket or bag) because the dedicated had button pushes up against something. you can follow on-line instructions to disable the voice talking, but every time the phone auto-updates the operating system (which is forced upon you), the ""bixby voice assistant"" is reverted to default mode. so, phone starts talking out loud at random times again.do everything you can do to avoid this phone. do not buy any phone with ""bixby"" associated with it. samsung thinks it's smarter than you, so they took away your ability to disable the voice thing permanently, and they made it impossible to re-purpose the additional button for anything. total garbage.
had problems activating it through verizon but finally got it.  great camera.  pretty much the same as a  s8 with a few cool upgrades.
if you've already used or owned an s8, the s9 is going to be a very familiar device.  same-fish design, same glorious samoled display, same 18.5:9 aspect ratio, etc. dont expect a drastic change from the s8 going to this phone.however, there are improvements such as a dual aperture camera, which isn't an apparent change at first until you dive into pro mode, a stereo speaker setup with the earpiece finally playing media when watching videos or playing games, and a better fingerprint sensor location. the bottom chin of the phone is also a bit smaller than it is on the s8 so there's a little asymmetricism going on when you rotate the phone sideways but hey, no dumb notch right? samsung's skin is still drastically different from google's vision of android but serious work done with the s8 to improve performance is still present and i actually prefer the aesthetics of samsung experience, the new name of the software skin compared to stock vanilla android oreo.only downsides i can see are still average battery life and the general use of gorilla glass 5, which is more shatter resistant but quite a bit easier to scratch. there's two or three microscratches along the front glass though it's just the oleophobic coating and it's nowhere near the sensors, not to mention it's hard to see. that might just be me though as i'm rockin' the phone naked. curved glass is also pretty much just for aesthetics and having an option to not have them or at least just have small curved edges would be more preferable but not a big issue for me.either way, the s9 is a definite option to consider if you're planning to upgrade to a new phone anytime soon.edit: added more photos
i bought 2 samsung galaxy s9 back in march from samsung.com.my first issue was when they charged me for my exchanged s7 device that they claimed had physical damage but from the pictures they provided showed nothing more than normal wear. calling and calling did no good to get anything done and just run around in circles.  they couldn't even provide the imei of the returned device to prove it was even the one that i sent to them.i went to sell my samsung galaxy s9 because i was so mad from this experience.  i sold the phones that should have been unlocked since i paid full price for the phones.  but the phones were locked to t-mobile and t-mobile couldn't unlock them.  i called samsung and they couldn't unlock the phones either sending me in circles.  i asked the reps why they would send me a phone i paid full price for locked and why they wouldn't unlock the phone.samsung has the worst customer service and i highly recommend getting a google pixel or another android device.
i gave it 4 stars because there is no perfect phone, if there was they wouldn’t need to keep creating new models. i purchased mine elsewhere but exact same model and love the slim design. i’m comparing it with my present iphone 7+. i’ve only had the samsung 9 for 7 hrs but it’s definitely top quality. however, i paid $600 but got a $200 rebate from a little known and new website called invisible dot com.  it gets better, their plan is unlimited and on verizon, and truly unlimited, and no data threshold where it throttles down. it starts and stays at 5mbps the entire time period but it’s great for streaming hd and works as a hotspot. lastly make sure you buy a radiation proof cover not just an rfid one, the radiation from 4g is proving to cause tumors  especially with bluetooth earpiece and 5g is even worse, lookit up.
s9 could be a wonderful phone but the os sucks at this point. phone os traps you in delete mode for both messages and email, only way out is shutting the phone down and repowering up, at least once a day. additionally phone comes bloated with google everything with permissions for way too much. settings are multi layered and manual is useless, eventually you can modify settings to meet your needs, if you do not it is setup to eat battery power, and data at amazingly high rates. if they can get the delete traps fixed then the phone would be acceptable or maybe amazing, can’t see that yet. maybe after they do some more fixes. i have had two system upgrades so far..... hoping for some sanity and stability soon..... please
the s9 plus is nearly as silly as the iphone. samsung has managed to make an impractical phone that looks sexy. for starters, the battery is glued in! three replacement batteries kept my old s5 alive for many years. now i'm looking at $100 to replace the battery in the s9 plus. ouch!what's with those curved edges! my screen already has a couple of scratches and i still can't find a screen protector that doesn't piss me off. at this rate, i'm going to need another phone in 6 months... but perhaps that's what samsung is hoping.it's not all about length; it's how you use it! when holding the s5 in one hand, my thumb doesn't reach to the top of the screen; it's now a two-handed device. plus (pun intended), it's too long for my jeans pocket and it jabs into me when i bend at the waist.it takes great pictures. other than that, i'm missing my s5.
i decided to move to android after 5+ years with apple. main reason i bought the s9+ was the camera.you can get along with the android way of doing things, but what really pissed me of was when i tried to backup the photos i took in my macbook.actually i have *returned* this phone after struggling an entire day searching an easy way to backup pictures on my mac.after trying 5 different apps (including some weirdo chinese apps), trying with an sd card and everything, it was clear to me that this phone integration with a macbook was a big no for me. oh, did i mention that some of the files got corrupted when i moved from internal storage to micro sd?
pro:fingerprint sensor works like a charm.the quality of the photos is beyond top notch.the phone fits well in my hand and doesn't feel bulky.it comes with plenty of storage, which can be expanded with sd cards.price range won't break the bank and gives you a quality phone.cons:get a case for it. the back of the phone can get marked up rather easily.the battery drains annoyingly quick, even with battery saver options on. it's the biggest and only real flaw of the phone and i wish the battery saver options were a bit more open to allow you to pick and choose what you want to do.overall, i enjoy the phone and if having a longer battery life is a must then i'd recommend getting the s9 plus because the battery life is quite a bit better. other than that, it's everything i want in a phone.
never have i ""hated"" a phone. however, samsung has made that happen.between the annoying bixpy, that always pops up and can not be deleted.....to the annoying home button, constantly being pressed when navigating pages that have button presses at bottom of screen.....to the beveled ""edge"" glass that has cracked 3 times, due to cases not being able to protect it....finally, the battery life is weak compared to my son's motorolla and wife's pixel!no thanks, on the s9 series!
i upgraded from a htc one m9 to the s9 and i am glad i did. the camera is phenomenal. every picture is vibrant, the layout of the phone is easy to navigate, the battery is good. it gets me through the day usually. the speakers are good if you get the phone set on the right eq setting. i love the display, how big it is and the headphone jack. overall, this phone will not blow anyone away but it is a very solid, reliable phone which i love using every day.
the camera is amazing. the phone itself is loaded with worthless bloatware that you can't delete. samsung tries to force the user to use ""features"" like bixby, that not only take up memory, but also slow down the phone and do not anything useful.
s9+ with echo, echo dot, and samsung smartthings home kit for only $1k?? i feel like i stole from amazon. i love my s9+. i was happy with my s7 edge and was holding off on upgrading until amazon caught me with that prime deal. the camera is amazing. looking back at my pics from my s7 and comparing them to the pics i take with the s9+ is like a night and day difference. even after some time i'm still finding new things to do with the phone.
worst phone i have ever used. samsung took a fully functional operating system and stripped out all the good features to replace them with samsung services that require another login. basic features don't work. i get terrible or no signal in areas where i used to have great signal. i haven't changed carriers or my plan. i'm constantly having buffering issues i never had with my nexus 5x. this happens on cell network or wifi.
will not work with verizon sim using straight talk.
i upgraded from an iphone 6s when that died. this phone is a big disappointment. the main complaint is the touchscreen. since it goes all the way to the edge it often adds 0 or p, especially if i use my thumb. the auto tire in to my ford is also buggy at best. usually getting a new phone is great but this one has been a big disappointment. i'd avoid it if i were you.
don't drop it! the back is made of glass. drop it and it will most definitely break. pen is a gimmick. if you want to draw or scribble it's ok, but you can type faster so the pen is pretty useless. while it's nice to have a larger screen it's kind of awkward. that said, the phone works flawlessly in every other facet.
just got my samsung s9 today and i wonder is this genuine by samsung? coz i got the phone made in china and not in korea and i got a headset but its akg and not samsung headset can anyone answer me.
an amazing phone with an amazing camera and screen. if your stuck between this and the iphone x i would definitly get this. the battery life is mediocre just because the quality and the size of the screen drain it. however, there are many options to help prolong it. a beautiful phone.
when the phone arrived excited to use it then boom it does not work! it is an unlocked phone they say but it really isn't. their customer service stinks and are no help.
i've had this phone for 16 days and it's now dead. when it worked, it was slower than my iphone 6 plus. had trouble with texting that i thought was due to software lag. seems others are facing similar problems and it's likely a touchscreen problem (dead zones). samsung already issued a statement that it's working on the issue. my phone is also completely frozen. even if i reboot, it freezes at the samsung screen. i asked samsung to send me a replacement but they refused and referred me to repair facility.  it's currently at the repair shop for the 2nd day. very expensive inconvenience. avoid this handset.
i had the samsung galaxy s7 since 2 years ago and it was a great phone, but the battery was bad since day one. the s9 in comparison is like heaven and earth - with one charge, it last me the whole day at work and then gym. besides the battery, everything about this phone is just great. there's nothing negative (as yet) i can say about this phone.
i feel like i downgraded when i started using the phone. bigsby is probably the most insignificant a.i. i had ever used. i dislike a.i., because i see no benefit in it. humans are already lazy enough as it is, and now this. let me (a.i.) learn everything about what you do every single day so i can help you make you day more manageable 👿. disabled that thing and there's a stupid button on the side that literally stops everything and makes that piece of human insignificance design turn on and take over. please stop the a.i. bullshit and give me a phone that is actually upgarded internally as it is externally. it's really sad to see u.s.a. really bottlenecking cell phone, food, drinks, clothes, cars, and even little simple every day use items. because if it's not american it shouldn't be in america, americans are funny.
no me agrada
i was very excited to receive this phone, a long overdue upgrade from my previous one. when it finally arrived i took it to verizon to have a new sim card put in and was shocked when my account was flagged for fraud. after some calls from the sales associate to various other deparments we learned that the phone i purchased was in fact a stolen product, purchased from a store and resold as new on amazon with no payments made. it's useless, no sim card will ever work with it because the device itself has been registered as stolen on verizon's network.
screen, camera, and battery are incredible and the headphones that come with it are pretty decent. if you have big hands, it's kind of hard not to accidentally hit buttons since the screen is the whole phone but that's a minor complaint.
i have had nothing but trouble with this phone.  it turns off and on on its own, i can't get data to work half the time, it's slow and i want a refund or an exchange.  but i can't get amazon to help me.  i paid $900 for a paper weight.
the phone was great since i had upgraded from the s7 but the screen seems to be very fragile in my case the phone screen cracked while being in my pocket and protected by tempered glass and a phone case after this i called my insurance and they sent me back a new phone for a deductible of $200 the new phone broke in the same way as the first one in less than a week although this one was not protected by tempered glass after seeing booth had broken in less then a month i contacted samsung customer support something i would never do again since all they did was waste my time i was told i had to send my phone to be inspected and they would repair under warrantty. i sent my phone to them and it arrived at their facility two days later. after 10 days i had not received any information from samsung so i decided to call. when i called i was informed the phone was processing and i would recieve it in 5 buisness days, later that day i finally recieved notification they had my phone processing and it would be ready soon. now 2 days ago i recieved a bill for repair costs of 247.89 way more than my deductible because my phone was not covered by warranty.
had the iphone xs for 2 weeks. returned it because i thought 1k was too much. got the galaxy s9 plus for 250 less. i love it. the resolution is amazing. fast, smooth. i found there isn't really anything the iphone can do that the s9+ can't, but there were a lot of things the s9+ could do that iphone couldn't. why people pay more to get less phone is beyond me. . usb-c... headphone jack, the resolution, nfc! great phone, no regret. using the $250, i got the samsung galaxy watch...win.
just opened the box a half hour ago, the phone is brand new. i brought the phone for my boyfriend’s birthday and this is the cheapest i’ve seen the phone after searching for a week. i chose the 2 day delivery which was pricey but worth it because it came a whole day early. i didn’t use the phone yet but i did  turn the phone on and it sounds good and looks good!
i was concerned it wouldn't work with verizon based on some reviews...they were wrong and i am sooo very happy with my awesome prime day deal on this fast and fun phone.  slipped in my sim card, did the samsung switch app and was good to go!
i purchased this phone as an ""upgrade"" to my wife's google pixel phone. (actually my son got her phone when his htc m8 died.) anyway, it's the second worst phone she's owned - and we have to go all the way back to the motorola photon to beat the miserable user experience provided by the samsung galaxy s9. as usual, samsung has placed the albatross of bloatware heavily upon the otherwise promising hardware. i'd root it in a minute if she'd let me.
don't buy!!  two things are good... the touted good camera and processor speed. sound is marginal and maybe worse than previous issues.  it is narrow, terribly so such that 1/3 of my time is spent correcting misspelled words no matter what keyboard i try. yes typing on the horizontal position is ok, but awkward and you have to use 2 hands. samsung dropped individual text notices and so now everything sounds the same when notified making you pull out the phone, unlock it, then find out what the notice was for... drivel!! at least weekly i have to restart the phone for the dail numbers to work, otherwise it does not put calls and texts through. the screen touch is over desensitized with a screen protector sometimes requiring multi-touches to respond even when in the sensitive mode.  it reminds me of microsoft's mellium pc format.
the galaxy s9 is a great looking and working phone, but i challenge you to try to figure out all the camera features they show in the commercial.they show all sorts of things like 'swing' and 'boomerang'  and 'super slo-mo', but the only feature i can actually find is the slo-mo.  the other features are buried somewhere in the camera and samsung provides zero instructions on how to use them.i'm currently scouring the internet to see how to activate these features, but it is a major fail for samsung for not providing guidance in the box.
i used to get samsung products because of their google integration.  now there is a button on the side that you cant turn off without signing up for samsung's service.  i will no longer be purchasing samsung products.update: there updates continue to try and push their products.  even going so far as removing your settings and replacing them with samsung offerings.  will never buy samsung again.
camera defective from factory. ordered from amazon.  rear camera can't focus when selected. manual focus does nothing. 20 seconds later it works fine. starting to happen more often and of course i'm a day late for returning it. no goodupdate... ubreakifix did the repair on the camera. it was a hassle, but it works. the shop owner told me what a hassle it is working with samsung, i'm just glad that i didn't have to mail it in for the warranty.
i love everything about this phone, except for one thing. the battery drains way faster than all my previous phones. i've used the iphone x before to play fortnite and the battery on the iphone x didn't drain as fast as this phone does. it might be that fortnite isn't optimized for android or something, i don't know. i've also played a lot of asphalt 9 on this phone and the battery drains quickly too. i recommend getting this phone still, if you're not worried about the battery. this phone has a excellent camera, although the google pixel 2 xl excels in some areas. a nice feature about the camera is that you can change the aperture. the screen on this phone is the best! the screen is so beautiful and hq! i took my iphone 7 plus out to compare and i just notice the ugly bezels on the iphone screen. i don't think i can use phones with bezels again after using this amazing phone! the phone is very fast, of course with a snapdragon 845, you can expect it to do anything. runs fortnite perfectly fine if you want this phone to play fortnite. multitasking is very easy. all in all it's a great phone, worth every single penny you've spent. if you don't care about the battery life, this is the perfect phone for you.
better battery life than any other phone i used...photos and video turn out clearer than even the newest gopro. 4k is crazy clear and pictures are great too but i own a sony full frame camera so i typically dont use it alot..i will say the selfie camera lacks tho but thats because my previous phone was a sony xperia ultra xa1..the selfie cam was better than the rear one. lol speakers are like actual speakers too..pretty clear
good phone and camera, however tons of bloatware clogging everything (cpu, ram, sd card), not up to date android version (8.0), very slow on safety relevant updates. bixby is the worst, you need an app to block this useless crap. all in all good phone if samsung would just listen to customers.
after doing a fair bit of research i am pretty sure that many phones people are getting are fake chinese knock offs. i would not recommend taking the chance on this. they look similar but there are subtle differences that say these are fakes.
what were they thinking when they designed a cell with a raised glass screen? my pure gear cover simply cracked from the strain in less than a month.
great phone below market price. phone is truly unlocked unlike what other sellers claim. everything works just as good as a new one from verizon but 200 dollars less
try this.... record about 10 different videos in different areas with everything set to auto and resolution 1080/60 fps. now transfer the files to your pc and look at the captured frame rates. right click--> properties--> details--> frame rate. you will see that each video probably has a different recorded frame rate. if you really want to see the camera fail, take it out to a trail in the woods and film there. i guarantee you it won't record at 60fps, but instead something like 51fps! hoping there's a software update for the camera soon.
low battery life
not worth it. i'm on my third galaxy s9. many issues. had galaxy phones for past 7 years. this will be my last.
battery life is just like very other phone not great but not bad either
excelente producto y atención.
después de un retraso el celular llego en buen estado y con todos los accesorios comprados. muy buen producto.
excelente, rápido envío y tal como se describe.
love the phone it just can get scratched easily but you can just put a case on it. this phone is for you!!
i received the product just fine, but verizon was unable to activate it, since it didn't even recognize the device.  since the device was not shipped with a sim card, which is not mentioned on the webpage, the employee at the verizon store used a standard verizon sim card to try and activate it.  all in all, a big waste of my lunch hour!!  it is already being shipped back...
honestly this is one of the best smartphones i've used in a long time. snappy, ui is good, screen is gorgeous, camera is great, pretty much everything to expect when purchasing a 800+ smartphone.the real complaint i have is the speakers sound when cranked to full as on edm and some hip hop( these are the main genres i listen to) the bass levels drastically drop. a bit dissapointing but cranking it down a little bit and back to business as usual.anyway its a great phone and i would definitely say it is a contender for one of the best phones of 2017-2018.
""hey, you know that part of the phone where you hold onto it? i think it's called the side. yeah, we put a screen there that serves no purpose other than to click things when your just trying to hold onto your phone. oops you didn't want to click that button, too bad you didn't just drop your phone.""
quite possibly the worst bloatwear in a flagship phone, coming from a google pixel this phone has been nothing but issues. the smartswitch app took 6 seperate times to finally run. if you like wasting time then this is the phone for you, if not look at a pixel or even the oneplus.
useless bixby feature, completely useless!terrible fingerprint recognitionterrible facial recognition
overall great phone, great pictures, easy to use.  only negative is the charger- i use the charger that came with the phone  yet it charges slowly. a pop up does show saying ""slow charging-use the charger that came with the device."" problem is it is the charger that came with the device!
i was skeptical buying s9 on amazon. i was super stoked to see it was a usa model and not a cheaper model. word as promised and i’m not upset about this buy.
i will say samsung galaxy s9 is great, specially when is unlocked, i can use it for any carrier. i bought this phone as a spare phone, but i'm a loyal iphone user for #life.
having both more ram and an sd slot, after my 16g iphone died, is absolutely fantastic.
so it is going to be pretty easy to make me happy at this stage. it is so nice to have a battery that last days without needing to be charged.so far so good, just getting used to the upgrades from an s5 to s9. but it was only $100 more for the s9 vs the s8 - so it seemed like the logical choice.we will see how it goes going forward.
i love this phone and the features that come on it. my only complaint is that i am having trouble locking the screen position. outside of that, it is a really good phone.
way better than we expected. we considered purchasing iphone x instead and am so glad we went with the s9 plus!
love the phone and only reason for 3 stars is verizon wont cover insurance for some reason. had to use a 3rd party to get coverage
i bought this mobile last week thinking it is a new one but it's not. it is a refurbished piece. the performance is not good. i'm very disappointed with my purchase.
back in march, i switched from an lg v20 to the s9+ because the screen on my lg began to bleed through. big mistake. the samsung pales in comparison to the lg. there's no tap or knock to wake option, the fingerprint sensor is finicky, scrolling through social media is a chore and i found myself growing more and more aggravated with daily use. in short, i paid the phone off early. when i was in the store explaining at how dissatisfied i was with the phone, a samsung representative was present.  upon overhearing my gripes, he just said something about not pleasing everyone. while that's true and there is no perfect phone, samsung sure has some catching up to do with lg.  much better user interface on lg and the fingerprint sensor isn't as finicky.  do yourself a favor and check out the v30 or the g7.  skip the s9+
great phone. switched from a iphone. bought from at&t
my daughter bought  this phone, a new one and we took it  to metro pcs to active it. its was impossible cause it's showing  that its looked. so i was able  to use it. hope i will have a refund or find a better solution to this problem. feeling frustrated.. money lost.
battery stop working good as 4 month of use.
i bought a galaxy s9+ which these days is samsung's flagship phone. i was stupefied to find that sidesync doesn't support the s9 family...i then tryied samsung flow but i cannot used it either as windows pin login is not available on my windows 10 enterprise notebook.shame you samsung, i regret my buy...
s9 fantastic business phine using daily is a pc and a phone great phone!
greatest phone ever...cant put it downlove the color
bought a new phone got a phone that had been opened and had parts missing do not want!!!!
this phone has everything you need!
recently upgraded from the s7 to the s9+ and i'm terribly disappointed. last week, i decided to upgrade from a samsung s7 to a samsung s9+. i even went all in with the bogo deal from verizon and upgraded junior at the same time.rarely have i been so disappointed in a tech purchase! and samsung, i hope you have people watching for this sort of post. i'll be returning. this. phone. tomorrow. major shortcomings include ""bixby,"" microphone placement, and voice recognition.first, the ""bixby"" personal assistant is a train wreck. i don't know who decided that an unholy union of the yahoo! home page and google assistant was a good idea, but they seriously missed the mark. and it can't. be. disabled. nothing enrages me more than software bundles that can't be disabled.second, you have to hold the phone in your hand to be able to talk on the speakerphone, or the microphone is muffled and useless. seriously, samsung?! the whole point of the speakerphone function is to be able to put the phone down.thirdly--and this is the deal killer for me--the voice recognition for talk-to-text, voice dialing, and talk-to-email is just abysmal. these features worked nearly flawlessly on my s7, but on the s9+ i'm flying into daily rages over the garbled nonsense the phone ""hears"" when i talk to it. i have no accent and enunciate very clearly and it does no good. even if i shout single words and go completely over the top on my enunciation, i can't send a single text message of the simplest imaginable words. i spend 50-60 hours per week driving and must be able to communicate hands free as much as technologically possible.swing and a resounding miss, samsung.
purchase as a gift for friend, she likes it and that’s all i know about it..
perfect.
bought this for a friend of mine. i only got the best positive feedback.
el productoo no me ha llegadooo, salee negocioo cerradoo,
hi, i've got from tmobile as an ""upgrade"" for my s7 which i still have , no issues for 2 years .this one dropped once from a  low distance in a week after i bought it and cracked on the back!!! before you invest huge amount of money into this kind of junk check more appropriate options, unless you're really careful do not recommend this phone
there is no phone in the box.
great product best phone i've had
everything about this phone is traffic!
i have instagram and a youtube page and would love to promote this product
based upon product details, questions and answers, etc was led to believe that this unlocked samsung s9 would work in verizon. however, it does not. bought this s9 in prime day and received several other items as part of the bundle. now i have no phone and will have to pay a much higher rate because i waited for 'prime day' to purchase. very disappointed.
absolutely worthy phone
its perfect
satisfied
upgraded from a note 2... the touch sensitivity was actually better on the note... brought it back to the dealer and he said i did not close out enough. still the same. i would not recommend this phone. to me this phone is a bust.
turns out to be a sprint phone
recently got rid of my iphone 7+ and made the switch. i did this because i didn't like that apple wouldnt leave anything alone and kept updating it until it was slower and less firmilar. the iphone always worked though.  the s9+ is a constant fight to get something to work how i want it. the apps don't run nearly as smooth as they did on the iphone.  on a positive note, it's got a nice camera. this phone is a great piece of hardware with terrible software. i'm excited for my one year lease to expire so i can get another iphone.
i bought my galaxy s9 weeks ago and  the battery last less than 12hours they said is new but im not sure about it...... i want my money back!!!
for some reason, my battery is not good. not sure if it isn't the original one, but it is not working good at all.
i just bought this phone and everything is soooo amazing. it's worth every single penny. :d i have a lilac purple s9+ and i absolutely love it.
so far so good.  only had for a couple of months.
phone is a pos
love it.
product arrived very fast and works great. i am very satisfied.
i bought it on march and it still the best in my opinion
definitely a great buy!!
very pleased with good service.
way too much for a chinese cell phone. there's others with the same specs.
not fair to spend like 5 - 7 more dollars, and right after the purchase the price drops.the item itself is ok.

why is that me samsung galaxy s9+,doesn't have a samsung headphone, instead a different name on it?
nothin phone was broke when it arrived
i just got this phone through my work. i've owned the galaxy 4,5, and 7, so i figured i'd stay with the same brand and get the s9. i've had it only a few days, and the screen is so unresponsive when clicking and scrolling and apps are spontaneously shutting down.i do love the creativity behind this and camera features, but getting the darn thing to work is quite frustrating.
plug garbage. can't use any normal android. plug. would not have bought. returning to these dopes
ok, i looked at my old s6 and decided it was time for a new phone, the s9 has better security,a slot to expand memory, newer camera and a bixby assistant if your to lazy to press app. what it doesn't have is an ir blaster so i can use it as a remote. the upgrades i didn't needare there, the one additional item i liked they removed. this is an expensive downgrade for me.
i recieved the wrong color. :(
i am completely perplexed that this thing has such bad notifications.i use lg, pixel and iphone, saw it all, and had reasons to abandon samsung long time ago. every cheap lg just worked better than samsung for me.decided to try s9  due it's small size; the only other option was google pixel but its display is just too bad. the only thing worse than the display are those large bezels, and the need to find and install some 3rd party apps that would allow to auto-hide the soft buttons, when you want to get more out of that abysmal display. heck, except in youtube, the buttons are always  there, making that 5"" screen more like 4.5"", in a body that's wider than s9. what a nonsense..anyway, s9 notifications:no notifications on locked screen:  i have to take it, unlock, swipe down (needs both hands) and then i'll see notifications. iphone/pixel/nexus turns on the screen for a few seconds, i can see if it's anything interesting, if not i go with my work, the phone turns off the screen.limited notifications on locked screen:shows two lines vs full screen + scroll on iphone. some settings available that don't help much. androids in general are not that good as iphone, as they always are trying to bundle notifications. if you try to avoid that, at least they'll be bundled by the app.raise to wakeup and show notifications:with iphone/pixel/nexus, i would pickup the phone and the accelerometar would wake up the phone, showing  notifications. as soon as i put the phone down the screen goes off. when i pickup s9 nothing happens - again unlock and swipe procedure...notifications while using the phone:some message comes in, the phone does nothing. sometimes it vibrates, sometimes it sounds, and sometimes it does show the popup.all this regardless of notification sounds settings and silent mode. wtf ?app icon number:not reliably cleared or set on google inbox, outlook, google play, to name a few.note: some of these problems are tied to notification sound being off. so, they tied together sound and visual part of the notification system. maybe that's good, but it's them who tried to distinguish between visual and sound notifications in  settings. naturally, these certainly are two different things as their use model is different.  samsung knows that but they failed to get it right. it's understandable why they failed - read below about the sw update i got.  anyway, sometimes some things work for a while (e.g. after i change different options) but then get broken again. classical samsung...all in all, i am relying on my pebble to show me notifications.some 3rd party apps allow coping with most of these problems but they are unreliable, sometimes power hungry or not persistent. so why samsung doesn't care ?  well, just two days into preorder (i already got my phone) and i get software update with important bug fixes. so, these guys are trying to deliver the software with zillion options so naturally it's not yet ready and is full of bugs. they start lots of things, and  rarely nail a single one.first crazy option: edge screen notifications. you got to check out that hopeless attempt to implement ... ...i don't know what.second crazy  option: turn on screensaver when screen is off. it's screen **saver** for a turned off screen ? wtf ?third crazy option: always on screen showing me the clock (duh) and that i have notifications... sure i do! i receive about hundred or more different notifications daily. the phone is always in front of my face when working and driving - show me the notification, not an icon saying there's one...fourth crazy option: you can enable vibration when you pickup the phone, if there was some notification. duh, what about showing that notification.i was thinking working hard getting different 3rd party apps until i fix the notifications to suit my needs. but still, that would leave me with the curved screen;  curved screen means there are no cases that allow comfortable grip as the case cannot extend fully above the lcd. i find much larger phones more comfortable in my hand - e.g. samsung's own s8 active, pixel 2 xl with a proper case are easier to handle. so, my argument that i should get s9 because it's the smallest premium phone doesn't apply anymore.in addition, curved glass easily breaks as the glass is exposed. so many broken s8 phones around. i hear they've put much better **glass** into s9.  duh..and not to forget the screen protector - there are no good glass screen protectors on the market (yet). i don't know what's wrong but glass protectors requires you to increase the screen sensitivity in the phone settings. well, that option doesn't work good. i type fast and often use my phone for work email. i can't go and repeat every other letter. also, glass screen protector, as of today, don't cover the full screen. in fact, they have some glue on the sides for the better grip, actually covering the whole curved edge.all in all, i am returning this one, and will wait to see what lg g7 will look like. otherwise, will wait for pixel 3. until then, iphone 7, with all it's problems, is still a better deal for me than s9.some notable positive sides:samsung internet browser is just awesome.lcd is excellent. even better after apple forcefully reduced the lcd brightness on iphone 7-,  to ""help"" aged batteries. don't know about iphone x, should be also close to 700nits like this one.starting camera with double click to power button.photos *with flash* in dim conditions are ages ahead of the iphone.home button is there - just press glass a bit harder.speakerphone is much louder than iphone 7.---------------------------------------------------------update on screen wake-up on notification:googled a bit to see what can be done. apparently, people mention that samsung differs from ios and stock android in that you should depend on edge light, led light, vibration, sound, but not screen wake-up. so, samsung tried to be more clever than google or apple. lets see if they succeeded; i google a bit more and there are posts going back to 2015 about different issues:1. some people actually  like that there are no screen wakeup on notifications. but their screen is waking up ! s6, s7, s8, s9. people suggested lots of thing but nothing helped those poor souls.2. some people are like me and would want notification - just can't get them.3. some people argue why would somebody want to be in group 2. duh, what a bunch of schmucks - that should be a configurable option, to satisfy both groups, and no discussion needed.3. some screenshots show a very promising option in the security settings  - ""wake up screen on notifications"". well, that seems like it, except that i don't have such option.4. there are reports on all kind of apps that will screw up the notifications. while googling, a verizon help page for s9 came up, showing that the screen will not turn on when... outlook is installed. aaaargh. i need that one for work. anyway, after removing it and after doing the factory reset its still the same for me.i am reducing this to one star due to so many bugs. started with notifications, but i don't know what else is there...
update: well, i've had my s9 plus for almost 2 mths now & i see it more every day! it's so fast compared to my other phone! i'm really glad i took the plunge & ordered this phone.i was really nervous about ordering this phone after reading the reviews, but after receiving it, i'm so glad i ordered from amazon. i didn't order from a third party seller. the phone came packaged in a huge box surrounded by air pockets plastic. everything was sealed and looked brand new. still, the first thing i did was contact samsung to verify that this was a new phone with a valid 1 yr warranty. they assured me that it was indeed new and had a 1 year manufacturers warranty. when i tried signing up for prepaid service, the imei number only worked with verizon. after chatting with the sales reps online, he assured me that wifi calling would work. i was doubtful after reading multiple reviews online, but figured i'd it didn't, i could go with t-mobile next month. i called samsung again after signing up with verizon and the rep at samsung said my phone was unlocked & would have worked with any carrier. yesterday, when i got my verizon sim card & put it in, no wifi calling. i checked again in a couple minutes & boom! i had all kinds of features that weren't in my phone before including wifi calling and hd calling. so happy with this phone. it's lightening fast, the screen is brilliantly beautiful & the pics it takes are unmatched. plus, no unnecessary apps that i had on my galaxy s7 edge from at&t. love this phone.
samsung makes the best displays on the market, and i love almost everything about this phone... except the display.  the picture quality is excellent, but these curved edges and rounded display corners have got to go.regarding the curved edges - they have no functional propose that couldn't be achieved with a flat screen.  no matter how you hold the phone you'll get glare at one edges or the other.  images and text message the edge get distorted.  on-screen buttons at the edge are problematic at best.  the curved edges make it virtually impossible for a case to properly protect the phone if dropped.the rounded display corners are ridiculous.  in many apps it really makes no difference, but in some there's just content you can't see.  ironically, the claimed display size of 5.8"" is measured as if the corners were not rounded.the fingerprint sensor placement is poor (though common).  if the phone is face up on a table i must pick it up to unlock it (or position my face directly above the screen for other biometrics).everything else is great: performance, responsiveness, display quality, battery life - all the things you'd normally expect from a flagship device.  but these other bizarre design choices are baffling.
my last phone samsung galaxy note 2 lasted more than 4 years and it is still working but some apps wont work on it so i had to upgrade to a new one.  new s9 is beautiful. miss my pen but new pen one is ridiculously huge so i went for s9 without pen. beautiful, smaller size, weight phone. i had extra money to spend, so i bought this one unlocked. unlocked is the way to go, so when i am out of country(usa) i can buy another chip and put it on it. plus there are no carrier specific spams on it. it is faster since my note 2 was ageing and slowed down. else there is not much they can put on it. camera results are amazing. music, i find no difference. i hope this is the last of the smartphone, since they cannot find more to put on a smartphone that will hook falks on it.
i wanted this phone a year ago! finally got it! but was undecided after receiving it whether or not to keep it because of the newer s10 that was going to be released. i just love this lilac color! it is a well needed upgrade! my old phone had only 16 gb, i had to constantly delete the few apps installed just to get another one. with this s9 worries no more for it is 128 gb! i love the quick smooth response! i was able to update too!  i was also able to use a case i bought for it thats not available for the s10e yet. (they have all the cool cases on ebay.)  i knew of the s10 & plus but not of the s10e, oh well, my bad....after playing with the s9 i just couldn't send it back....i think this s9 is just as great so far. good sound, picture, etc...works for my needs thus far!
we received the international model of this phone after purchasing two from amazon, supposedly unlocked. i was on the phone 2+ hours between amazon, samsung, and total wireless (our service provider, uses verizon network) figuring out why the phone wasn't working properly. the iemi numbers were not clean. the phones could make calls but the 4g data was not working because they could not be fully registered. the samsung rep said that the phones are an international version and the total wireless rep said they will not work on their network. now i have to return these phones. what a waste of time. i'm so frustrated!
i love samsung phones but not this one. i upgraded from a galaxy 6 to the 9. it has so many issues that i just went back to my 6. positive: transferring everything from my 6 to the 9 was easy peasy. this phone has an incredible battery life even when i play games on it several times a day. that's about the only thing i really like about the phone. the thing i noticed the very first day was the picture quality was blurry on all my photos that i took. that's the main thing i use the phone for. i tried several settings, but photo quality still remains to be an issue.for the first few weeks, my phone would actually show me notifications as to when i had emails, but then that just stopped. i checked every setting and even turned on the sound for the emails. nothing. i did the 7 ""fixes"" suggested to fix this including downloading different launchers, and doing a reboot of the phone (several times). nothing. i need to absolutely need to know when i have emails especially now that i'm taking classes again. even if it did show a notification, if i opend the email app, it would delete the notfication. this wans't a problem to keep something in notification status on the 6. fingerprint scanner doesn't work majority of the time. i just look like some idiot stroking my phone. creepy. haha. in addition to about 15 other issues listed about this phone, my app that unlocks my house when i arrive stopped working. tried everything to fix that. nothing. i thought it was the app. but the minute i switched back to my 6, the app started working again. so, now i believe it's because of the 9. this has been the worse phone i have ever had. i would not recommend this phone to anyone!
the phone does every great, except the actual phone part is horrible.  i’m probably going to return it.  calls drop every day.  it won’t dial out unless i restart it.  this happens whether the call is wifi or via the carrier.  this did not happen with my last 6 phones.  same carrier for last 6 phones, but this ""flagship"" is a pos with a capital ""s"".  in addition, it does not hold its value.  it’s unbelievable to me that a oneplus will sell on ebay for 95% of its purchase price every 6 months when the new version arrives.  but i bought this on cyber monday for $547 plus tax with a normal price of $899 and it’s selling on ebay in the 400s!  that’s ridiculous drop in value compared to oneplus.  my biggest complaint is failure to dial out.  i’ve tried rebooting.  i’ve tried resetting everything.  i’ve called my carrier.  while the camera is exceptional, it fails at being a phone!!!!!!  update jan 24, 2019 - i received a replacement.  the replacement had the same defects as the original, plus the volume from speakers was lower.  it is unworthy to be called a flagship.  it looks nice.  it has a nice screen.  it has a terrific camera.  it is a lousy phone - it’s main function.  it is filled with samsung bloatware.  and the predictive swipe texting on both phones was the worst at predicting words of any phone i’ve ever owned.  the keyboard sucks in swipe mode.  horrible.  i’m going to oneplus (no bloatware) or apple (security and just great products).
before receiving my phone i received an email from reliant cellular (the seller) giving me instructions on how to resolve an issues should any arise. this made me feel good about the purchase because i got the info to quickly get help in the case i need any.the phone i ordered was as described, new, and perfect. i easily took the sim card out of my old phone (i used a pay as you go phone plan through simple mobile) inserted it and started using it. i will be switching plans because my carrier just doesn't cover enough areas that i tend to travel, but when i do switch, again i will be able to just swap out the sim and continue where i left off. i was initially concerned during start up that it wasn't unlocked due to a ton of mentions and programs for verizon, but it is unlocked.my battery lasts me all day, unless my kids are watching endless videos. the screen and picture/ video quality is amazing! i'm so happy with this phone!! i'm still finding different things to play around with and personalizing my phone and i've had it for a week.
before i start i need to say that i came from a windows 10 phone and a flawless working mobile platform. however, after a long time using windows phone it's clear that a android phone is quite a shock, because everything is on your shoulders to get it customized/optimized. regardless of this, my biggest contra is on battery life. this is unbelievable, max 12-14hr if you use wifi, this is not top. my last alcatel idol 4s windows phone last forever comparing to samsung galaxy s9+. the good thing is, you can customize and make it more ""microsoft like"", microsoft applications including office, onedrive, cortana and outlook do not come preinstalled, but when you can personalize the device with microsoft's productivity applications so every customer is able to work, play and connect on their device when they leave. the design is nice, the camera pretty awesome, took some test photo's and they look great. to install everything and import stuff such as text and/or mms messages take time (and additional tools). without customization the default installation made the phone super ""wordi"", just sending from every app messages etc. so, i recommend to check this first to fulfill your needs. the screen is stunning, clear picture. and it's good to see, samsung is catching up with former microsoft hello technology to have fingerprint, iris, face recognition. thats a very good feature which is also used in additional apps such as banking. i'm also concerned about ip68 (water protection) because there is no rubber seal protecting the sim and micro sd card from water. bottom line: battery life is for me the absolute negative point, therefore 3 stars
i was so excited to get my new phone... i opened the amazon box(in tact) to find a samsung galaxy s9 box. the outer sleeve of the box was dented and ripped. first i was disappointed because i did not order a used phone, i ordered a new phone and expected a new looking box. i then took the sleeve off and finished opening the box only to find that there was no phone in the box at all, no phone, no charger, no nothing!!!!! i am so disappointed and furious i could scream. i spent a lot of money on the phone. i called amazon and the woman told me there was nothing they could do. she told me that they needed to start a 3 day investigation. no reassurance, nothing. they told me to call them back in 3 days. i am guessing they have some internal theft going on?? not sure what else it would be. i order from amazon all the time. i rarely have an issue, but this makes me rethink ordering from amazon, or online at all. has anyone else had something like this happen???
i've had many samsung phones and liked them.  but my most recent phone was an lg v20, which i was also very happy with.  the camera glass cracked after 2 years, and i decided to get another samsung.  overall this is a great phone. i wish it was a little larger, so the same screen resolution yielded larger text and icons.  i know i can adjust it, but on the v20 everything's a bit larger at the same resolution, because the usable screen is larger. but if you have good vision at that distance it won't bother you.one complaint i have is bixby and the samsung bloatware.  i bought this unlocked so i wouldn't have the carrier bloatware, but samsung puts on plenty of their own, and along with bixby, you can't delete most of it, just disable it.  it continues to nag me to use one of the apps.  i don't know why they want to cram this down the user's throat.  i already bought the phone.  if i thought samsung had better apps, i'd download them.  but none of their built in apps are better than google stock apps or other 3rd party. i'm not sure what the reason is for trying to push their apps on users.  i guess to avoid this  you have to buy a google phone.
upgraded from the s6. love it! fingerprint on back is cool and hidden home button is good too. activated verizon set up all online super easy. i bought a caseology case and screen protector. needed to change the touch screen sensitivity to make it normal (for a while it was difficult to type).
i have always been a samsung smartphone loyalist, but that ends now. it's nearly impossible to change the  artery on the s9, therefore, i will need to buy an entirely new phone in the next year or two. but that's not why i'm giving this phone (and samsung) one star. the microphone stopped working, so no one can hear me when i  call them. from what i have read, this is a major issue which samsing has failed to address. i tried all fixes to no avail, to include restoring the phone to its factory settings. very frustrating for an almost $800 phone, which is not a paperweight. samsing needs to acknowledge and remedy this software glitch.
ok, so all of the reviews mentioning verizon had me kinda worried. don't be. i have verizon, received phone, installed nano sim from old phone and signed into google, and poof everything was there without all of the verizon bloatware. no contact with verizon at all for set up. visual vm seemed to be an issue for a lot of reviewers, open the included samsung vm app and push and hold '1.' enter password the first time and then you have an app the looks and functions just like the verizon version.for a guy who grew up with the phone wired to the wall, i am still amazed at the technology advancements made. there are a lot of features on this phone, useful stuff to. just the video and sound improvements alone are awesome as compared to droid t2.first week of use and still learning some features, but very pleased. battery life is great, almost double my previous phone.i bought a combo with a chrome book, wireless car and home chargers and a case and came out $175 less than v wanted for just the phone and all of their bloatware.
moved over from an iphone 7 .if you can extract yourself from ios (easier said than done), this is a great phone.phone itself: excellent call quality. headphones are really nice and there is a headphone jack with no dongle and you don't have to use bluetooth. charges so quickly.camera: fantastic in every way.muzak: am still a little confused on the various samsung apps, esp samsung music which is so weird. listening to music/ videos is really nice on this because of the full screen and the front facing speakers.size: this is a great size ... perfect for me. i am a medium build person with medium sized hands. i did not want a phablet. this phone feels like something between an iphone 7 and 7+ for comparison. don't know how it actually compares but feels smaller than the iphone +.get a case on this thing. i am using the supcase unicorn beetle ... it's thin and grippy.
ive had galaxy phones since the s3, and this is the first disappointment.  yes it looks good and battery is good for a new phone, but the issue is it freezes waay to often.  with such available memory and new software this should not be happening now, given its happened to all my other phones once they near the 2 year mark.  this phone is 2 months old though, not happy.
my husband bought me this phone in the lilac purple color for my birthday,...it's gorgeous! i love the display and the infinity edge. for me this is a total upgrade from the s5 i've been using, i'm so glad i waited! everything shows up bright and crystal clear. even my email looks nicer!the emojis you make using the camera do turn out a bit creepy,...they look like you but not really. at my age i don't think this is something i see myself using too often in chat or messenger. it's fun for all of maybe 10 minutes.the camera is nice, the pictures come out clean and clear. however i do wish all the features were explained a bit more in the manual  to make it easier to figure out. it's nice being able to scroll through the different modes with a swipe of your finger but the how-to's on using some of the different options would be nice if they were printed out in the manual for reference. i'm sure it would be easy enough to look on youtube or google,....haha i suppose this is what happens when you go from an old phone and leap frog over a few generations and find yourself in the future. :pi'm not too crazy about bixby though, there should be a way to reassign the button to something else and remove the app entirely if you choose. i also like my camera settings set so you say ""smile"", ""shoot,"" ""cheese"", ""record video"", or another trigger word,... but unless you completely turn off the voice for bixby  you can't use the voice command on the camera. one feature should not cancel out another,... maybe there will be a software update later on.  or maybe i have completely missed the setting somewhere and will bump into it somewhere after i've used it more?the speakers are excellent, music sounds great and phone calls come through very clear. using speaker phone i actually had to turn call volume down, on my old phone it was hard to hear people talk and the mic didn't pick up very well either. not the case here!i love this phone!  it's a nice size, easy to hold, and looks great! it was also very easy to set up and after i played with it for awhile i found it simple to navigate with a few cool surprises thrown in for me to discover. having read how similar this phone is to the s8 i can understand some people being annoyed at spending all their money and not really getting much more than they already had, but i did read before these were released  that they were similar and if i had an s8 i probably would not have bought this model. for the most part i still feel this is a great phone. i know for a fact i will have a great time taking pictures and videos of my kids and grandkids with it!*3/21/18-  added a few sample pictures,  one is a  close up (approx.12"" away, begging dog wanted my lunch), another a couple inches away, and the others from about 15 feet. no filters just had the camera set to auto and let it do its thing. pictures come out clear and so much nicer than from my other phone. i've been playing with the other features as well and results are great too.using the volume button to snap a quick picture is convenient, it makes taking pictures with this size phone so much easier. i'll have a great time using this camera when the grand kids visit!the lock screen is a little annoying when you have to click the power button then do the swipe screen, but in a way it's useful, my old phone did all sorts of things on its own while tumbling around  in my bag. the hidden home button and the power button are both quick and responsive, either one quickly wakes the phone up but the home button brings up the home screen if you press it when the screen is off. you can always change the time out settings so your screen doesn't click off as fast to give you more time, so not really a big deal for me.this is a fun phone to have. battery life for me is great, i keep the display on bright because it's just so pretty. i also have the time  out screen set for 5 minutes. i just charge my phone once a day and i'm good to go! no regrets with this phone.
you know how excited you get when that package comes with your s9 in it? well it was 100% a bust. i opened it and the first thing that set me off was no charger or any of the extras. once i got the phone out of the box, it was immediately  appearant it was a fake. nothing worked. it was a child's play toy. calling amazon  was a bit interesting because they had me on hold for about 40 minutes. buyer beaware you may pay $700 for a fake. i  requested a replacement which should arrive shortly. i will video the opening  and recommend you do you just in case this happens to you. will update my review on the replacements arrival.
i really disappointed. i used to have i phone 7s plus it falls down and the front back camera no longer. i called apple support they told my it will cost $385 for repairi decided to switch to android and i bought galaxy s9 plus from amazon and i found out it is way behind compare to my i phone 7 plusfirst thing the shape long and thin and i am doubt this screen is 6,2second thing the picture doesn't have more features like i phone 7, ( live picture)third thing you can't move the screen by swipe with your fingerthis just compares to my i phone 7 plus i don't know how i phone 8 and x could be, they should be more advanced than i phone 7
samsung galaxy s9+ unlocked smartphone - lilac purple - us warrantyi'll add to this review after a few weeks of use so this is mainly for sprint users.i inserted this sim which i bought on amazon because i didn't feel like messing with sprint employees this time. the sim is sprint sim simolw406tq samsung galaxy s9, samsung galaxy s9+ search the number, you'll find it. i inserted the sim and followed the activation on the phone, not the website. know your phone number and security pin before you start this and it'll go much smoother for you. it took five minutes and the phone was rocking and i never called sprint.other insights. the camera. wow. they are getting close to slr quality with these lenses. it's not the same but i'm sure i could fool some with it.overall speed, excellent.the plus is one loooong phone. still fits in my pocket just finebixby...... wth is this?that's it for now.
i paid more than $700 and all i got was an empty box!!!  not only that, but this seems to have been a reconditioned unit, or some kind of ""new old stock"", re-handled and re-labeled.  but what i really got was a box that was sealed with factory tape (or reconditioner's shop tape), all the accessory cables and connectors, but no samsung phone!!!  pay $700, get zero!!!!!
the s9 is a beast!  intuitive with great features, i'm very happy with my purchase.
big upgrade from the s6 edge +. unlocked works on every carrier. cdma or gsm.
it's an s9+ unlocked smartphone.
better than ip x
ok so what an amazing phone and yet even with a good case the screen has broken twice. $ 400 to repair. could have bought something else with that money.  the curb is killing me. time to leave samsung until they can make one with a non curbed screen.
perfect perfect ,,, the only one issue is the battery of it was 4000 ma
they had a chance to fix all the laggy, unusable “features”. another forced bixby (it insists upon itself). i have both this and the iphone x. surprise, guess which one just works out of the box (spoiler alert: iphone). i was so excited about this phone, but it has maybe a (marginally) better camera setup than the s8+. it’s at least as laggy as the last phone. it’s not worth the price, flagship or not. if you’re os agnostic, get an iphone. this is way more trouble than it’s worth. it arrives bloated and you can do nothing about it.also, in typical android fashion, you get a less and less responsive device as time goes on. every app you install makes the phone that much slower. this is an android problem, same thing happens on the pixel 2 xl. i should have stuck with the pixel which is uglier, but not full of bloat.it has a nice screen though, but i like the iphone’s screen as much. this is hardly an upgrade, but another disappointment from samsung. maybe it’ll catch fire like the note and i’ll be able to be rid of this phone.
this phone surpasses any iphone currently and previously on the market. i bought it as a second phone just to use for posting pictures for my real estate business. i would take it over ios any day if it wasn't for the battery life. you would have more luck using a sidekick from 2005 plugged into a potato to hold a better charge than this phone. the note 7 (which i also owned) blew up and this one just dies after 30 minutes of use. if you can charge it for three hours to use the camera it a great.. other than that you get a ""battery too low to use flash"" message. after missing tens of important business calls and overall not being able to use the device due to its 45 minute battery life i am switching fully back to iphone.
with use of a case, the phone cannot sustain a fall of 42 inches. the glass will crack.if you don't want to pay for half the phone to fix small cracks, you can try repairing it yourself and break all internal components, when you fail, samsung will refuse to repair it, even though you are offering them money.so, if you have a 100% chance of not dropping the phone...
buyer beware. unlocked phones do not support some carrier features like video calling and wifi calling. i bought this s9 plus to use on verizon wireless and these features are blocked. the reason they are blocked is because it's an unlocked phone and verizon wants you to spend the big bucks buying the phone from them to use all the features the phone supports. it bs really but that's just how it is. so if you buy this or any unlocked phone then you can expect some of the features not to work. i warned you.
i was highly disappointed when i received a locked device rather than ""unlocked"" as advertised. i was however very pleased with the speed in which i received my replacement, which was the very next day. i contacted amazon and the replacement was sent without even having to return locked device first, something that surprised me.there was no damage to the box or any missing pieces, the device came brand new as expected (even the locked device was in excellent condition). it's been roughly 2-3 weeks since i've been utilizing my device, and i'm very pleased with my purchase. i have had no issues so far *knock on wood*, and it was an easy switch moving from the samsung s6 to the s9.so despite the initial hiccup with the phone being locked, the speed in which it was rectified definitely made up for the initial mix up. so overall i'm happy with my purchase.
this is a great phone and i would buy it again outside of all the tracking that google and samsung do on you that can't be removed no matter how much messing with it you do.my only complaint is that verizon says that it is not a authorize phone even though if you just swap your old sim card into it the device works fine.  it just won't show up on your account as a recognized phone with model number that you can manage but atleast you avoid the activation fee.
i took this phone to a verizon store to set it up and transfer my current verizon phone number to the new phone. they checked the serial number and informed me that this phone is not compatible with their network.
firsti want to say that i am typing this review on my samsung galaxy s9 on verizon with full 4g lte. i wanted to point that out to end the confusion.i got the phone, put the sim card from my old phone into this one and after about 10 minutes of updates and verizon settings it was ready to go.i did not need to do anything special and it works beautifully.excellent phone for an absolute great price. i highly recommend this phone. add it to your save for later and watch the price. i managed to snag this phone brand new factory unlocked for just over $500. i am sure it can be had for about that price (if not less once the s10 comes out).enjoy the phone!
received the product on time, however there were no accessories, on further inspection the phone was fake. all accessories were in chinese, it felt like only a weight was inside the device . the back of the device only had stickers for the camera, led and fingerprint reader. just casually looking on the device you won't be able to tell, but once you actually touch it you can feel it. going through the reviews it seems this happens a lot with the lilac version.amazon customer service was extremely understanding and helpful and quickly processed my oder and i was able to get the black version which i am happy with now.
update april 9: i’ve ordered the samsung galaxy s9 phone twice (two separate occasions) and when i tried to register them at samsung, i found out that the phones were intended for the hong kong market and that samsung us would not warranty the phones.  warranty would only be honored if the phone was sent to hong kong. additionally, these phones have specific hong kong parts so getting a repair in the us may be difficult because parts may not be available. i’ve returned both to amazon with no issues.  in talking with amazon customer service, i was told they were going to pull the inventory and figure out where things went wrong. btw, the only was to find out if the phone is a us marketed phone is to call samsung. you cannot tell by model number and only samsung can tell by the imei number.
the phone arrived in an open box so i assumed it had been used before. i noticed off the bat that the bixby button was stuck so i tried manipulating it with a small tool but it wouldn't work. after initial setup, i figured i would try the phone for a few says and it seemed ok. but, i noticed it was not holding a charge. i reread the description of the phone and realized it was refurbished. so i packed it back up and sent it back. waiting for refund now.
the color on outer edges is peeling, sound quality is poor, pics are good, hard to change keyboardsmain thing is the color on the phone and sound from, improved speakers? i have always used samsung and am disappointed with quality of this one. i have had this for 1 month and 9 days. great, not
received my new phone last week. lots of options & lots to learn. my phone, according to my carrier, is a dual sim. i did put an sd card in the other slot.  my model number is sm-g9650. the phone was unlocked and new in box, as described. took a bit for the carrier personnel  to determine which sim card to use and they were a great help in activating the phone. transfer of information from old phone to new one was very easy using smart switch. the first thing i had to do was switch language from spanish to english. apparently, since this is an unlocked phone, i am unable to set up voice mail. i learned this from you tube, but will double-check with carrier. not sure yet about bixby.11/1/2018:  i visited my carrier and personnel was able to install my voice mail. had to set it up ""the old way."" anyway, it's now working and i'm liking my phone so much better!
i switched from the lg v30 to this model because i wanted something smaller. it is more comfortable, lighter.picture quality is way better from both cameras hands down. the phone picks fingerprints easily but not bad. screen is brighter and it gets dimmer.samsung pay is a plus.  android pie update available.  looks like samsung is faster than lg when it comes to updates.phone lags a but when closing applications  on the new android pie with the new one ui. the fingerprint sensor is really fast and the sound is better when using the phone speakers more immersive since the v30 only has a bottom speakerbattery i haven't test long enough.
i bought this phone brand new from amazon... it was very clearly used.  the phone had been set to spanish (us) and already had a folder labeled ""applicacions de microsoft"" on it and the message app spelling dictionary only had the option for spanish (us).  cant trust anyone these days.  on the bright side they included a phone case for free lol! thanks who ever sent me this phone i appreciate that.it is a sm-g9650 (snapdragon 845) cpu but because of that its region is set for china ... not the usa.  so mine didn't come with the ability to do some stuff (wifi calling for example) that you would expect from a new phone.the phone itself is awesome.  i have large hands and its just a little too big to use with one hand for me which is its only drawback.  most normal people would use it with 2 hands but i have to be different.the picture quality is great even when capturing action shots (tried to sneak a pic of my girlfriend but she moved and i made an ugly face for half a second... the picture is so clear its like we planned for her to do that face for the picture).it works with the samsung qi certified fast charge wireless charging convertible stand/pad and does fast charge on it.coming from an iphone 4 this thing is night and day difference but i bet you could say that about any new phone.when i  open apps they open immediately.  browsing the web and watching youtube videos is smooth and uninterrupted... on my old iphone the youtube app would lock up after an hour or so of use.  plus i can download apps again lol!  my old phone was so old it wouldnt get ios updates and its level of ios isnt supported by anything so i couldnt even get my email with it anymore!i did discover one thing that i don't like about it over the iphone.... you cant turn off apps from being able to use mobile data in the foreground (you can turn off background usage).  so if you are on data and you open up youtube or 9gag and start using it its using your data.  on an iphone if you go into your cellular data section of your settings and turn an app off it will not be allowed to ever use any mobile data unless you go back in and turn that back on.  really saves you from using data when you have a wifi connection available but not connected for whatever reason and you start browsing the web.
if you don't mind losing features from your carrier get an unlocked phone. this phone is not programmed with any carriers software. i have lost 5 or 6 options i need with att. att tells me there is nothing i can do and they cannot flash or install their software. my only option is to buy a new phone, unlocked directly from att. this phone is a waste of money and had i known all this prior to buying it, i would not have bought it.
just upgraded due to a stellar cyber monday sale. the phone was just $519 with a free amazon show included. what an upgrade from the s5. i love my old phone. it still works just like it did from day one. but  this.....samsung s9 is by far a better phone than any iphone out there. the screen is bigger crystal clear display. lots of cool new features in emojis and apps that my s5 didn't have access to. battery life is phenomenal! the sound is better then any phone i have used. the curved edges give the screen the largest view. the camera seems very good. still learning some of the new features.  i have no idea about some of these reviews, mine came in a sealed box brand, i called samsung they thanked me for being a loyal customer and said it comes with a two year warranty. i did buy a case and a screen protector. thank you amazon for the great deal! (will work with t mobile, boost, red pocket and att. ) as a precaution call your provider before you order :)  heads up this will not work with sprint they do not accept any unlocked androids. kind of a hassle, so i switched providers.
i received the phone and when i opened i realised the package has been previously opened and resealed.  everything was in the box but no device to open sim card holder and no paperwork  it says us warranty but that is a lie there is absolutely no paperwork.  i have activated the phone and it appears to be working i will write a next review one month in to let you know how it goes.
i bought the samsung galaxy s9 like new from amazon warehouse deals and not an authorized seller. i wanted an extra $50 off cause someone touched the phone but then returned it. i work in education; i'll take any deal i can get. i also made sure the phone came with original packaging (it was stated in the condition description).so far, i am very pleased with this purchase. the phone is lovely. it came with the plastic still on and all the original pieces such as headphones and the little tools for popping out the sim card. it does not come with a charger so i picked some up in a separate order.i have at&t. getting my service sorted was a bit tricky but it is set up and everything is working now. i went to one store and the agent switched the sim card and checked calling service but not my data. i left, i shopped, and then suddenly realized that my internet wasn't working. went to another store but the agents were useless and only wanted to sell me stuff that was irrelevant to my issue. so it goes. i went home and called at&t. three agents and an hour later i rolled a yahtzee and mark the advanced tech guru came on the phone. we did a bunch of stuff on the phone having to do with my imei and apn. neither immediately worked. finally, he had me hang up and turn my phone off so he could ""zap it."" he called me back after, cause that's the kind of class act mark is. huzzah! my mobile data was working without issue.one disadvantage of buying the phone like new is that the warranty was started by the person who first bought it. it does not say anywhere in the amazon description when the phone was first purchased. i registered the phone with my samsung account and it shows that the warranty started in june. i am therefore assuming that's when the first owner registered it. it is beginning of dec. now. if i anticipated really using the warranty (i don't) i might find this annoying.i'll also point out that i bought this phone with my discover during an amazon cashback quarter. the 5% cashback covered my state tax. this saved me an extra $30 that i put toward a microsd card for more storage.if anything goes wrong with this phone, i will update in the future. so far, i am tickled lilac with my like new amazon warehouse deals phone.
too expensive to have such a short life. this s9 was my 2nd expensive phone purchased in amazon. first i bought s7 refurbished. horrible idea! had a short life of maybe 7 months. second time i purchased this s9 less than a year ago, priced around $800.00usd - phone was good, but it started to get slow to reinitiate plus last time it was updating over night, it simply never came back to life. too expensive for such a short life. will not buy any more cell phones in amazon. i went straight back to best buys to get some insurance, warranty and anything possible.
i have not had many issues with this phone thus far. i always keep it in battery saver mode which can be frustrating for lack of certain notifications, but it seems to be fast, the size isn't too big for me, although one handed operation is limited compared to the smaller phone. charge lasts all day without much use without power saver mode. add a fair amount of use and power saver mode and still lasts all day.i couldn't justify getting a gs9 over a gs9+ because the battery life is better, 2 cameras, and an extra 2 gb of ram over the other device. i like this one for these extra features. samsung made a quality phone, and i am happy to own it. i'd recommend charging the battery up to 85%, and keeping it above 35%, which may double your battery life (maintian 95% capacity after 4 years instead of samsung's 2 year guarantee)
i got this phone during a cyber monday sale. considering the reduced cost and the extra amazon device included with the package this was a fantastic deal! buying from amazon also gave me a peace of mind. should something go wrong then i have a path of recourse.the phone was new, factory sealed, and unlocked. it fired up right away. getting it work with mint mobile was a little challenging but that's not the phone's fault. the camera is excellent, especially if you shoot in raw/dng format and process the image with something like capture one or lightroom. battery life is also great but i also don't use the phone 24/7 non-stop.
puchased this phone on pre-order back in march and have been using it since the day i received it on sprint. i was hesitant to purchase a phone outside of a sprint store but it worked out well and there was only one hiccup in activating it. this phone does not come with a sim, which apparently sprint doesn't always carry in the store. after some searching a sim was located and the associate switched my phones (s8 to s9) in about 10 minutes.
it was waiting for me when i got home, and it's perfect. everything is in the box as it should be, all wrapped in cling plastic and brand new. i've only had the phone for a few hours now so i can't make any claims about how well it works, but it's definitely new. some of the reviews had made me nervous but it isn't scratched, used, or missing all together. it even has the smartswitch paperwork, user guide, health warnings, and extra ear bud caps (still sealed). my only complaint isn't with the phone, but with the delivery person. they left it in my back yard for some reason, so my dog chewed into the cardboard amazon box and put some deep gouges in the external s9 sleeve. but nothing important was damaged.
what a great phone. sansung has done a great job of updating thetr android os and this thing is beautiful. fast, great screen, and has sd card capability. this was part of a promotion carried by samsung and alsk by amazon. it included a free samsung ""chromebook"" which has turned out to be my goto tablet/laptop. crazy, huh? very happy with phone connection, messaging and every thing else.
i recommend rs cells as seller to buy from.  i was a little nervous as to how ‘used’ it would look. but it looked new. i think it’s new! no original box or manual or anything else aside from the phone and original charger as described by seller. popped in my sim after cutting it down to size.  all my contacts were there.  all texts gone. had problem sending multimedia text message but looked online to solve problem (apn related).  i haven’t explored everything on phone yet.  so far no major problems yet, knock on wood.i’m glad i took a chance to update my old phone and buying from good seller.  paid 1/2 the price, new, win-win.
the samsung galaxy s9+ is bigger than the s9, and holds a charge very well.  the cameras take excellent photos.  am still getting used to it, different from the galaxy s5, my previous phone.  the curved edge display looks very cool.  a fast moving phone.  lovely design overall.  i got the coral blue which is a beautiful seashore blue.  the phone is a little heavier in the hand than i expected.
product is performing well, but moving photos over is a real problem.  also volume on phone is too low.  maybe this can be fixed, but so far no luck.  very disappointed with seller/amazon.  original order was canceled, not by me as reported, but by the seller/amazon.  when i finally got the phone it cost me $70 more than original order.  i have not yet fought this battle with seller/amazon.
+ camera rocks,+ i like being able to add memory cards.+ love how ell it works support tv's+ bluetooth is fairly stable+/- battery life, the manage function works, but overall i feel like it is degrading quicker than i'd like.- the auto volume annoys the crap out of me.- bixby, this is apple like arrogance having a dedicated button you cannot remap- screen has delicate edges, look great but you must use protective film, causes a loss of sensitivity.- hate kies and all samsung software for file transfer, just garbage.overall - i'd take this over the 5g  for now, it is value for money.improvements i'd like - something that has large music player control buttons for sport/driving.
nice phone. i'm still trying to learn android. a little different than my windows phone, which i loved. this phone is fast. has lots of settings to make it the way you like it. waiting for the new user interface and new android. they should be available very soon. i did a lot of research on this phone before buying. i'm not disappointed. i like bixby which i didn't think i would use but it's handy. push the bixby button and ask for help or open apps, messaging, phone, voice mail. whatever you want to use and it opens. call phone number, call voicemail, create and send this message. very quick and helpful.
i have only bought samsung phones before and this one disappointed me. first off, for some reason the screen scratches very easily. my keys were able to put some significant grooves in the screen. the battery life is worse than last year's s8 and i basically have to keep it on battery saving mode all the time. i have had the phone for almost three months now and it seems to be slowing down. it also glitches alot and some apps refuse to open. overall, for a samsung, not very impressed.
****update 1/14/19****my original review for the phone is below. i have owned this for 1 month and found my phone would not update to the latest firmware, it kept saying it was up to date from july 2018 even though samsungs website showed monthly updates. i contacted samsung, provided the imei number for the phone and found it was factory locked to a specific carrier (not mine and not the one seller said it was unlocked for.) i contacted that carrier and found it was unpaid by the owner and would be locked until that person paid it off, the imei was held against the original owners social security number due to the unpaid balance and they told me to return the phone, the seller was committing a form of fraud by selling me that phone. i would always suggest contacting samsung with the imei number to verify it is fully unlocked before putting all of your info into the new phone.***original review****there are only 2-3 downfalls i have found with this phone and one related to the seller, i bought a refurbished phone and it still had the old phone number registered to it which is a fault on the seller, but also a caution to anyone buying refurbished.the other ""downfalls"" are related to the curved edge screen. it is impossible to find a case that protects the screen on all sides due to this. i have found multiple cases that are raised on the top and bottom keeping the screen off tabletops when face down however the sides are still exposed. the other is i can see a slight flicker on the sides if i turn the phone slightly, this may or may not be with every phone or just mine since it was refurbished.now onto the good!the speaker quality feels like the phone is it's own handheld movie theater. the color is extraordinary. battery life has been better than my previous s7 but not as good as i was expecting for a model 2 years newer and the plus version. response time is impeccable. there is bass with the sound. no lagging whatsoever. highly recommend the phone just note the curved edges are exposed and that part makes me nervous.
first off, the a##hold carrier that delivered it left it on the front porch in the freaking snow and ice- so i was not happy about that at all.  i am frankly sick to death of the delivery people amazon uses, and their delivery promises that aren't kept.  delivery was promised sunday but i didn't get it until today.  i watched up until 8:00 last night when i got an email stating that it would be delivered today by 8 p.m. instead of yesterday by 8 p.m.the phone appears to be new, but i have no idea how to tell.  it looks new, is spotless and my daughter loves it (so far).  i will update my evaluation as time goes on.
this is so much better than my note 4, not that i didn't like the 4. the one thing i didn't notice until actually getting the s9+ is that the security control by knox is within the s9+. i think i read this is a preferred requirement by businesses now for their enterprise cell phones for employees. could be a very good thing for all of us. it does require me to play with it more to find out how i need to ""tailor"" it to settings i prefer so it is easier for me personally. but hey, i love discovering new things anyway. the screen is beautiful for my midnight black version of my s9+, the responsiveness is fantastic and memory space is oh so much better. and buying it unlocked? i find that to be the one thing i didn't expect to be outstanding. i hope and plan this to last me a long long time.
i have a galaxy s7 that i love.  despite being big, it feels nice in my hand and is easy to use.  the s9 with its curved edges was infuriating to use.  my palm kept hitting the side of the screen when i reached across the phone.and i really don't get the point of the curved edge.  it doesn't do anything useful i care about, it just makes it hard to use.  i think samsung decided they had to do something interesting and different to give it a ""wow"" factor, despite it being worse than useless.so my brother says you can get a big case to cover up the edges to solve the problem.  ok, but if the solution is to just cover the edges up, what's the point of having it in the first place???and it's super tall.  which i also don't understand.  it makes it hard for my thumb to reach the top of the phone.i feel like samsung has fallen into the trap where their shareholders just want the stock to keep going up, so it's not enough to sell a million phones, they have to sell 2 million next quarter, so instead of making a good useful phone they are going to make a gimmicky phone to try to attract people with new gimmicks even if they're not useful.i returned the s9 after a day of use and i'm back to my s7.  i'll probably get a pixel 3 instead eventually.
i liked my samsung gs7 edge, but i *love* this phone!  the oreo android 8 update on the gs7e is pretty poky, but this phone screams!  two apps i like but could barely use on the samsung were the microsoft ""arrow"" launcher and the google ""carplay autos"" apps - painfully slow on gs7e, but on gs9+ they scream!  battery life continues to be excellent, better screen, better usb jack, better stereo sound, and also much better bluetooth (i had some devices that were really slow to properly connect on gs7e's bt4.0, but gs9+'s bt5.0 rocks so far).  i wish samsung and google were a little less heavy-handed on insistently pushing their more privacy-invasive features (like location history, etc), and i wish i could uninstall a few gb of samsung cr@pware though...
had to get a new phone, and really dislike the other options. the major drawbacks for this phone are the edge display, which is impossible to find a good screen protector for, and the fact that after recently cracking the display, i realized it costs roughly half the price of the phone to replace.  other than the price of the display and the obnoxious, and seemingly pointless beveled ""edge"", i absolutely love the camera, and the phone is very fast.  the sprint network obviously does the phone zero justice, so you may want to change service providers to benefit the the performance that this phone has to offer.
note that this review is of how the product arrived and first day thoughts, it's not in-depth of the phone long-term.contrary to what a few other customers seemed to have experienced in some reviews, my phone came completely brand new and not tampered with at all. everything worked fine from launch and all i had to do was transfer my sim and sd cards over (i use verizon, the sim works just fine, no need to contact them.) there's nothing i can see regarding damage or issues with the phone related to how it was sent or what could have happened beforehand.i bought this phone unlocked and new in order to avoid the verizon bloatware i never used but couldn't manage to get rid of. it was also nice to avoid the hidden fees attached to new phones bought through providers.my initial thoughts are: it's fantastic.the picture quality is stunning, especially coming from a droid turbo ii (which was a nice phone for what it was, but the screen is so lackluster in comparison.) the camera is beautiful and i could easily say justifies the pricepoint for those looking at the market for photography in comparison to other phones i've seen and i haven't even touched many of the features.the speakers are surprisingly clear and sound great. i've noticed a trend with many smartphones from day one to just have... awful speakers for some reason. maybe manufacturers assume you're using peripherals and bluetooth at all times. regardless, this phone covers that base better than most others.the slim and tall design feels much better in my hand than i was expecting it to, coming from a smaller phone.i love the shortcuts on this android version and just how the entire galaxy line operates in general. samsung has always made stellar leaps in convenience mixed with modernization and the s9+ is no different.as far as bixby goes: i don't use voice commands on phones, whether it be bixby, google assistant, etc., period. i just avoid the bixby button (my one caveat with this phone is part of the hardware being designed exclusively for bixby) so it doesn't apply.i will update this later regarding other things like battery life, communication features, and anything else i can think of after using it for an extended period of time.
i saved a $100 by ordering this from amazon as opposed to getting it through at&t. it connected to my at&t carrier the moment we put the sim card in. the phone is beautiful. i have not had time to thoroughly explore it, but it appears to be working just fine.my phone was sitting on the table this morning and it just went dead. i called samsung support and they emailed me a next day air shipping label. they were very good about it and i have no complaints.i do not look forward to being without my phone for a week. there are no service centers in my state - delaware. i still love this phone.
i purchased this phone about 5 weeks ago. i needed something that was unlocked and that would work with at&t as my samsung galaxy note 4 finally died. the phone has worked perfectly since it arrived. it came new in box with a power cord, wall adapter, and headphones. i did have to take it in to a store to get a new micro sim card as the one in my previous phone was the larger type and did not fit in the slot. the battery life is great and the cell signal comes in with no issues.
a phone with a beautiful glass body with many great qualities. such as the use of dolby atmos for an exquisite audio experience and custom audio settings. the infinity amoled display looks immensely beautiful with vivid colors and deep black. another plus that samsung continued the use of the headphones slot. battery life is great for everyday normal use, and 5he battery saver settings provide options that greatly extend the battery life of the device. samsung pay is a very nice feature especially since it can work in more places than other digital payment methods.
had no trouble transferring apps from my old s4, though i did have to re-enter some passwords.  the cable connection didn't seem to work, but then it found the old phone on wifi and grabbed everything anyway.  the screen is completely eye-popping, especially after setting it to the highest resolution.  blazingly fast compared to the s4 and the battery seems to last and last.  one real annoyance (but still giving it 5 stars): it's really hard to turn off the bixby ""feature"" and it's tied to a dedicated button right under the volume control.  the button can't be used for anything else and is really easy to hit by accident.  c'mon samsung.  the people that don't want it, don't want it.  it should be a simple setting to turn it off and assign the button to something else or nothing.  magnificent device overall though.
i upgraded to this samsung s9 model sm-g960u1 unlocked version from a samsung s7.  the phone works just fine and the transfer of all my stuff from the old phone to the new went pretty well.  while the curved screen has a visual appeal i believe that a flat screen would be both more practical and easier to protect.  in terms of it being a tool, i haven't discovered anything new that this phone can do that the s7 couldn't do.  it comes with something called ""bixby"" that i guess we're supposed to all just know what it is and what to do with it... guess i'm not interested in bixby until i see some information that educates me on what it does and why i might need it... i do like samsung phones and once you've grown accustomed to a company's android interface it makes sense to stay with what is familiar.  if you have an s7 or s8 there is probably no reason to upgrade to the s9 version unless you have money burning a hole in your pocket.  in my case, one of my son's needed a phone so he got my old s7 and i treated myself to a new phone.
we purchased 2 of these devices one was still in the wrapping with no issues and the other had been used, was missing the charger and the adapter piece. both phones worked great but we paid for a new phone and received a used one and were left without a charger and adapter.
this is the best (and most beautiful) phone of 2018, hands down.pixel 3 xl has a worse processor, less ram, worse battery, no equalizer, no dex, no hdmi output, no sd slot, the stupid notch, and is $200 more expensive.iphone xs max has similar performance, no fingerprint sensor, worse battery life, no sd slot, the stupid notch, no dex, and is $400-600 more expensive.note 9 is too big for one-handed use, too big for most pockets, has the same processor as this phone, but is $300 more expensive (tho if u use the spen, that's the best phone for u).seriously, i waited for all the flagship announcements, only to find out that the s9+, announced 6 months ago, is still the best phone of the year, and it's not even close.completely customizable, and just a pleasure to use. the new samsung software is much better than the old bulk in the days of s3 or even note3. i'm coming from pixel xl, and i can vouch for this sw being very lightweight, useful, and snappy.also, the always-on-display is just a pleasure. i don't think i'll want to go back to not having this option. battery life is amazing. i'm very happy with this phone
note, when you purchase this product the name beneath the title of the product is the manufacturer name not the vendor! not only was the phone i received different than the one i ordered but they also did not include a charging cable with the product. don't let them fool you, these phones are not new, and they are not being sold by samsung. do yourself a favor and just go to best buy instead.
my s7 edge lcd screen just died last month so i needed a phone right away. i am currently with verizon, so it sort of limits my phone choices. this phone works with verizon, it was cheaper than buying it directly from verizon, and i didn't have to pay an activation fee since i used my old sim card.in all honesty, i like the looks of the s7 edge better than this s9. i also miss having a physical button at the bottom of the phone.passive battery life on the s9 has been amazing so far. my old phone would be almost completely drained by the end of the day if i just checked it every once in a while. with the s9, i was periodically checking my phone once in a while, sending texts, etc., and i still had over 50% by midnight. some apps do kill the battery life pretty quickly, but the phone will notify you every once in a while when it notices you have apps running in the background.have not had time to play around with bixby yet.
my three stars has more to do with amazon's screw up than the phone itself.when you get your phone, check the model number !!!should be sm-g960u1.i ordered the us unlocked galaxy s9 (model number sm-g960u1), but amazon sent me a chinese unlocked phone (model number sm-g9600). although they look the same, the chinese phone only sort of works (dropped calls, poor sound quality, incoming calls go straight to voice mail), does not have a us warranty (all support comes out of china), and critical features your carrier offers will be disabled (such as t-mobile's wifi calling).it took me over a month to figure out why my wonderful galaxy s9 was a piece of crap. and neither amazon nor samsung were of much help in discovering the source of my problem. it wasn't until i tried to register my phone with samsung's u.s. website and failed that i got a clue.after much to do, amazon replaced my chinese phone with the correct one. like magic everything appears to be working fine including wifi calling.
i upgraded to the galaxy s9 from the galaxy s3. there are many improvements, however a lot was familiar. used it on the at&t network. it was easy getting a sim from them and replacing the s3 on my account.  one note:  at&t does not call the galaxy s9 by name on your account device page because you did not buy it from them.  they simply call it a ""device"".  this designation does not cause any issues with billing or anything else on your account. i asked support to change ""device"" to galaxy s9, but it never went through.  the camera itself has beautiful playback of all forms of media and has a great battery life. i'm not wild about the sidebar tabs to stow all your contacts and apps, i think they get in the way of other things you are doing.  summary: great phone.
awesome phone and love the fact that it's unlocked so no additional junk from your carrier if you would purchased it thru a carrier. i did have an issue about warranty but from the samsung care + side but was not disclosd when purchasing this phone. all in all amazon was willing to resolve the matter and gave me other options to purchase warranty. so overall love the phone and amazon customer service is top notch!!!!!
due to all the negative comments that previous people wrote regarding receiving boxes with no phones, or phones with scratches or previously used phones i was hesitant to make this purchase but happy to report the following:the samsung galaxy s9 unlocked (us version) 256gb coral blue phone arrived in brand new condition.  packaging was brand new with seals on packaging and phone also had factory protective clear films front and back. (gm960u1 model)  also packaged with the phone was the charger, all instructions, card tray key, and headphones.
has the typical oem bloatware as well as some google and third-party software that can't be removed. the hardware bixby button is an obvious attempt at overriding google assistant.  it's very easy to activate unintentionally.a samsung account is necessary to use their competing features; even some that don't make sense to need an account.the screen is brilliant and beautiful. the curved edges give it an attractive illusion of depth. battery life is very good and recharge is very fast.  samsung has the best swipe and predictive qwerty of all brands i've owned.i'm very happy with my purchase.
i purchased this amazon warehouse purchase because i could not bring myself to pay full price for todays high end smartphones.  after looking at the product i received it looks and functions as new.  i am deducting two stars because i tried to register the phone for warranty service to find that it couldn't be registered.  so i'm pulling one star for amazon listing it as having a us warranty, and one star from samsung for not being able to register the product.  i will continue to test the functionality of this phone in the coming week.  great value for the money if samsung supports the product as advertised.
received the phone. it worked fine for the first 6 weeks,then i lost battery power  i turned the phone off at night while charging, did not help. then every else started to fail. was sent to ""youbrakeifi ""  by samsung  tech support. diagnostic showed a flawed motherboard. i am leaving for overseas  next week. amazon  declined  refund,so i have no phone. this the only way i can communicate,  no other phone in house. i have to spend an other$700 today to buy a phone. will never ever purchase a phone from amazon. no support.
repackaged with sticky cellophane that left adhesive on back of phone and camera lenses that can't be removed. finger sensor appears dirty.  and nothing was in box except phone. no papers, no chargers, no headset. nothing.
i am a die hard apple person. all my desktop computers at home are apple, my other 4 family members all have iphones and we have laptops that are all apple. not really sure why i decided to try out the samsung galaxy s9+ but happy that i did so far. i was using a 4 1/2 year old iphone 5s so i figured any phone would be a huge upgrade to the modern world. it still takes a little getting used to coming from the ios system's way of doing things. i do lose the capability of imessage and facetime. not a huge deal and i can use the duo app from google which is the same as facetime. the key points with this phone are that the large and beautiful screen looks great. i like the haptic feel of the keys when texting how you feel the keys being pressed (a little buzz/vibration). i think the new iphone x does this too but again, i'm coming from a 5s. my only two choices for a new phone were this s9+ or keep on with apple and get an iphone x. the x would have cost me $1150 plus an applecare warranty for $200. i got this samsung (and got the ultimate play bundle) for $840 plus $100 for the bundle. took out a square trade 2 year warranty for $108 with only a $99 deductible should i need to use it. i have used square trade warranties in the past for other products and they have always replaced and stood by their guarantee. square trade is owned by allstate so i have confidence in them. getting back to the phone, the s9+ seems to work very fast when loading apps and pages. i use it for a lot of my wireless products at home (nest thermostat, wireless cameras, lifx lights, liftmaster garage door opener) and all work fast and flawlessly. the audio when playing music sounds great. plays very loud and clear for a phone. i like the fact that it does still have an earphone jack. i like the android system as it comes with google assistant voice command. most people hate the bixby feature on this phone. my only real gripe with it is the large button on the left side of the phone and that when trying to adjust the phone volume i accidentally hit bixby sometimes. i do like though that i's voice activated. i get in my car in the morning, speak to wake up bixby and command it to open up whatever app i need (usually waze). once open, i speak to waze to take me to work. all of this without having to look at my phones screen or take my eyes off the road. also, the bixby ai camera function is very cool too. there are about 8 or 9 different things it can do with the camera. like, point the camera lens at a sign in a foreign language and have it live translate the sign to english or any other language on the phone (and there are plenty of them on this phone). point it at food and it will tell you what it is and average calorie count. point it at a wine bottle label and it will give you the information on the wine (type, year, etc...). the only thing i think i will never use again and of course i tried it out is the animoji of myself or any of my friends. it's scary weird. everyone looks the same on this. i would personally like to see an update to the phone where they fix this to be more of a 3d type and look more realistic. i have been looking online for days at comparisons of the pictures taken on this phone compared to others. mot notably the iphone x. in my opinion, the x does do a lot of pix better. the contrast is usually better. the real advantage to this phone is it tends to overexpose a bit. so, dark scenes will look a bit brighter than on the iphone x. the only thing i had to get used to is the colors on a samsung phone are very oversaturated. colors are very bright. there is a setting in display function that gives you 4 options of view. i turned it down to one of them and it now looks a lot more realistic. i like the fact that this phone, as well as the iphone x, features ability to record video at 4k 60fps. looks great. on the samsung though the optical stabilization doesn't work when shooting 4k 60fps. keep a steady hand and this isn't an issue. for all other video formats, the stabilization on the samsung works better than the x. all in all, i am happy i went with the samsung. in a few months if i regret it, i can always keep it for a few months and sell it to get the new larger iphone x plus.update: 4/7/2018.  the voice unlock code is terrible. and, after searching through the options on the phone i came to the conclusion i don't need it. i have the face unlock or the fingerprint reader on the back. i actually go to the back fingerprint scan to unlock more than the other methods as it's just quick and easy to use. battery life has been good so far after using this phone for 3 weeks now. one thing i find annoying that i didn't know would be a problem is the video and picture quality when someone sends me a large video via texting. whether i send them a video or they send me one, it becomes such low quality that it's almost hard to see it at all. this is because of the compression the carriers use to send these video's or large picture files so it doesn't take up much space. i was used to having an iphone and using imessage. send any size video to someone else with an iphone and it was in great quality on both sides of the text. not so with android. now this is not just samsung but all android phones. so, for now, i have to send videos via whatsapp or viber (or a number of other text apps). they do compress but not horribly. oh, and one more note. i hope samsung corp is reading this review. the samsung customer service reps have to be the stupidest people i have ever dealt with for a tech company. i used to think comcast was bad until i called a couple of times and had to speak with someone at samsung. they just repeat my question and tell me they understand how i feel offering absolutely no answers. they put you on hold to find out but come back with no resolve. just terrible customer service. 180 degrees from dealing with someone at applecare when i had a question about my iphone or imac computer.2nd update: i didn't  realize this and this is very important to know before purchasing. in fact, i'm on the at&t network with my phone and the people in the factory store didn't know this. the sales people in best buy in the phone department did not know this either. when you buy an unlocked galaxy s9 or s9+, your phone is $840. if however you want to buy it thru at&t for their network and not a factory unlocked phone, it has different options on it. meaning, the unlocked phone will not have: wifi calling option, hd audio option, vvm (video voice messaging) and you will not get video voice calling. the option for these features is not even on my phone. now, you can buy the at&t phone and pay $915 up front or on a plan (either way it's $75 more than the factory unlocked phone). after you pay $75 ,more and if you are paying the full price up front, you can get the at&t phone unlocked and then you will have these features. nowhere at best buy or any at&t store do they tell you this. in my mind, it's a great misrepresentation that is omitted when purchasing. i picked up the bundle package here on amazon for $100 more and got a lot of cool gadgets so i'm keeping my setup. i just want others to know there is a difference when buying the unlocked version both in price and the feature set you get. i figured the at&t version just had a bunch of their proprietary apps pre-installed. hope this helps out someone beforehand that really wants those features. and, i went to the at&t store figuring there was a way they could flash the options to my phone. there isn't. they cannot update your phone to get these options.3rd update: april 15th, 2018i discovered a great feature today. i wish these galaxy 9 phones had the rise to wake feature which is what the iphone x has. you pick up the phone and just look at it to unlock via your face and it's good to go. what i discovered is setting the google assistant to open the galaxy even from the locked screen via my voice and the phone unlocks and does what you ask the google assistant to do. love this feature immensely.4th update april 23, 2018as i play around more with this phone, i am learning some cool things it can do. for instance, from the factory it come pre-set so that whether you swipe up or down the phone will go to your app tray. no need for repetition with swiping either up or down. there is a setting so that when you swipe up it opens the app tray (as it come from samsung pre-set) but change the setting and when you swipe down from any place on the phone and you've got your phones popular settings in front of you. even better, if you swipe down using two fingers from the top of the screen, it opens the second part of the settings which control other functions (usually this is a two part deal so this makes it one step easier). also, one thing samsung addressed with the 9 and 9+ (using the oreo software) is a problem people using these phones prior used to hate. now, you can set the up/down volume buttons to control media volume no matter what you are viewing. and, if you want to control the ringtone or another type of volume, when you push up or down on the volume and the media volume shows just tap on the down arrow on the top left of the screen and you have all the others ready to adjust exactly as you like them. apparently from reading online this has been an annoyance of a problem for a long time with the galaxy phones that is now solved.
the box i received didn't have a phone in it!!! instead, it had a cheap plastic phone case. also, the box had no seal on it so it could have been tampered with at any point. i watched ""unboxing"" videos for this phone, and there's supposed to be a sticker seal you have to break to open the box. from other reviews, it sounds like other customers have received empty boxes or dummy phones.customer service is processing a replacement. hopefully that goes alright. i'll update the review when i have more info on the replacement.
when the phone arrived excited to use  it then boom it does not work! it is an unlocked phone they say but it really isn't. their customer service stinks  and are no help. i want my money back!
mine stopped working after 45 days.. was working on it and all of a sudden it ga e colors and then black screen. so disappointing
great phone but a few problems and some thing you need to clear up and be more clear about when i got the phone it was not sealed and when i took it to get it actived i was told it was used other then that everything seems to be in the box and works just fine but you need to let ppl know these phones have been opened
metropcs initially had issues getting it added to my account, but i woke up the next morning and it was working fine. so, if anyone is wondering it does work on metropcs/t-mobile network! :) in the usa [i'm in st. louis, mo
bought this phone instead of buying directly from samsung. big mistake! just save yourself the trouble and buy from samsung directly!
i ordered the unlocked single-sim usa version of this phone (sm-g960u) which is compatible with all usa carriers. that same model number was stamped on the exterior label of the box. however, inside the box was the cheaper, dual-sim international phone (sm-g960f/ds) which won't work with verizon or sprint cdma bands.i ordered from amazon because the phone price was discounted $50, but this turned out to be a disappointing experience and waste of time. from now on i will buy my cell phones in person at an authorized distributor to make sure i get what i am paying for.
fake cloned phone. do not buy u'll be wasting your time and money. buy directly from samsung. please double check if you have a cloned phone or not. this is very deceptive
i bought 2 phones and 1 works perfectly but the other is trash. essential features dont work and its not worth the money.
the heart rate monitor not working , there is no rubber seal protecting the sim and micr sd card from water , poor display quality , poor camera , everything is just a big no. this is the first time i have ever experience this problem with amazon , and this is making me want to stop purchasing from amazon. i love amazon , but , if this is what they're doing to their loyal customers , i will not stand for it , but , i hope this was just a mistake that was made and not a scheme.
i switched to the s9 after i saw the price of the iphonex. i am not disappointed with switching to samsung, this phone has a much better display and camera than the iphones do. the pictures in the dark are phenomenal. it was easy to transfer all the data from my iphone because of the easy set up features. if your thinking about switching from the iphone, do it, you will not be disappointed.
pros: overall great phone-camera has high resolution and is ok for lower light photography due to dual apertures-great listening experience with dual speakers for stereo sound-one of the best displays on a smartphone, oled-wireless charging-a headphone jack-beautiful form factor with the display curving over the sidescon: possibly incompatible with cellular carrier (check model number)-for those not living in the uk, the listed model number is unlocked for the uk.the description does not explicitly list the compatible region for the listed model. i live in the us, but the model i received was sm-g960f/ds, which is an unlocked version with dual sim for the uk. this model is not compatible with verizon, sprint, and possibly other us cellular carriers.
was not given the actual phone. only a display model with no hardware, screen, camera, etc.
very nice upgrade from s7. i'm glad i went with the s9+ . i really like the big screen, and extra camera.
deffective and you get charged 15 per cent restocking fees and you pay for return shipping.not worth it
 after doing about a month of research for what i want a phone to do and how much battery life and other features inside a phone it beats all the other phones i've had out of the water.  granted i've only have phones 2013 or older this is like a night and day difference for my experience with phones.pros - sound quality out of the speakers is phenomal with highs not being too tiny and the bass not being too overbearing. - picture quality set to the max qwhd+ is a glorious thing - camera us stronger than a canon g7x that i recently purchased only downside being the zoom function makes it rather quick to get blurry.  - beautiful slo-mo option for video capture  - selfie camera is amazing as well with the filter options to clear up a face and also has a wide selfie option for large groups of people  - video recording is phenomenal with tracking and motion capturing - lightning fast loads on apps and web pages when my connection is strong. - fingerprint open on the back of phone conveniently placed - iris scanning - plenty of battery life for a full days use of gps tracking and music playing - samsung pay option for paying for items without needing to pull out a cardcons - camera zoom function isn't doing much good for picture quality but i understand it is in a small handheld device - price tag as always with flagship phones are rather high but paying it out right for me and flipping the phone for newer flag ships in the future doesn't make it all that expensive of a purchase when i go with a resale value in a couple years.all in all i do enjoy this phone and for me i found it this phone to be completely worth it as just through the experience i've had with the pictures and battery life alone.  it has yet to have any hiccups while using the phone and always does what i need it to do.only con that i have against it would be the price otherwise the phone is a complete stellar buy.
after opening the shipping box i found a wrong item inside. instead of a galaxy s9, there was a galaxy s9+ box sealed with shipping tape on both ends. i opened the box and found no phone inside, only some chains, yes chains, wrapped on a napkin, a samsung charger, a couple of generic chargers and some other small accessories.i reported the incident to amazon but they were unable to help me, unless a police report was filed.
i am so upset right now , just receive this box there is no phone inside this box  .
i was skeptical and afraid to buy after reading every single review. i however gave them the benefit of the doubt. it was the biggest mistake and i regret every damn second. i had this phone for literally 8 hours! 8 damn hours. for the first few hours the phone turned on the graphics on this phone looked amazing. i left for a store run to buy a phone case and screen protector. i was excited. i put on the screen protector and as i went to turn it on....nothing... black screen. i did everything. i tried to reset it, hard reset, plugged it in to its charger nothing. bunch of bull. just don't buy from them. don't even bother. i don't even know why this vendor is even still allowed to sell products. they needto be taken down. amazon needs to know how they are effing their customers over. just stay away.
this phone is supposed to be brand-new and unlocked. it looks brand-new, and so far, it is working fine, but the box was missing the sim ejecting needle and the beginners manual. i had the sim ejecting needle and i downloaded the users manual from samsung.com. after activating the phone with the tracfone carrier i got a message asking me to activate the phone with spring.  there is a way to go around that issue, and you do not get the message anymore as long as the phone stays on all the time, it is not a big deal. i contacted the seller through amazon, and he offered me a refund, but i do not want to return it because the phone is great. i would like the problem fixed.
good phone, but do not fall prey to the samsung trade in program. its impossible to find how to do the trade in and it has multiple stipulations.
exactly as advertised. brand new us unlocked model of the galaxy s9 (sm-g960u1). works perfectly with all the sums i've tried (at&t &verizon) get better service with verizon in my area. being the unlocked model it isn't full of carrier bloatware so if you don't have a use for those many of them can just be downloaded. completely satisfied.also believe this phone pick up different waves than the s8 i used to get 3 bars consistently in my area with the s8 and i've had 4 with this one since i set it up.
i was nervous about purchasing an unlocked phone from amazon, not knowing what i'd get. but i purchased this, sold and fulfilled by amazon, and have been very pleased with my s9.  i had to purchase a separate sim card from my carrier, t-mobile,  but that is true with any unlocked phone you buy.  this doesn't come with a wall or car charger but that is true for all s9's so you have to purchase these separately.  i've had earlier versions of samsung phones and this is the best phone i've had in terms of screen clarity, memory speed, photo quality, audio and much more.  if you are considering buying this phone, your best best is to buy directly from amazon as a seller, not a third party seller.  otherwise, be sure to read the third party's terms carefully and be aware buying from a third party seller comes with risks.
this phone is absolutely fabulous!!  i switched from a moto x pure~ which i loved ~ so this is a huge upgrade.  it was so so easy to set up ~ there is an adapter included that you attach to your old phone and use an app to copy all of your files.  awesome.  it is super fast and i love how customizable it is,  from themes to icons to fonts.  i haven't had any issues with bixby.  sound is awesome  and sound is a very important aspect to me.  the display is beautiful and camera is fabulous.  i am so concerned about breakage ~ i have ms and tend to twitch a lot and i drop things.  so i researched forever for a protective but pretty case and i hope i found it.  i also have a screen protector and a pop socket.  and i love the whole set up.  it now feels really secure in my hand.  the case did add a bit of weight but i don't mind.  i also worried about getting a fake phone or an empty box~ i purchased an unlocked phone and worried about that l.  research your seller ~ i even emailed them and told them my concerns before i purchased mine.  i ended up getting mine from endlessitems17 and highly recommend them.  amazon didn't update the seller's stock before i already bought it.  they contacted me the same day,  offered me a black one, or a refund, or wait till they got one in.  i chose to wait rather than a refund cuz who knows how long that would take!  they weren't supposed to get any in for three days and that was monday.  customer service was awesome ~ said that they would try to find one quicker~ and i recieved my phone yesterday ~ wednesday!  it came in perfect condition,  and was a breeze for metro to get it up and running.  i am totally happy with this phone and recommend buying it!
this phone is leagues better than my s6 was, mostly due to refinement of the phone rather than innovation. it does everything you want it to, has a great camera, beautiful screen, and everything you've come to expect from a samsung flagship.that said, it's not a massive improvement from the s8. it's more polished, but it is essentially the same phone.if your got a need to upgrade to a new device from a 3+ year old device, absolutely worth the investment. from a more modern phone, not so much.
this, most definitely is the best smartphone you can get today. it's so beautiful. i fall in love with it every single day. add the wireless charger, ear buds, and watch, and you've got yourself an amazing smartphone experience.you do need to get a cover for the glass back though, because it's not as strong as it is proposed to be. get the alcantara case from samsung. also, stick with apps from the play store, and themes from samsung ™, you'll have a hitch free, glitch free ride..
it's clear now that mine arrived defective. a problem started as intermittent and got worse: people couldn't hear me on speakerphone, and sometimes in handset mode too. i had a long call with tech support 3 months in, which ended in my hard-resetting the phone. the problem seemed to go away but didn't really. then i dropped the phone getting a functional, and barely visible crack. i eventually confronted the problem again, calling tech support. i mentioned the crack and they said this would not impede repair under warranty. as instructed, i brought it to ufixibreak, where i was told that a) the drop voided the warranty for all parts b) they would replace the broken part without also doing the screen even though i didn't need it done. so the cost for me was not zero but $340.when my korean car gets rear-ended, does that automatically void all the warranty on all the engine parts?i am livid and definitely won't buy a samsung again.
i read all the reviews and decided to go with the amazon shipped version of this phone to have the amazon guarantee.  a lot of reviews said this phone would not work on verizon, and that voicemail and wireless calling was not going to work.  well, all of these comments were obviously from people who didn't investigate it thoroughly.  my wireless calling works fine, my voicemail works fine and the phone works on verizon.  here is what i discovered that you will need to do if you purchase this phone if you putting it on verizon.  be sure to register an account with samsung galaxy store right on the phone and update all of your apps and when you do, it will give you samsung essentials and visual voicemail that is just like verizon's only with a blue icon instead of red.  works the same.  if you go into the settings, and turn on wireless calling, it might take a couple of tries, but it does come on, and it does work as i live in a completely shielded home where verizon's signal does not penetrate my walls or roof and my phone works perfectly over wireless.  as far as getting connected to verizon goes, all you have to do is take your sim card from your old phone and put it in the new phone.  if you have to get a new sim card from verizon because of size difference, have verizon register a new sim to your old phone, then you put it into the new phone.  these phones are approved on verizon's list of phones, but their system does not recognize the imei number and says it is not compatible and won't let the stores customer service reps scan the phone into their system.  you have to put your old sim into the new phone and then it works perfectly.  i called 611 while i was in the store and they told me how to get around their system not recognizing the imei numbers as valid.the unlocked s9+ is the best phone i have ever had..... totally happy with my purchase.
i like the phone but this one died. the other 2 are working great.  the exchange is slow especially when you need your phone. still haven't got the replacement.
i bought two of these for the kids. we went to a sprint store to get them activated and switched over from the old phones. both needed a sim card installed, only 5 bucks each so no big deal there. these s9's were upgrades from our s6 and note5 which did not use sim cards.they have both been in use for a few weeks now and i have not heard any complaints.  they look nice and the battery seems to last all day if fully charged.buying them on amazon means no re-upping my sprint contract, which is good because i prefer to minimize my commitments to any contract.
i've been wanting a samsung s series phone since the s4. i finally bit the bullet and bought the factory unlocked s9 and i couldn't be happier with a phone! there are very minor, minor things about it that are hardly worth mentioning that bug me, such as not having an emoji search function (see? not even worth mentioning), but omg i'm in love with this thing.  i'm officially a convert.  it's worth every penny.  make sure its factory unlocked! otherwise you won't be able to update the os.phone came beautifully packaged brand new with charger and headphones.
this is my first time buying an unlocked phone online and i feel like i got more than i bargained for. the super amoled screen is hands down one of the best i have seen on a smartphone and i am enjoying it very much. same goes for the speakers.in addition to that, i got to ""pixelize"" my phone, download tons of apps, files and i have to say i have not suffered from the infamous samsung lag, but if it does slow down at one point, samsung does have a function to test, diagnose and optimize your phone so i plan on taking advantage of that in the future.i'm also very satisfied with the battery. i'm a heavy user and so far it has been lasting me for a full day whereas my previous phone needed to be charged twice per day.as for the camera, i have yet to fully test what it's capable of, but i've taken a few low light pictures and have been quite impressed by how nice they looked.all in all this is a great phone and definitely a worthy purchase.
this phone was not compatible with sprint network. we spent half our day at 2 different sprint stores in an attempt to activate this phone. i also purchased a otterbox case and screen protector which i am losing $15 on becuase seller is charging me for the return.
several reviews said this unlocked phone would be fine with boost mobile.  took it into a boost store and the lady behind the counter was really nice and she tried and tried and could not get it to work with boost.  even though boost sells this exact same phone.... hmm...  nice gimmick, boost.  she did say the phone was sprint compatible.  boost is owned by sprint and its phones will run on the sprint network.  so, what gives boost?
phone beeps and shuts down broken phone
excellent smartphone for the busy professional as well as for those moments when you just need to relax and unwind. a super fast processor and an awesome camera that is above average. i especially like the speed with which the intellegent scanner and fingerprint scanner both work to unlock the screen. this comes in handy in situations where you need a quick peek at messages or other info on the notification panel. the best smartphone that samsung has ever produced and definitely the best smartphone for 2018.
hi good day i purchased this phone an it giving problems its getting hot the apps are taking long to open it is constantly freezing
i was concerned about ordering the unlocked s9 after reading several mixed reviews on whether or not this was compatible with verizon and some people saying they recieved refurbished or defective phones.  after more research and a nice sale price i took a bit of a chance and pulled the trigger.  glad i did.  received the phone in perfectly new condition and no issues on verizon network at all.  i just popped in my sim and it's worked perfectly since.  coming from an s8, the s9 is almost identical....with some notable improvements.  but i'm not going to turn this into an s9 product review.  if you're looking here for an unlocked phone to purchase, you already know if you like the s9 or not.  anyway, i got a good quality, new phone at a much better price than i could have got direct from v, bb, or most other stores (unless you want to lock yourself in with a carrier for two years).
i retrurned the device(galaxy s9+) that i got from this seller(relliant celular) because it was not new and it was not unlocked like the seller claims on the selling page (did not work with verizon). i spent some more money and bought it eventualy at best buy and it works great and its also new so make your decisions... this called misleading the customer
the phone is fast, with a solid build.  but the signal reception is horrible.  at my home the signal is always weak, but my motorola g5 plus had much better reception.  the range for cell service is -50 to -120.  closer to -50 is better, but this s9 is -118 in a weak area, but still -113 in a good area!  if you don't need a 3.5mm headphone jack, then get the z3 play.  it's far better as a phone, and motorola really knows what they're doing with convenience.  i loved my g5+, but i loved my samsung s3, s4 and s5 too.  but this s9 is pretty poor.
i have just received it, and it’s great that there’s an option to transfer data onto it from other phones, including my iphone se. other reviews claimed that there was no phone in the box, or accessories were missing. this made me a bit skeptical and worried, but i’m glad i took the gamble. a beautiful phone, and the infinity screen makes it more beautiful. fingerprint scanner is an a very efficient place and takes less than 3 seconds to set up. i will be back with another review in a month or so.
lovin' this phone! clobbered the front of its s9 predecessor, so i ordered this phone and simply switched sim cards ... bingo, connected to the at&t network without a hitch. these phones are so smart - it downloaded/uploaded all the prior info from the dead phone. buy with confidence. thanks, amazon for offering ""unlocked"" phones!
very happy with my purchase. i was a little skeptical ordering it online, but decided to give it a go. phone came within a couple days of ordering. packaging was very good, and phone was in mint condition. photo quality is awesome! this was one of my main reasons for purchasing this phone. i previously owned a samsung s7. some features have changed on the phone, for example the home button is no longer there, and has the bixby feature which i am trying to figure out. overall would highly recommend!
i read some disturbing reviews on here for this phone, but they seemed to be more for the sellers than the actual phone. i got my blue s9+ direct from amazon and it was brand new & perfectly intact. it was insanely easy to transfer all of the info from my old phone and to have my service switched to the new phone. it's beautiful and a nice upgrade from my lg v20. the best part is that i bought it here for about $300 less than i would have with my carrier. excellent buy, very happy!
i've been an iphone user for 12 years and this is my first samsung so it's taking a little getting used to.  ive been spoiled by having a phone that flawlessly synced with my mac.  however i'm digging the extended battery life, the camera clarity, the screens resolution adjustability, the expandable memory  and things like that which have made the switch pleasant.  the only reason i'm not giving it 5 stars is the price and the lack of usb audio play through car audio systems.  even with black friday pricing the s9 isn't really competitive in the price department.  for unknown reasons samsung did away with the simple plug and play usb audio.  there is a mirror link app on the phone for using usb audio only a few cars have that capability.
so different from previous models. removed many of the options i need and loved.  sad.i needed more internal memory. almost left galaxy after many years due to curved infinity screen and silly edge. bixby is useless.i was advised by many techs not to purchase this model.  i finally decided based on slo mo, avitar & more memory.iphones are more sturdy & have better batteries but no micro sd card!when galaxy removes sd card i'll leave them for iphone as i can no longer replace batteries in galaxy. why galaxy? praying battery lasts.very complex phone with long learning curve. too many options! hate curved infinity screen, bixby & edge. useless waste!64 gb memory is great so far. once you buy alexa you need so much more internal memory.not sure how long battery will last. crossing my fingers since it can't be replaced.why on earth did they use curved infinity screen? very hard to find case and screen protectors that work.  phone is so fragile.what is value and purpose  of ""bixby""? also find ""edge""useless and unnecessary.great stereo sound on movies.still learning phone hidden tricks after many weeks! learning curve takes forever.will test with camera soon and get back to you. i loved the s4 and s5 cameras. why less mp now on this model?
after 3 months with this phone, i can conclude that this is a very solid android phone. jam-packed with features like stereo speakers, led indicator, wireless charging, face unlock/iris scanner, fast fingerprint sensor with gesture controls, headphone jack (obviously), 1440p super oled display and plenty of others features. the cameras, while nowhere near the level of the google pixel 3, are still very strong on their own, producing quality photos, steady video, and surprisingly good portrait mode. only downsides are that the battery drains a little faster expected, a dedicated bixby button which can be really annoying if you press on accident, samsung bloatware, and a very tacky ar emoji. coming from an lifelong iphone user, i can confidently say that anyone who isn’t too attached to the apple ecosystem will have an amazing experience. this is my first android phone, and can say with confidence that samsung successfully made me satisfied with my purchase.
arguably the best smartphone that i've ever purchased.  works great and plenty of great features.  great camera.i had no real problems switching the sim card from my old phone to the s9+.so why did i give it only 4 stars?  well, i find bixby of little value for me and i accidentally press its button at times.  also that facebook is permanently installed (can be ""disabled"").  however according to my router of my wifi network, there is communications to and from facebook (unknown which source/app on the phone is the cause).
i'm not sure if it was just the phone or if the s9 actually isn't as good as i thought it would be.. i'm thinking it was the phone because i upgraded to the s9 plus and am now absolutely in love with it. i did order this one 1st though and had a lot of trouble with the voice to text. actually texting was really hard in general too. that made it kind of a bummer to play around on because i use voice command a lot. i decided to return it and just got my refund.. i am so thankful i was able to get that at least!! that's the only reason i rated at 3 stars instead of only two.
phone takes good pictures, too bad it just doesnt want to charge.  amazon wants to charge me 8 dollars to refund this garbage, and the garbage insurance i purchased wants 90 dollars to replace their shoddy product.im broke at the moment, and i am currently missing out on a phone interview for a second job because it wont charge. i missed going to the bank because what should have taken 3 seconds to replace a shoddy product sold by one of the wealthiest companies in the world turned into taking an entire afternoon and evening to fixstay away from this garbage phone and company amazon when buying phones, this is the second phone in a row.  amazon is a scam.
i purchased this phone some months ago and was extremely excited to try it out. it arrived perfectly with all the parts and pieces it was supposed to come with and for the first two months i was completely satisfied with my purchase. i'd also took measures and purchased a heavy duty phone case and a screen protector to make sure this puppy lasted me a while. however, two months in, my phone started unexpectedly freezing and the battery life was starting to decline rapidly. i had only used 18 of the 64 gb available but i took the time to clean out my storage and any unnecessary files anyways in hopes that the phone's behavior would improve. to my surprise, its performance was rapidly declining more and more by the days. not long after it got to the point where my phone screen would randomly turn itself off and not turn back on. the phone would vibrate like it would when it was on when i'd press the home button but the screen would not light up. it would do this multiple times a day and i would have to manually soft reset it every single time. i reached out to samsung support and was not able to receive any help or answers from them. by this point my 30-day warranty had already expired and amazon would no longer be able to exchange the phone for me. i wish i had just spent a few dollars extra to make sure that i had received a reliable phone. very unsatisfied
just ordered this device to replace an older s7 edge whose battery expanded on me and took the back of the phone out with it as it expanded - that phone was only three years old but well beyond its warranty.i hope the battery on the s9 won't go the way the s7 did.enabling the s9 on the verizon network only involved swapping the sim card between devices.  it confused me a bit because it was my understanding i would have to register the devices exchange on the verizon website.  it happened automatically after installing the old sim card in the new phone.the device came with android oreo from february 2018 installed - needed a couple of patch updates.  it also came charged 96%.the s9 has a smaller screen, it's a bit lighter and much more responsive  than the s7 edge.  it could also be that it's new so android isn't as bloated, although it has all my data and apps moved over.  transferring data and settings was a snap - used the samsung utility and usb cable adapter to do this.good experience so far to get going, if something happens, i'll be back here to amend this review.  excellent experience so far with both the phone and amazon's handling of it.
a really good phone, neat features.the speaker is not working after about two weeks.
took the phone to the verizon store and was told that it was incompatible with their network. don't waste your time with this if you have verizon.
the battery life was shorter than a new phone. the phone itself was fine but the description was misleading as #1 the ""us warranty"" stated in the title is void when reselling a used phone. it also states, ""accessories may have cosmetic damage"" this was false as well because the original items were completely replaced by generic headphones and power cord. you will not receive what was promised unless you buy a new phone, which i had to do. i had to return this item, and am still waiting for my refund.
i bought this phone because it could be used with cdma and sim cards both.  i had planned on using verizon at home and wanted to be able to purchase sim cards to use in the phone when i travel internationally.  but this phone appears to be an at&t phone that is ""unlocked"" so that it can also be used on t-mobile and presumably, other sim cards.  i have wasted a week's time, tried a couple of different sim cards from a couple of different carriers, purchased a new sim card, and am just done with this.  do not believe the q&a section where it says the phone can be used with all 4 carriers.  it absolutely cannot.  i will be returning this.
i upgraded from the samsung s8 to the samsung s9+.  i'm happy i decided to get the plus edition of the s9 as it offers a lot of extra features for the value in addition to higher quality components and screen size and resolution. i got the 64gb because the 128gb was out of stock.  but there's an expandable memory bay in the s9+ which allows you to add up to 1tb of storage.rating: 15/10
i upgraded from an s6 so i'm pretty familiar with the s9 plus although there are changes. loved my s6 and love the s9 plus although i don't like the larger size. the only issue with this order was that i received a black s9 plus, not coral blue. not a big deal since it'll be in a case but if you have your heart set on a particular color, make sure that's what they're sending you.
arrived earlier than expected, everything was included in the box, works 100%, everything thing it was said and expected to be. this phone is worth buying.
the galaxy s9 was a replacement for an older generation galaxy that could no longer hold all of the apps i use.  my smartphone use consists primarily of voice, text, search, and gps guidance functions and an occasional photograph.  it also functions as an always available stand in for my kindle. for me, the galaxy s9 is the perfect combination of size, function, reliability and battery life.  i've wrapped it in an otterbox commuter case coupled with a magglass screen protector to help protect it against the inevitable drops and impacts it will experience over time.  it's menu system is simple and relatively intuitive although i'm sure i've missed some of its advanced functions since i haven't taken the time to download or read the full user manual. overall, i couldn't be happier with the phone.
so far so good, phone isn't a clone as far as i can tell, so that's good. came in pretty good condition, however the sim tool was loose and there are a few scratches near the top of the phone. there is also some weird white stuff on the ear piece that doesn't seem to wanna come off so i question if it's really a brand new phone. my only other issue is that for a full price phone, you would think all the accessories would be real. the headphones that come with it are a cheap vietnam knock off of the akg headphones and don't even have the akg logo on them, and they sound very muffled, and feel really cheap. the adapter for the phone charger is real, however the charging cable isn't the original samsung charging cable at all, barely even fits into the adapter (sticks out a bit). and there is no samsung seal of approval in the box, so i can only assume someone opened it, took out what they wanted and replaced it with cheap knock offs of what should be in there, and forgot to put the seal back. if i didn't need this phone so bad i would send it back and request an entirely brand new device that is completely sealed and never been opened. but my old phone is a vegetable so i can't go back to it. lastly on the possibility of a clone, the pictures that it takes look very....odd, like the quality is very low rez, again making me question if this is a ""really good"" clone. i don't recommend going through this seller by any means. 👎👎
i have been watching my ""non-apple"" friends for some time now... wondering, watching.  i bought a motoroloa cheapo phone just to check out the os.  how did i like the google options, the easiness of the apps, user interface?  loved it.so, i started to search for the ""real deal""  and i have been very impressed with the galaxy s9+.  the screen is unbelievably crisp.  camera?  crazy good!very happy with this phone, even happier it is unlocked so i can test the waters with different providers too.:)
i bought this phone thinking that it would be better than my current s6 edge - and just about in every way it is specially low light shots, but disappointed with the picture ai results in general.  i normally use my phone as a camera, less so as a computer or streaming device.sure wide shots look indiscernible, but once you want to see some details the s9+ images become murky at 100% zoom as the auto settings normally changes to f1.5 (no you cannot force it to use f2.4 in auto mode - which most users use)  fonts looks blotchy upon closer inspection.  yes i understand you can set it to pro mode so you can do this, but most times i use my phone to take pictures within 3 secs, no time for fiddling with settings.the s6 has a 16m native resolution at 4x3, so setting it to 16x9 reduces resolution to 12m.the 9+ has a 12m native resolution at 4x3, so setting it to 16x9 reduces resolution to 9m.quite possible this may be causing it, but i read the pixel has the same resolution but takes better photos because of the ai implementation.i normally shoot at 16x9 size settings so it fills my monitor screen and fb uploads, and this is how i compared the shots.aside from the uploaded picture, i have also compared outside scenes on both phones - and i do notice slightly murkier pictures with the s9+.in the dlsr world, sometimes you get bad lens so the logical thing is to replace the lens for a sharper one, but not everyone has this luxury with a phone specially if you are at a mobile carrier store with strict use limits.  i did a little research and found forums where people complain of the image quality as well, so i don't think i'm in the minority.
first let me say that the galaxy s9+ is a big beautiful phone. the screen is outstanding, the speed is fast and it has more features than i ever probably learn to use. definitely a first-class phone from samsung.what i really want to say is: i purchased this galaxy s9+ from the amazon warehouse at great price with an additional 20% discount. i was concerned about purchasing a used-like new phone but my son, who had previously worked at amazon, said those phones were in new condition and a great buy. he was right.the phone was without a scratch and had a clean esn. it came in the original box ( a little beat up) with all the original accessories still wrapped up. activation was no problem and it is working great. and it was half the price of a new phone! half price for a galaxy s9+! i am so happy and will recommend to my friends who are shopping for new phones to check out the amazon warehouse deals.update: i am taking off one star because i cannot get insurance on phone. amazon will not provide nor even offer insurance on own product. there are two insurance providers on amazon, squaretrade and asurion, but neither will cover used amazon phone. interestingly, the both cover used eb*y phones but amazon can't or won't get them to cover their used products. go figure???
terrible es casi un robo de 800$ no dan soluciones inmediatas , entregan los paquetes al que este no a la persona a cual va como destinatario, que seguridad dan al comprar , me han robado 800 dolares por este celular que dicen dar una explicación en 72 horas , sin asegurar que devuelvan el dinero , cuando nunca recibí el paquete nunca, tengan cuidado con estas compras por aquí.
now this phone would be the ideal phone for a younger person or ppl with small fingers and can see will. since i’m either the reason for the stars. i went from a iphone 6 plus to this and have wanted to busted it up every since. it’s not the phones fault. it’s mine because i can’t see it well and my fingers are to big to text correctly. i’m always hitting button i didn’t mean to and have to erase and retype most of my text. maybe should have went with the plus size. the volume is a little low for my hearing and i didn’t think my hearing was bad. i find sometimes i have to hold it up to my ear to hear somethings. i don’t know if it me or the phone. the battery life i have to charge it every night. i am not a person to stay on my phone all day. just general text,facebook and maybe play a game for a bit. there maybe things i can turn off to extend the battery which i have turned to youtube for some advise but i still didn’t find anything to help extend the battery. overall, after being so excited with getting a chance to have one of these phones i am disappointed with it. i’m 41 years old so i’m not over the hill. i wish i could go back and buy the plus version. so on this one be your on judge.
bodyi am very disappointed with this mobile phone.first of all, in the united states even the network signal is so bad that a lot of software can not be used.second, cell phone battery life is very shortthe first few days of receipt can only last one day.it is not a month, full of electricity can only be used during the day.disappointing.
received the phone. it worked fine for the first 6 weeks,then i lost battery power  i turned the phone off at night while charging, did not help. then every else started to fail. was sent to ""youbrakeifi ""  by samsung  tech support. diagnostic showed a flawed motherboard. i am leaving for overseas  next week. amazon  declined  refund,so i have no phone. this the only way i can communicate,  no other phone in house. i have to spend an other$700 today to buy a phone. will never ever purchase a phone from amazon. no support.
repackaged with sticky cellophane that left adhesive on back of phone and camera lenses that can't be removed. finger sensor appears dirty.  and nothing was in box except phone. no papers, no chargers, no headset. nothing.
i am a die hard apple person. all my desktop computers at home are apple, my other 4 family members all have iphones and we have laptops that are all apple. not really sure why i decided to try out the samsung galaxy s9+ but happy that i did so far. i was using a 4 1/2 year old iphone 5s so i figured any phone would be a huge upgrade to the modern world. it still takes a little getting used to coming from the ios system's way of doing things. i do lose the capability of imessage and facetime. not a huge deal and i can use the duo app from google which is the same as facetime. the key points with this phone are that the large and beautiful screen looks great. i like the haptic feel of the keys when texting how you feel the keys being pressed (a little buzz/vibration). i think the new iphone x does this too but again, i'm coming from a 5s. my only two choices for a new phone were this s9+ or keep on with apple and get an iphone x. the x would have cost me $1150 plus an applecare warranty for $200. i got this samsung (and got the ultimate play bundle) for $840 plus $100 for the bundle. took out a square trade 2 year warranty for $108 with only a $99 deductible should i need to use it. i have used square trade warranties in the past for other products and they have always replaced and stood by their guarantee. square trade is owned by allstate so i have confidence in them. getting back to the phone, the s9+ seems to work very fast when loading apps and pages. i use it for a lot of my wireless products at home (nest thermostat, wireless cameras, lifx lights, liftmaster garage door opener) and all work fast and flawlessly. the audio when playing music sounds great. plays very loud and clear for a phone. i like the fact that it does still have an earphone jack. i like the android system as it comes with google assistant voice command. most people hate the bixby feature on this phone. my only real gripe with it is the large button on the left side of the phone and that when trying to adjust the phone volume i accidentally hit bixby sometimes. i do like though that i's voice activated. i get in my car in the morning, speak to wake up bixby and command it to open up whatever app i need (usually waze). once open, i speak to waze to take me to work. all of this without having to look at my phones screen or take my eyes off the road. also, the bixby ai camera function is very cool too. there are about 8 or 9 different things it can do with the camera. like, point the camera lens at a sign in a foreign language and have it live translate the sign to english or any other language on the phone (and there are plenty of them on this phone). point it at food and it will tell you what it is and average calorie count. point it at a wine bottle label and it will give you the information on the wine (type, year, etc...). the only thing i think i will never use again and of course i tried it out is the animoji of myself or any of my friends. it's scary weird. everyone looks the same on this. i would personally like to see an update to the phone where they fix this to be more of a 3d type and look more realistic. i have been looking online for days at comparisons of the pictures taken on this phone compared to others. mot notably the iphone x. in my opinion, the x does do a lot of pix better. the contrast is usually better. the real advantage to this phone is it tends to overexpose a bit. so, dark scenes will look a bit brighter than on the iphone x. the only thing i had to get used to is the colors on a samsung phone are very oversaturated. colors are very bright. there is a setting in display function that gives you 4 options of view. i turned it down to one of them and it now looks a lot more realistic. i like the fact that this phone, as well as the iphone x, features ability to record video at 4k 60fps. looks great. on the samsung though the optical stabilization doesn't work when shooting 4k 60fps. keep a steady hand and this isn't an issue. for all other video formats, the stabilization on the samsung works better than the x. all in all, i am happy i went with the samsung. in a few months if i regret it, i can always keep it for a few months and sell it to get the new larger iphone x plus.update: 4/7/2018.  the voice unlock code is terrible. and, after searching through the options on the phone i came to the conclusion i don't need it. i have the face unlock or the fingerprint reader on the back. i actually go to the back fingerprint scan to unlock more than the other methods as it's just quick and easy to use. battery life has been good so far after using this phone for 3 weeks now. one thing i find annoying that i didn't know would be a problem is the video and picture quality when someone sends me a large video via texting. whether i send them a video or they send me one, it becomes such low quality that it's almost hard to see it at all. this is because of the compression the carriers use to send these video's or large picture files so it doesn't take up much space. i was used to having an iphone and using imessage. send any size video to someone else with an iphone and it was in great quality on both sides of the text. not so with android. now this is not just samsung but all android phones. so, for now, i have to send videos via whatsapp or viber (or a number of other text apps). they do compress but not horribly. oh, and one more note. i hope samsung corp is reading this review. the samsung customer service reps have to be the stupidest people i have ever dealt with for a tech company. i used to think comcast was bad until i called a couple of times and had to speak with someone at samsung. they just repeat my question and tell me they understand how i feel offering absolutely no answers. they put you on hold to find out but come back with no resolve. just terrible customer service. 180 degrees from dealing with someone at applecare when i had a question about my iphone or imac computer.2nd update: i didn't  realize this and this is very important to know before purchasing. in fact, i'm on the at&t network with my phone and the people in the factory store didn't know this. the sales people in best buy in the phone department did not know this either. when you buy an unlocked galaxy s9 or s9+, your phone is $840. if however you want to buy it thru at&t for their network and not a factory unlocked phone, it has different options on it. meaning, the unlocked phone will not have: wifi calling option, hd audio option, vvm (video voice messaging) and you will not get video voice calling. the option for these features is not even on my phone. now, you can buy the at&t phone and pay $915 up front or on a plan (either way it's $75 more than the factory unlocked phone). after you pay $75 ,more and if you are paying the full price up front, you can get the at&t phone unlocked and then you will have these features. nowhere at best buy or any at&t store do they tell you this. in my mind, it's a great misrepresentation that is omitted when purchasing. i picked up the bundle package here on amazon for $100 more and got a lot of cool gadgets so i'm keeping my setup. i just want others to know there is a difference when buying the unlocked version both in price and the feature set you get. i figured the at&t version just had a bunch of their proprietary apps pre-installed. hope this helps out someone beforehand that really wants those features. and, i went to the at&t store figuring there was a way they could flash the options to my phone. there isn't. they cannot update your phone to get these options.3rd update: april 15th, 2018i discovered a great feature today. i wish these galaxy 9 phones had the rise to wake feature which is what the iphone x has. you pick up the phone and just look at it to unlock via your face and it's good to go. what i discovered is setting the google assistant to open the galaxy even from the locked screen via my voice and the phone unlocks and does what you ask the google assistant to do. love this feature immensely.4th update april 23, 2018as i play around more with this phone, i am learning some cool things it can do. for instance, from the factory it come pre-set so that whether you swipe up or down the phone will go to your app tray. no need for repetition with swiping either up or down. there is a setting so that when you swipe up it opens the app tray (as it come from samsung pre-set) but change the setting and when you swipe down from any place on the phone and you've got your phones popular settings in front of you. even better, if you swipe down using two fingers from the top of the screen, it opens the second part of the settings which control other functions (usually this is a two part deal so this makes it one step easier). also, one thing samsung addressed with the 9 and 9+ (using the oreo software) is a problem people using these phones prior used to hate. now, you can set the up/down volume buttons to control media volume no matter what you are viewing. and, if you want to control the ringtone or another type of volume, when you push up or down on the volume and the media volume shows just tap on the down arrow on the top left of the screen and you have all the others ready to adjust exactly as you like them. apparently from reading online this has been an annoyance of a problem for a long time with the galaxy phones that is now solved.
the box i received didn't have a phone in it!!! instead, it had a cheap plastic phone case. also, the box had no seal on it so it could have been tampered with at any point. i watched ""unboxing"" videos for this phone, and there's supposed to be a sticker seal you have to break to open the box. from other reviews, it sounds like other customers have received empty boxes or dummy phones.customer service is processing a replacement. hopefully that goes alright. i'll update the review when i have more info on the replacement.
when the phone arrived excited to use  it then boom it does not work! it is an unlocked phone they say but it really isn't. their customer service stinks  and are no help. i want my money back!
mine stopped working after 45 days.. was working on it and all of a sudden it ga e colors and then black screen. so disappointing
great phone but a few problems and some thing you need to clear up and be more clear about when i got the phone it was not sealed and when i took it to get it actived i was told it was used other then that everything seems to be in the box and works just fine but you need to let ppl know these phones have been opened
metropcs initially had issues getting it added to my account, but i woke up the next morning and it was working fine. so, if anyone is wondering it does work on metropcs/t-mobile network! :) in the usa [i'm in st. louis, mo
bought this phone instead of buying directly from samsung. big mistake! just save yourself the trouble and buy from samsung directly!
i ordered the unlocked single-sim usa version of this phone (sm-g960u) which is compatible with all usa carriers. that same model number was stamped on the exterior label of the box. however, inside the box was the cheaper, dual-sim international phone (sm-g960f/ds) which won't work with verizon or sprint cdma bands.i ordered from amazon because the phone price was discounted $50, but this turned out to be a disappointing experience and waste of time. from now on i will buy my cell phones in person at an authorized distributor to make sure i get what i am paying for.
bought this phone to replace an iphone 7. wife likes the phone but coming from the simplicity of the ios, this is a little more complicated. she has since gotten used to it but still struggles with advance settings.the reason for the 3 stars is it is an unlocked phones and unlocked phones do not get updates quickly. the so o. carrier locked phones have already upgraded to the pie and one ui updates but no word on when the unlocked phones will get theirs. samsung need to step up their customer service game.
purely impressed!  an amazing piece of hardware from samsung which - to me - excels in all things hardware related, and this is no exception.  there is not a single element of the hardware (screen, battery, size, ports, camera, hardware specifications, resilience, and so forth) that isn't outstanding on paper or in action.  the added customization, openness,  and versatility of the android os is welcomed compared to apple's ios.the added versatility of the unlocked version is nice if a carrier switch or something of that sort is possible, but may inhibit certain carrier exclusive features depending on the carrier (like digital voicemail).my only minor complaint is of all the samsung apps, software, and features (bloatware?) that is crammed into the phone and semi-forces its use.  a lot it seems like more of sales pitch rather than adding any value.  *cough*  the ""bixby button""...  *cough*  i feel this is samsung's weak-point with its mobile offerings at the moment.as an aside, this is my first android phone, after having all iphones.  i decided to switch to the galaxy s9 and android os after not liking the direction apple was going with its flagship phones. plus, the cutting edge features combined with sensible design choices, such as a headphone jack and touch recognition, compelled me to ""switch-sides"".  6+ months later, at the time of this review, i'm still completely satisfied with my galaxy s9.
it claimed to be unlocked in the title but when i received it, it only accepted verizon wireless
received the phone, was tricky to turn on with sprint, finally got it turned on, after about 6 weeks i got a black screen and the phone wouldn't power on or work in any way. amazon / samsung sent a replacement, got the replacement and its been a nightmare to turn on with sprint, in the end sprint couldn't do it, this has been a nightmare and its taken up so much of my time and energy, its stressed me out to no end. i will be canceling my amazon prime and i am done with amazon. the entire procedure for returns have been a joke and nobody was any help, also sprint & samsung have been horrible, avoid that one aswell. the phone claims to be unlocked, it is not. samsung and amazon were no help what so ever. i got different answers from everyone every time i contacted them. stay away from this phone and do not buy cell phones on amazon.
the phone appears to be okay and is working fine, i'm just weary of it being a previously returned product due to the torn open packaging.
if you are on the fence about what you want in a phone, i highly recommend samsung brand, but also specifically either this phone, or the samsung s9+.  my mom got this phone after years of using a s4 and her transition was very smooth.  although this phone has a lot of bangs and whistles, i think she has gotten used to using it far faster than we thought she would.  she is taking and sending pictures a lot more than she ever has before, and has even figured out how to use some of the other basic functions that she would not have used before.  she is very happy with her purchase, and would recommend this product.  samsung has done a wonderful job with developing their product.  i personally have the + and i think the only real difference, is screen size.  either way, you will be happy with this!
i am so angry. i got a ""dummy"" phone it does not even want to turn on and the best part is it isn't even a samsung s9.i brought this phone with me to australia as a gift for my dad and i am furious only to open the box and get this phone. i want my money back.
i have had this phone for a few months now ,and i love it. i recently switched from an iphone 6 to this phone so that i would have better picture quality. i did not want to break the bank buying an iphone x, so i found this phone for an amazing price instead. even though this phone is a verizon wireless phone, i was able to use it with my at&t plan. i am very impressed with the battery life! the only thing that sucks about an android is i cannot text through wifi when i don't have have cell signal like i could with my iphone. i would buy from this seller again.
this was the best decision ever to buy this phone. the phone came in its original box with all the accessories. i turn the phone on it worked perfectly. i have metro pcs as my carrier, i try to put my old sim card in the phone it didn’t work. i went to the metro pcs store, all i had to do was register the phone and get a new sim card. i got to keep my old number, i was in that store for like 5 minutes awesome buy.
great phone!  i moved my verizon sim card from my old phone to this one and it connected immediately, no worries.
el teléfono no es original,sonido se escucha con lluvia,muy mala experiencia,the phone is not original, sound is heard with rain, very bad experience.
this phone continues to blow me away even after having it a couple days. not only does it have fingerprint and eye recognition, it has a heart rate monitor! the phone is amazingly fast and gets great signal reception, let's not mention the camera. slow motion is all i'll say.i hope it lasts 5 years like my galaxy mega before it did.contrary to some of the reviews i did receive a brand new one, sealed in the box. i had zero issues getting it put into service, the girl at the cell phone store was thrilled it was so easy as well.the headphones (earbuds) that came with it are just awesome as well, kind of like having giant speakers on your head sound quality.i couldn't be much happier with the phone, it's a great device.
nice upgrade from s8+ which is still a great phone i gave to my wife, a great deal on black friday i did't think twice so i grabbed it, i would say the most noticeable upgrade is the camera  i think its the best in the business, of course the processor is fast and snappi , display screen also is the best, i just love samsung phones imo they are the best in quality, features and adding a removable storage (micro sd card) easy to use makes them #1 choice for me
this phone is broken. buyer beware!!!!!!!!!!!! do not purchase!!!!!!!! amazon i am outraged i paid over $600 for a phone that does not work!!!!!!!!!!!
wow, this is a great phone! very fast with excellent graphics. comes with some wonderful toys. some bloatware as well, but the apps are easy to get rid of. i love the fingerprint reader and some of the other security features. and for me it's the perfect size. even with a cover it fits in my pocket and you don't have to squint to read texts. all in all, i could not recommend it more!
the phone arrive when expected. it was brand new. i took my sim card out of my old phone and put it into this one. worked like a charm. imediately switched the phone to verizon. i then proceeded to transfer everything on my old phone to new phone by usb. it came with an adapter. it was easy and took much less time than it had indicated. the camera is the bomb. a lot of options. most are pretty intuitive. one has a slider that allows you to make the background blurrier or clearer. i plan to read the manual on the others. the only think i am having trouble with is the brightness switching from inside to outside lighting. i thought i set it to adjust automatically but i have had to change it manually everytime i go outside. again hopefully the manual with have an adjustment that works. the phone is very attractive. i choose the blue one. it is not as light as it looks in the pictures but still very nice. so far the switch was easy and the pictures are great. the price was awesome. very happy with my purchase. i am telling all my friends.
big surprise when i received it. the box had us cellular logo on it and the phone was a sprint locked!!!!! . (found out when i gave the imei to samsung customer service). totally time and money wasting. had to return, and i bought it directly from samsung. (great phone and i'm super happy now)
best you can get from samsung currently, comes with everything you would expect from a flagship: uhd amoled display, water and dust resistance, wireless charging, iris and fingerprint scanners, fast charging included in the box, headphone jack and a pair of nice akg earbuds,microsd slot for expanded storage etc. fast, snappy and stylish. its samsung's flagship phone and iphone's main competition for a reason. the only ""bad thing"" i would say is that if you already have an s8 then the s9 is not worth the upgrade.
phone is very sluggish and non responsive to touch most of the time.
purchased the phone on cyber monday and all was great for the first like 3 weeks.  then periodically the phone would stop charging, saying that there was water in the charging outlet when there wasn't.  after a while it just stopped charging entirely unless using a wireless charging port.  mind you, we've had the phone for less than 2 months at this point.  sent the phone into samsung and they said the phone was out of warranty.  we specifically chose the phone option with a warranty, which cost more, for this reason.  currently on the phone with amazon and my partner's talking to samsung to see what our options are, what a complete waste of time.
this phone was great the first two months i had it. after that, my screen, my apps, everything would started to freeze more often than usual. it just got to the point when i closed out, my entire phone went black and wouldn't let me back in the phone. this doesn't seem normal anymore and it hasn't fallen or anything. no sorts of damage or anything.  so i dont understand why its doing this. if you do, let me know. i spent almost $800 and that's a arm and leg for me.
the speaker distorts really bad when the music is at high volume. the reason i bought this was for the camera and the new speakers. the camera's front flash when on whatsapp conversations does not work. if you need to send someone a picture, you have to go the the camera itself, take the picture then go back into whatsapp to send it. i mean its not a huge deal but i'd like if the front flash worked in whatsapp. all in all, good phone but mehhh!
i was so nervous about getting this phone after reading some of the reviews, but i'm happy to say i've had it almost a month so far and still no complaints. i use verizon towers through straight talk and had no issue setting it up myself. it is all glass so i recommend a nice case and screen protector. the camera is amazing and the set up is really nice. i also loved that it didn't come with all the random apps that i never used on my old phones.
when i called samasung tech support about the s9+ muffled quality of the phone's microphone (complaints from people i've called), i discovered, from samsung, there was only 5-months of warranty remaining. the phone is supposed to have a 1-year warranty.calling amazon, they now tell me that the warranty began when they took possession of the phone, not when i take possession of the phone. now, samsung includes all the warranty information in the packaging, however amazon doesn't deem it necessary to provide clear-and-full disclosure of this important bit of information. this lack of full disclosure could be extremely expensive. to be clear, you're getting a perfectly new phone from amazon but...without the full warranty.i am, of course returning the phone. sad, that i have been very pleased with amazon for a long time only to discover this lack of clear disclosure in the packaging. i am well aware the phone has a 1-year warranty, but you must dig through the fine print to find this is not true if purchased through amazon. if your new phone is sitting on a shelf in their warehouse, then your warranty is slowly expiring.after discovering this, i had no interest in trouble shooting a problem with the s9+ micorphone which turns out to not be compatible with the new, higher-quality, high-security standard of volte phone calling. with the s9+, you're paying for this feature on this next generation phone -- though samsungs product, here, is flawed. samsung's work around is to deactivate your 4g volte feature. this means audio and video calls are reverted back to the fuzzy dark ages.
i bought this for my dad to activate as a verizon phone.  it is not the same phone you'd get at verizon. he spent so much time calling samsung and they told him this-this phone will not have the identical capabilities as what you'd buy at verizon. specifically, the video call feature with another android, and will not using wifi for calls if you don't have cell service. these are two big things that doesn't make sense to go without when you pay this much for a phone.  so upset.
so if the phone worked i'd give it 4 or 5 stars but not being able to charge by wire is a very big bug apparently not too uncommon for this phone.  i can charge it wirelessly, i can connect the phone to my laptop and perform the samsung smart switch backup process, but for some unknown reason it fails to charge through the usb port.  service to samsung has been above average but its outsourced overseas scripted help - this takes extra time spent try to explain the symptoms and get the desired support.  naturally with a suspect hardware error i now have the undesirable task of shipping the phone to them, waiting for it to be repaired/replaced, and then waiting for the return,  from what i'm told that sounds like a two week turnaround.  this is a flagship phone.  samsung is a big seller of these phones.  support should be much stronger imho - such as accelerated return and repair for such a new phone.battery life has been good, wifi and bluetooth have been solid and aren't draining my battery, screen look great, find the bixby button to be in an annoying location often accidentally pressed and then more time wasted to cancel it.  have had no system locks or unexpected reboots unlike my former platform.  wish it did other things that the last phone did such as hands free txt while driving.  the email apps i've used thusfar leave desirable room for improvements such as the ability to place email folders at the home screen - less clicks to see stuff.
i got this phone on black friday with fancy price. i was hoping this will be a good choice but i think i made bad choice.  here are the reasons1. phone signal: the phone displays very bad signal with att provider. i thought it will be provider issue and talked to them. they said this model has issues.2. no wifi calling option: this model is not usa att phone variant so this is not compatible with wifi calling. wifi calling helps when the signal is almost no or very weak. we can connect to the wifi and then use that to make calls. this is completely gone. i had note-5 and it was having good signal and wifi on same places.3. calls dropping: called the provider and they said same. it is the model issue and not sim card issue4. after all these hassles, called att and asked for replacement sim and adding the replacement sim did not help.these are all the reasons that i dont recommend this to others. i am also going to call amazon and see what options do i have to return.
wow. after 3 days of using (without a single drop) i've noticed the camera's glass cover is cracked. next day i am already having dust particles under it. quick google and i see i am not the only one (there are many). i've noticed this last night after i left a warm building and on the outside it was pretty cold. the funny thing is that many other users with this problem noticed that the temperature difference might be the problem. and yeah, most of them have owned their samsung phones for only few days/weeks too. so it seems like if it doesn't happen to you in few weeks/months after buying then you are safe. i am extremely disappointed. i own old iphone se, nexus 5 and iphone 4 where the last one is being used by my kid as a toy (!!) and non of these have broken either front glass or camera glass.
i was an apple fan but since ios phones were getting so expensive every year i decided to give samsung a try, which was a huge mistake. dont get me wrong this is a nice looking phone the battery is great i can go one full day without charging it, heavy user. the screen resolution is awesome and the sound is great. but after 4 months my s9+ started to slow down and now it just doesn't respond at all.  the screen frequently freezes and and goes completely blank. i try to turn it on and off but it doesn't work and a message appears on my screen (i have attached a pic of the message).  i think i may go back to ios.
ordered the phone and noticed during setup that the phone didn't quite ""feel"" like a flagship phone should...i ended up googling how to tell if it was fake or not and found a video confirming it was....i started the return process i'll update when it's taken care ofedit: still upset about the whole situation, but amazon took care of return in a timely manner....so....there's that.
everything is great on this phone, but one thing. the touch! apparently, it is a known issue that the s9 and s9plus have horrible touch sensitivity issues. you can't type two words without wanting to throw the phone across the room. and it is in every app. even the screen pattern to unlock makes me want throw it down and cry. i hate this phone that i buy this year for black friday, got it the next day and less than 3 weeks later, i want my money back. wait or the 10 to come out.
the box i received didn't have a phone in it. it seems that it has happened to other people who bought this product looking at other reviews. in the box i only had a cheap plastic phone case. there was no accessory in it or anything.
i used to buy cheaper moto g phones i'm glad i finally bought something decent. the display is impressive and the bar at the top it more appealing to the eye than the notch on the iphone xr and xs or the pixel 3. camera is really good to and takes some impressive shots. i get a full day out of the battery using a mix of maps, camera and streaming music (normally for most of the day). the inclusion of wired akg head phones is nice and the headphone port means there is compatibility with a range or portable amplifiers. i don't get why this isn't on other phones as not having it really limits your choice in headphones or you have to have a dac/amp comb. sound quality is good i from the onboard dac/amp but i don't know about driving and thing larger than in ears. bixby is ok, i tend to use googles assistant if i need to. having the sd card slot is nice and allows for easy upgrade of the storage and for me to easily pull images i want to work on using my mac from the phone with out having to mess around with bluetooth or file transfer.
great screen, fast processor, beautiful phone.  camera is amazing.  must say, after 10+ years of being an iphone fan, this s9 kicks my old iphone's rear.  love the functionality, smart design, and flexibility.  and almost half the price of an iphone. took me about two weeks to get used to android, but it is so much more useful than mono-button. over-controlling ios.  great phone and great operating system.  i am a convert!
i would give it 5 stars if it gave me my phone case but other than that, this is a wonderful device. i was actually a little disappointed in the size because i was expecting it to be taller and a little bit wider but i got use with it so far. i use a sansung j7 so i am used with widescreen but other than that i love the new phone, i can finally use 4g wifi~
only att branded phones have wifi calling and visual voicemail by att.  do not get unlocked phones if you are on att. you will eventually regret it because there are many other features that att keeps for their own phones.
i am having issues with my unlocked s9 model sm-g960u.  the hardware i received is perfectly fine and in fact the s9 is probably the most beautiful phone i've ever laid eyes on and its a damn shame that i am going to be returning this one.  i bought mine from jd electronics at an amazing price of 563$. however, i would gladly have paid more for a phone with no issues.  i've received numerous error messages and quirks that lead me to believe this phone has been region locked or has an incompatible firmware.software update: one of the first things i tried to do with this phone was downloading updates for it.  when you navigate to settings > software update > download updates manually | the phone displays ""registering device"" and then ""processing failed.""samsung pay: when i try to open it says ""access to smasung pay has been denied. unauthorized modifications have been made to your device"" this means somehow the ""knox counter"" has been tripped on this device, which supposedly detects when someone roots it.  the next time i tried to open it says samsung pay is not supported on this device.  a samsung!region: after experiencing these quirks i went to settings > about phone | where i discovered the region is set to united arab emirates.  why would that be? the product even said united state warranty in the description?bixby:  when i swipe left to bixby home, scrolling down to the news cards ""newsroom"" ""youtube"" ""yahoo"" etc... all display headlines in chinese and take me to chinese websites.  the language is set to english in phone and bixby settings.samsung +: after experiencing much slower youtube speeds over mobile data than my previous s7 active, i downloaded samsung+ to do a speed test.  when i navigate to samsung+ > diagnostic tools > connection speed test > mobile > start speed test | it says ""connected to at&t lte network, displays a ping reading for a few seconds, then says ""test cancelled"".samsung smart switch: samsung smart switch will not recognize my device, saying it is incompatible.all of theses quirks lead me to beleive something is seriously defective or incompatible about my version of this phone.  i can't download software updates. i can't connect to smart switch on pc.  i am having serious anxiety over this purchase and warn anyone from buying such an expensive item from a third party seller.  i put a return/refund request to jd electronics and have not heard back from them yet.  will update this if they contact me.
if your a android person this phone will please you undoubtedly. my favorite feature is the camera, but despise the dedicated bixby button on the left side beneath the volume. heard you can customize it and make it into whatever you want instead of bixby, which i'm going to have to look further into as that's my only pet peeve with this phone.
i have had the phone for about 2 weeks now. for the most part, i love it. huge upgrade and so much faster than my previous s5. however, i'm not a big fan of the curved edges. i was a little hesitant to purchase this due to reviews saying the phone was missing from the box, but i am glad i did. this was the cheapest unlocked s9 that i found.  nothing was missing. this phone included the fast charge cable with block, ear buds with 3 sets of different size tips, sim card removal key, and a female usb a to a male usb c adapter to transfer data from your old phone to the new one. i will update this after i have had the phone longer but as of right now i'm a happy customer.
beautiful phone, a smooth operator. fast, slick (literally and figuratively), a fantastically marvelous piece of tech.i have returned this phone because there is this wretched little bixby button directly opposite the power button, where by squeezing the power, i invariably re-activate bixby, which was disabled per intructions.it could have been such a great phone.yes, technically i can disable the button if i sign up for a samsung account so that i can change the settings in bixby. sorry, samsung, i don't want my phone activities reporting to your mothership.
phone having issues with recieving phone call network provider said it's not on there end. it's the phone...
i already had a samsung galaxy 9 plus, but i shattered the screen. i knew i still needed to make payments on it and didn't want to pay the full amount for another phone. i wasn't happy i had to buy used, but let me tell you when i got this in.... i'll never buy new again unless it beats a certified refurbished price from amazon! i can not believe how new it felt when i opened the box. it even had the liquid protector on! which is my only negative comment, i had a liquid on my old one when it shattered so i prefer glass so i did order that when i ordered the new one, but a protector wasn't even expected! fast delivery, exceeded my expectations!
the bixby button is a joke. worst cell phone feature ever.  if it weren't for the awful button, i might have given bixby a try.  i mean really, who wants or needs a button dedicated to opening a virtual assistant!?!?  no one that's who.  the button should have been for the camera.aside from that, great phone.  all functions work well and are generally intuitive.update: latest update allows you repurpose the bixby button, making it slightly less worthless. downside is that it forces you to keep bixby enabled.  one press let's you open an app of your choice (such as the camera app), two presses opens bixby.
i ordered the samsung galaxy s9 unlocked smartphone for my wife, she simply loves it.  it has so many smart features and all the technology you come to expect in a ""smart phone.""  it takes great pictures and with 64gb you can download countless, pics, contacts, etc.
i'm very upset over this item, i've wanted this phone for months and when i finally buy it and take it to my carrier, they can't activate it. when they put the sim card in it says ""phone not allowed"". i spent over an hour calling different numbers to figure out what was going on and the only nswer i got was that it must not be unlocked like it said it was. i called amazon support and they researched it and said  that it's supposed to work with metropcs, band they don't under why it isnt. amazonis refunding my money but it still upsets me because i had my heart set on it.
when i first bought this phone, i was a little perturbed. i bought it when it was first released, and there was an issue either with the os or spotify that ate memory, causing me to have to reboot it every night. there has since been a software update which fixed the issue (issue was fixed after a samsung update, not a spotify update, so i think it was them), and now the phone is great.amazing memory. no need to clear out old apps or photos or videos. runs fast with no issues. and even if you did start to have a problem, there's a built in system optimizer so you don't have to download an app that's actually going to make it worse.the only issue i have is with the ""edge"" feature. it does not integrate well with a lot of social media, so some pictures (ex instagram stories) are cut off on the sides.
i got my unlocked samsung galaxy s9, it works with cricket wireless! just plugged in my sim card and it works perfectly. very happy with my purchase. i purchased this phone with amazon, i was thinking about purchasing it with a third party seller because it's cheaper, however i didn't feel like risking anything so i chose not to. so far i love the phone!
the true color of this device (coral blue) isn't well represented in cook position to real life. the phone is soooooo much richer in color. the device isn't too long and fits decently in my hand. android got a real big overhaul from what i remember years ago since my s4 and s2. it doesn't seem to be a real sacrifice switching from an iphone 6s. bixby button down he do much for me so i disabled it within a week. only things i would like like to see is a texture back bverson of these devices...yes there are skins to apply but having an alternative would be nice...
this phone is great. not cheap,but a bad pick for me. i did not need this much phone. all these features i probably never use. i also have a samsung tv and i must say it was easy doing the screen mirroring thing. netflix from my phone to tv. so the phones great and i give it five stars, but being new to smart phones i bought more phone than i need and would not buy it again.
got this on sale for a good deal and i am impressed with the sound quality, the camera, pretty much everything. i was replacing an s5 so i was a bit behind on the phones. it was easy to set up, i just had to visit my verizon store and buy a sim card because the s5 wouldn't work. it was around $10 bucks. comes with headphones and a handy device that lets you port all of your stuff from your old phone, into the new one. overall, i am satisfied with this phone, hopefully it lasts me as long as the s5 did!
samsung has removed the built in android transfer option. setting up this phone and transferring your data and settings is infuriating. considering returning the phone as this is arduous. the promises from samsung that their smart switch application will work with any android 4.1 or later phone is plainly false as the application is incompatable with my android 7.0 phone.bixby is an annoyance that should be completely removed; google assistant already does a better job.overall, this phone is nothing but an infuriating attempt for samsung to enforce brand loyalty by making ti painful to move to or from a galaxy device.
i took a long time choosing a phone; they cost so much now & i plan to keep this one for a long time. i also want to change service providers with my own phone. i really liked this galaxy s9, but every time i read a negative review about s9s or s8s i had to chase down information proving or disproving it. i didn't know if i could afford an s9.  when i was ready, i chose this s9 in orchid - i'd been watching it daily. the camera is as great as reviews everywhere say it is, and there are so many upgrades since my old s5 came out! i registered my new phone on samsung.com  and it doesn't affect anything that i purchased my unlocked phone from samsung, not from a service provider. there are many misconceptions among the reviews and comments. it does use wifi - for the web & for making phone calls. i saved money buying on amazon. i couldn't have bought an s9 anywhere else. the seller was really great about responding to any questions i had; i'm glad i purchased my phone from them. this has been a really great purchase experience!
long story short.wanted an unlocked phone just so i can switch carriers whenever i felt like it.i have sprint.put in my sim card and was told that this phone would not work on sprint network....called up sprint and also went to a sprint store,was told phone is locked and they could not activate it....my kid need's a new phone so i sent it to him( he has at&t).he was told that they could not port his number over to that phone(but they were able to give it a new number if he wanted to add a line)......so basically what he did was trade it in to at&t plus $200.00 and got a note 9 instead.........i think both companies did not want to activate a phone that was not purchased from them.
i read a few horrible reviews about not getting a new phone, and for the amount of money involved i was nervous but very happy when i opened the box to find a shiny new phone with all the parts it is supposed to come with.  it was an easy install switching contacts and apps from old phone was a  breeze and even easier installing sim card from old phone to new worked like a charm.  i am very happy with this purchase!  i can't wait to start using it and learning all the cool features!!
i can't believe how good the quality of this phone is. i checked the screen and the body it's almost like new and works perfectly; just as described in the listing. i tested all functions and so far so good; is a replacement my mom's note 5.as for the accessories, it came with the original fast charger, the usb to c connector.the akg earbuds are...sigh, no good; missing the soft bud cushions so can't wear them at all. didn't come with the sim slot opener.the box was sealed with tab and a label sticker showing it's amazon warehouse certified.i will update this post if something is up with the phone.
the galaxy s8 plus battery was great, this feels like a major step backward, as i needed to charge the phone at least 3 times just to get through 8-5.there are also major software problems too: the vpn simply refused to function after switched from wi-fi to cellular, requiring manual disconnect and reconnect to the vpn. my office has several wi-fi dead spots, as you can see it can get frustrating very quickly. samsung support is virtually useless, they kept on saying it is not a problem.now the good: camera is phenomenal, the best out there; performance is light years ahead of the s8, i don't even see the stuttering in the google play store, that's how smooth the phone is.overall, solid phone hindered by poor battery life and my personal issue with vpn according to samsung, so i decided to deal with it as a customer who has an issue with the product: returning it. guess i would use the s8 one more year.
i may not have owned this phone for very long (i accidentally bought the snapdragon version when what i really needed was the exynos version) but the time i did own this phone was all i need to know how amazing it was. the size of the screen is just stunning, it just absolutely dwarfed my samsung galaxy s5. it's so light and easy to hold onto, that at no time did i ever worry about dropping it. plus, there are plenty of phone cases you can buy right here on amazon if you're worried. it's got plenty of memory, with the option to add a microsd card of up to 400gb to the phone to boost what it already has. the camera is just incredible, i was able to take pictures of my cat as well as wild squirrels and a few deer with quality like never before. also, the customer service that super savings provides just goes above and beyond and then some. when they found out i had made a mistake with my purchase my offered me a full refund in a timely manner. they didn't get angry with me or try to embarrass me or anything of the sort, they were extremely cordial and helpful. i look forward to doing business with them in the future.
i got the box without the phone
i bought this phone and i am traveling internationally. the phone says unlocked, but when i tried to use the phone with a india sim card, it didnt work. when i called samsung customer service, they say that this version is us only. there is something called region lock and i am still struggling to figure out how to make it work in india. i am really frustrated spending so much a phone and doesnt work.
before i ordered this, i read a lot of the reviews. and after reading some horror stories (about people not receiving new phones or the box being empty) i was actually really worried something like that would happen to me too. i contacted the seller but never heard back from them (mizmaz), which did not help with my anxiety while i waited for the package.when i opened the box, the front screen protector film showed some fingerprints and there was no protector for the back of the phone. otherwise the phone looked clean, and all of the extra things like charger were in the box. it has been working fine with t-mobile, so that's great news, all we did was insert the sim and that was it. overall, if you are looking for a new phone but don't want to pay $1000+ for galaxy s10, i think this is a great option. will update the review if we encounter any problems in the future.
me vendieron el producto versión europeo cuando se realizó la compra por uno americano , traje mi teléfono a ecuador y no puedo hacer uso de garantía a pesar de que es un fallo de fábrica
in rare amazon fashion, this multiple-hundred dollar item was shipped with zero packaging to protect the phone box. pretty disappointing, fortunately everything with the phone was fine. but if i order something that is several hundred dollars, i expect there to be at least a degree of packaging - not just loose in the big cardboard box.the phone itself is outstanding! i went from a galaxy s4 to an s9. i had my old one 6 years i loved it so much, but i'm glad i finally upgraded.
wow, what a huge step up from my galaxy s7 edge. all day battery, even with hours of screen time. apps load quickly and run smoothly. firefox loads web pages quickly.the camera opens quickly, and takes picture quickly. my old s7 would sometimes take several tries to open the camera and then take up to 10-15 seconds before it was ready to take a picture and longer for a video.pictures are definitly much better than my old s7 edge.all in all a nice upgrade.
the phone itself and shipping was fine, but the phone did not come with anything but the phone itself and it is not unlocked for usa. sprint said it was an international phone and could not be added to our network.
after reading all the ""single starred"" reviews i was getting worried about my purchase. as soon as it booted up though, all my doubts vanished! the phone is so much more better than my old phone! i was using a blu phone with only 8gbs of internal storage and really wanted an upgrade. and what an upgrade it was! the camera quality is splendid, the performance is remarkable, and the transition was smooth as silk. the battery life is hindered due to the always on function and the already implanted apps that run among samsung's internal storage,but it doesn't bother me that much. i'm still learning of it's many capabilities, but all in all i'm not disappointed with it yet.
while trolling apple for their phones, samsung should keep in mind that their so called flagship s9+ starts malfunctioning barely after hitting a 30-day mark. i didn't waste $800+ money to buy a faulty product like this. would never ever recommend to anyone
after launching my pixel 2 xl out of the passenger window in a fit of rage, i needed a new phone. i guess i didn't feel like rating the ""waze"" app with 5 stars in heavy traffic. anyways... i didn't really have too many requirements, the new phone needed a great camera and a display that wasn't smashed into 1349 pieces.this s9+ will be a hard phone to replace. the display is deep. the camera is arguably the best on the current market. even bixby can be disabled. it's not perfect but it's my daily driver for the moment.
i decided to buy a warehouse deal due to the price.  i can't even tell it was ""very good"" condition.  looks brand new.  works perfectly.  battery life great.  picture quality is stunning.  i can't find one complaint at all.
liked the discounted price during holiday pricing. phone is great, fast, cameras are good enough. feels good in hand, screen is perfect size, sound is great for a phone device. coming from galaxy note 3 for which i paid 150 brand new. this is huge upgrade but still not worth 5 times higher price than what phones  used to  cost. phone manufacturers have to understand that. please stop overpaying for phones and make them to lower prices. it's not normal that cell phone costs 1000, period
still don't know how to use everything.  but screen is good, clarity of sound.  good pics and easy video.  but i haven't figured out all the settings and really get annoyed because it is far to easy to trip the selfie setting and often miss shots because i accidentally touched something.  also need to figure out the telephoto, it works great when i accidentally use it : )
the phone is ok if you are used to samsung... their software addons get annoying because it is basically the same as google.the phone is very fragile and the backing easily cracks... even with a case
best phone i ever had. liked it so well, i bought another one for my wife. working great in the philippines.
this has been the worst phone i have ever owned. i have to turn it off and restart it at least 3 times a day.
got scared when i was reading the reviews after i already bought this because people were saying they only got a box, or the phone stopped working, or stuff was missing. but i am assuming these were all purchased from other sellers or refurbished or used. amazon has all reviews from different sellers lumped into one. got mine new from amazon.com services inc. seller and it came with everything, including fast charger box and cable and headphones. phone has been working excellent, great battery life.
i was a bit skeptical because i saw a few reviews saying they received fake phones, refurbished phones or empty boxes. happy to say i received a brand new real s9. works great and works with metro pcs service.
ordered this unlocked galaxy s9+ on cyber monday.  got it for under $500.  read a lot of the reviews on here and many said they got used phones or they weren't unlocked.  i took a chance and bought one anyways since i knew i could return it if it wasn't new or unlocked.  i couldn't pass it up for under $500.  mine arrived and it was brand new and unlocked!  i took my verizon sim card out of my s7 edge and put it in the s9+ and powered it up and the phone had to do a quick download from verizon and another reboot and then the phone was up and running.  i really notice the speed difference with the extra 2gb of ram vs. the s7.  hope this helps with anyone considering purchasing these unlocked phones and happy holidays!
worst experience ever. i bought this phone june 26, 2018 and today aug 28, 2018 the damn phone no longer work. plug it in nothing no charging absolutely nothing so i lost my 840 just like that... i am so disappointed
i bought this phone, read reviews and the answers to the question if it worked on verizon, everyone said it does....well it doesnt. i took it into the verizon store after i couldn't get it to work, apparently it's the wrong antenna (verizon is cdma and this isn't). be careful
a really great high-end phone, i love how clear it captures pictures in bright or in dark areas thanks to the dual aperture,the most important thing for me in a smartphone is its display quality which this gets right with its gorgeous displaysound is also very good on the studio speakers
came with an 86% charge and a screen protector on?? feel like it might not be brand new but besides that it's been perfect. it is originally  at&t and needs the smaller sim card luckily i bought a cheap phone while waiting and it had the right size sim card.... the only thing is the battery doesn't seem right... it dropped 10% after one hour of use but it's still the first day. could easily just be all the updates and crap
this phone was purchased for my mom. she's had a flip lg phone for the longest time. she never wanted a smart phone. her phone started giving her problems, so i purchased this one for her. now i don't think she will ever go back lol. she loves everything about it once she had everyone figured out. now she's on it more than i am! i would highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for alot of storage and great camera features. it's the perfect size too. not too big and not too small. she loves it! i'm actually planning on getting the same one!
the first week worked great then started to freeze, and now over heating. i have had this for about 6 months. already sending in to repair.
so disappointed in this purchase order the phone and it does not work. standard settings aren't working.
the product arrived in good condition however the model number on the box and the sticker attached to the phone were different than the model numbers in the product specifications on the amazon web site. i purchased this phone because it was advertised to work on my carrier, which is verizon. i took the phone to verizon and the told me this phone will not work in their system. i will be returning this product.
this was a replacement for my 5 year old blackberry. i have used blackberry phones for 15 years, so the transition was challenging and at first it seemed as if i had made the wrong choice. but, after successfully transferring all of my files and apps to the galaxy and setting up the new apps, it was easy to transition to a new way of doing things. i love it now, but i have to admit i like the physical keyboard better, but gboard is not bad. p.s. i share membership in the greatest generation.
previously my phone was a samsung galaxy grand prime. i upgraded to the s9+ after about 4 years of use with the grand prime. this upgrade was worth it. my provider (cricket wireless) works with it and the picture, camera, and sound quality is phenomenal!! the best things that i like about it include the fingerprint scanner, the ability to shoot 4k video (limited to 5 minutes though), as well as the extensive amount of tools that can be utilized such as their network settings, the integration with google and samsung, and paired with a good screen protector and case, the durability. the only downside i could say is the battery through continuous usage. however at a decent set brightness, the phone can last almost at a full 24 hours using the optimized battery usage setting.
great phone, arrived in perfect condition and well packaged, originally from t-mobile but it's unlocked so it worked perfectly fine and instantly picked up 4g lte.
i switch from apple (6s+) and i'm really happy i did. i love this phone so much. i thought i would have to relearn how to use an entirely new phone, however it was super easy to use. i does a lot of cool stuff and takes really nice pictures! the phone arrived sooner than expected shipping to an apo address.
this phone is too large in my hand and i cannot interact with it easily as i did my 5s. screen is beautiful, os is glitchy, designated bixby button is obnoxious. i hit it in error many times. doubly annoying because i don't use bixby. camera is very nice. i've been using it for almost a month and it is very quick with a two day battery life with occasional use.
phone is great, camera is great, it is also good looking.  nevertheless, bluetooth does not work with my car (vw tiguan 2014) and apparently that is the case with many more car brands. you can check that yourself by visiting samsung's support site and looking at the countless cases relating the same issue, across a variety of car brands and models. i owned an s7 that had the same issue, and was hoping that the s9 would have addressed that. i also owned an iphone 7, that had flawless bluetooth performance. so, this is specific to samsung issue. samsung does not seem to care too much, since all those cases are poorly answered... with no solution. and remember: this has been going on since s7 (at least).. samsung couldn't care less. unfortunately i'm selling it and getting an iphone instead. too bad
very disappointed.  purchased from amazon warehouse and apparently the phone was not inspected as the device was locked for use.  also,  i noticed an abnormal battery drain and that's only on wifi; imagine how much worse the battery would be with a sim card and data signal.  i'm giving another 3rd party a chance,and honestly i'm not really optimistic .  amazon provided me a courtesy credit which was nice; however, there's no real way of knowing if the seller is blacklisted.
this unit apparently is not packaged with a sim card or a removal tool.  since it is unlocked, you can just move your present card over and it starts right up.  i had a removal tool left in the box for my old phone.  this phone looks and feels great!  i don't have experience yet with its features and operations but maybe i can speak for that later.
just got this phone in the mail today and it is not a new phone. i am pretty disappointed because there is nothing in the description to indicate that it is not new. i have no idea about this phone's history. does it have water damage? is the battery going to be old and not stay charged as long?  thinking i might just send it back.
i just received my phone and i ordered an unlocked one that should be the g965u1 model but i received a g965f/ds model and i'm so frustrated about it!! it doesn't work with verizon network and the charger doesn't fit in us power plugin!!
its been almost 3 weeks since i had this and so far i feel this might be the greatest samsung phone ever the speed is insane fast, quality is amazing, the battery is based off how much you use it overall i can go one full day without charging it and that's if i use it all the time if i dont more than a day if you get this phone and experience battery drain quickly watch youtube videos that was the 1st thing i did as soon as i got it to optimize it
i've had it for 7 months now and i must say it keeps up to my everyday life. battery life depends on how u use it but mines typically last me for daylight and it charges in no time. from 0-100 in about 1 hour and 50 minutes the most. if you don't use your phone while it charges. seeing that the battery only lasts me for the daylight i now think the s9+ is a better buy for me because of the 500mah more of battery life... but hey i'm not taking anything away from this phone it's still awesome!
i ordered the coral blue color for the s9 phone. the item picture here shows a light blue shade however what i received is much deeper blue and hard to tell if it's blue or black unless you see it in bright light. not happy with the color i received but otherwise a great phone especially at the discounted price i got.
upgraded from the s5 to the s9, what a difference!  this phone is really fast, great camera, speakers, screen, it goes on and on.  i wasn't too sure about buying an unlocked phone on amazon, but amazon was the seller which set my mind at ease if there was an issue.  i paired my phone with a rhinoshield case and an amfilm glass screen protector, very happy with both.  great phone!  you won't be disappointed. galaxy s9 screen protector glass, amfilm 3d curved dot matrix full screen samsung galaxy s9 tempered glass screen protector (5.8"") 2018 with easy application tray (not s9 plus) (case friendly)galaxy s9 screen protector glass, amfilm 3d curved dot matrix full screen samsung galaxy s9 tempered glass screen protector (5.8"") 2018 with easy application tray (not s9 plus) (case friendly)samsung galaxy s9 case [solidsuit by rhinoshield] | shock absorbent slim design protective cover - compatible w/ wireless charging [3.5m / 11 ft. drop protection] - carbon fiber
this phone is very good.  battery life is pretty good.  i wish the standby time would be better, but that is not samsung's fault...android has poor standby battery life.  overall, i really enjoy using this phone.  i highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a feature-packed smartphone.
i've always used cheap off brand smart phones and i'm not one who buys the latest and greatest every year, but i did break down and buy this last year when it was still a new product. there is definitely a difference between a budget phone and a top of the line samsung. i was only worried because the last samsung i had didn't last very long even though i took good care of it, but this one is still alive a strong after owning it as long as i have.
great phonegreat priceexactly what i wanted
recently bought during a promo to trade in old phone. phone i received was a duel sim and box is in spanish. which does not work for the trade in.
i am not a huge samsung fan, but this phone has proven fantastic. got the phone right away and it was easy to set up. i use total wireless with no problems at all.  great battery life.
phone arrived in full working order, with the model in description. tested good on at&t network (although i did have to have customer service reset the sim and program it appropriately - keep this in mind if your mobile data doesn't work right away - the stores don't always do what they should)very happy with the phone.
the emei for the phone showed up on at&t's list as ""unknown manufacturer"".  spent 4+ hours on the phone with at&t and talked with 5 representatives, but if it isn't on their list it won't work.  the emei was listed as ""samsung"" on other external emei lists, but at&t's internal list is the one that matters to at&t.
sadly this phone did not work with verizon but the folks at the store said at&t may be able to unlock it. so i went there and they found out it still had a payment due on it from a previous owner!! so obviously it's not new. and not able to be unlocked for my use. unusable. sent it back.  :(
i'm not really into always buying the latest and greatest tech, which is why i bought the s9 at a decent discount as the s10 has been recently released.  i replaced my s6 active with this s9 and i am very impressed.  the s9 performs well with daily task.  with 1 charge, i usually have around 30% battery at the end of the day with moderate use.  i've had the s9 for about 3 month now with 0 issues and i dont regret my purchase.
i ordered samsung galaxy s9 plus unlocked and none of the sim cards worked. i'm assuming it's locked. i don't know if it's just a mistake or they mean to trick people
good price for amazon prime users. also tv is great. one thing, buy a good protector !! also buy as much memory as possible so as too send photos too. fast phone and lots of apps. dont pay for iphone, the $$$$$ is too high. great pics and amazon app to send pics to computer is a great addition. as a old fart it took me time to look at all the apps. oh, get a good security program too. well worth the $$ for amazon prime members, mine was un-locked. just a footnote, most isp will have free downloads for security programs, yes, for the phone also
i like the screen like everyone else does and also the music sounds good. battery life is surprising good better than expected. but beware that you lose some options from from your service provider buying an unlocked phone. also a bit too pricey but if you can afford it go for it...
i ordered two of the galaxy s9+ phones at 256gb. when they arrived, they were the wrong ones at 128gb. this is something to be mindful of before you activate it with a carrier. i use my own straight talk. even though they were the wrong phones, i decided to keep them anyway just because i already went through the process of switching it over to straight talk. the phones work great and i am happy for that. not happy that they are not the 256gb like i paid for.
so excited! i received the phone today and it is amazing. it was very easy to set up. it has many new features (i had a samsung7 and liked it) and the typing is more comfortable, because the screen is larger.i use verizon, called them and they switched me in a short time to the new phone without a visit to the store. i put it on the charging stand i had for the s7, no problem. so far i am very happy with my choice.one week later: i love my new phone! still discovering new features. as a former photographer, i am afraid that the photo industry will take an other hit (film to digital) by the quality of the camera on this phone. excellent in every way!
there are other reviewers who know a lot more about the technical aspects of the phone. i can say that my experience has been positive. i previously owned a samsung galaxy s5, so this was a significant upgrade for me. i love the look and feel of the phone. it's fast and responsive. i no longer feel like i have to delete every unnecessary app to keep the phone from freezing up and crashing. the battery lasts all day without charging (i used to have to charge multiple times with my s5 and if i was using heavily, i was tethered to power constantly or it would die). i am satisfied with the sound quality. i listen to a lot of music and podcasts. anyone who has used samsung phones in the past should have no problem adapting to this phone.i love the finger print and face recognition to unlock the phone and various apps. i also used the samsung pay feature for the first time today and that was fun and easy.  i do wish that i could get the home screens to wrap the way they did on my old phone, but that's the only thing i can think of that my s5 had that i can't do on this phone (and it's very minor).
this came brand new completely wrapped in plastic down to the sides of the phone.  the people complaining about it being used clearly bought from a 3rd party seller. i bought from amazon and it was definitely the unlocked model that works on cdma and gsm.  my wife loves her new phone and the new one ui made it easier to switch from apple. it came with all accessories also wrapped.
bought this for my wife in aug 2018, used for three months so far. she complains almost everyday because the phone is stuck and gets dumb for a while. she needs to reboot the device almost everyday. software upgrades are frequent but the problem exists. i want to replace this.
i do not recommend getting this, or any samsung device due to the sheer amount of crapware they install. it is impossible to remove this, without significantly changing the structure of the operating system.a few examples include: galaxy themes, requiring a samsung account, remapping the samsung voice assistant (bixby) is extremely difficult, and breaks between updates.one positive is dex. samsung's desktop expericence is actually really cool.in conclusion, this is a very nice piece of hardware made very annoying by all of samsung's attempts to ""improve"" on stock android functionality. i will never made the mistake of buying another samsung device again.
i like the fact that this factory unlocked galaxy s6 plus phone is not dedicated to any one carrier. you do not get the non removable junk they install. it fired up immediately and has worked well since. one problem i noticed is that after 48 hours if the unit is operating 24/7, i need to restart it due to clutter. even when i close all applications after use.get this one. it is excellent.
this was on sale more than $100 off for black friday weekend, so it was a no-brainer to get the unlocked phone from amazon with prime shipping (it arrived less than 36 hours after ordering it) rather than from samsung's website for the same price and slower (not free) shipping. i love the phone and desperately needed a new one. the phone is fantastic and super fast. i love it.
i got a fake phone
a year ago, i went with a moto g5 plus with amazon's special offers. that phone was great. excellent battery life, and an almost stock version of android. only downside was the cheap glass screen which cracked not even a month after i had it, and the mediocre pic quality. this time around, amazon had a deal with the s9 and a free echo show (which i was able to hock on ebay). i was expecting leaps and bounds vs my old moto. however i've been  somewhat disappointed. 1. the battery life sucks on this phone! i find myself having to throw it on a charger otherwise it will barely make it through a full day. 2. the fingerprint scanner is garbage compared to the moto. i personally prefer the scanner on the front, but the s9 seems to have a delay that can be frustratingly annoying after a while. and yes i've taken multiple scans and re-scans of my prints. it does take nice pictures, and i love wireless charging and the secure folder feature. other than that, i'm still on the fence. i may just send this one back to amazon and order a g6.
really glitchy. constantly freezes. still can't find a screen protector and case that works for it. paid too much for it and didnt even get the original box and accessories.
unlocked us version, as per description.  works flawlessly with mint.  battery is long-lasting, fingerprint reader is great (works well even through a thick case, can be used to secure investing and banking apps), phone is fast, good storage, has a microsd slot.i would've loved an unlocked bootloader and replaceable battery, but most folks don't care about that so i'll give it 5 stars.
it is an awesome one!!!!! now able to use it more easy yeah. the battery is lasting me much longer, if i do not use it all the time, i do not need to charge it until the the next. is is easy to set it up and get all your data back on.
i'm in love with this phone. i was really hesitating between this samsung that had amazing reviews or (yet again) buy a new iphone. i used to think iphones were the best smartphones on the market. well, i'm happy to say i was proved wrong. this phone is really impressive, it works really smoothly and has an amazing camera, even for rookies like me. don't regret the change from iphone!
the galaxy s9 arrived in perfect condition, with all included accessories (purchased from sales pro 55). the phone itself is beautifully designed. the glass on the back is prone to fingerprints and not grippy at all, so a case is recommended. the fast charging works flawlessly and does make up for the slightly smaller battery on the s9 model (in comparison to the s9+). the performance is fast and snappy, and with samsung releasing one ui in january, i'm anticipating continued fast performance in 2019. overall, i would recommend this phone, but please be cautious of third-party sellers. look at ratings before picking one.
i bought this phone thinking it was a us model but is was not or it was a fake. i have since bought a real us model and it was very different from the ar emojis to whats in the box. to top it all off the mobile data wont work on the phone. after hours with tec support it still would not work. the real phone has android pie  this one came with a prior version of andriod.
i was nervous buying this from an amazon seller but now that i have had the phone a few days i am very pleased.battery got hot the first charge but has been fine ever since. accubattery app shows that the battery is working well. beautiful design, vivid color and for less than you would get it from verizon, anywhere else. especially if you have prime!!
i bought this s9+ last april and i have spent a month trying to reach customer support via amazon and no luck. the screen is burnt in and i read online that this is a common issue with the phone, and warranty applies. i hope by this mean i can be reached by a customer support representative since amazon is not so helpful in this opportunity.
my old s5 died so i finally broke down and got a new and holy cow, this difference is huge. the phone is wonderful. looks good and is sleek. all the new features are great. the camera is amazing. i can't tell you how much i love it, definitely worth it
i was considering the iphone x - but after reading the pros and cons of each phone on *reputable* websites, i went with this *awesome*  unlocked samsung galaxy s9+  it is super fast and exceeds all of my expectations and no verizon bloatware! the camera and iris scanner work incredibly well!
upgraded from my s7 edge to this its a little bit smaller than my previous and the battery doesnt last as long. i kinda prefer the convenience of actually having a home button but i'll just have to get use to it.
everything as expected. but somehow i see delay i uploading pictures whenever i'm using whatsapp which i'm not sure problem of software or hardware (band compatibility). it was difficult to go from note 8 size to s9 small screen but in a week i was settled. also lightweight body is a greay advantage especially when using it at bedtime.
phone seems to work perfectly fine although amazon didnt put any bubble wrap in the box so there was nothing keeping it from getting slammed around im lucky it wasnt damaged love the fast unlock with finger print sensor samsungs website doesnt recognize the imei to register though nor did metro pcs's website for activating it had to call customer service to get it to go through
bought this phone.  love it so far.  however after getting verizon service and loading and transferring data from my old phone to the galaxy s9+ the phone started getting really hot pretty fast.  i'm giving it a few day to play with the setting to see if i have to many apps running in the back ground. stay tuned.
speaker often goes in and out from being normal then to an awful echo.
i am an android user.....i would say samsung user i loveed itt!! bought on after 2 days of its release on market!! thanks alot!!
still learning about it and getting it set up fully. only problem i had was with straight talk. took 4 days for me to finally get it online. taking a new out of the box unlocked phone to straight talk can be confusing if you try to do it with computer or ai. call during their open hours and get a real person.
no problems, transferred my two chips to new phone from my s7 and works fine....expensive but worth it.
received ""midnight black s9 used-like new"" today and opened phone with all items in the box. phone seems to be ok for now but will have to see after a fee days if it works with no defects.i was surprized to see the earphones came damaged. looked as if one earpiece was chewed on by a pet. i am requesting a refund or a replacement for them
phone equipment was as expected. however, for the lower cost than from a wireless provider there was a lot of added headaches on my my end to get it activated. i am a verizon customer. the phone initially came as a sprint device. verizon store was not able to help me activate this initially. it turns out the os was from nov 2018 and had to be upgraded before i could activate. once i did this, i was on the phone with verizon support for over an hour, with countless ""try this and reboot"" attempts.  it finally did work, but i put about 3 hours of my time into the activation.
came perfect, well shipped and in original manufacturers packaging. i just had to take the sim card from my previous (windows) phone and insert it into the s9+ holder. configuration was very easy, i was new to this but i was 100% successful.
samsung ""as always"" takes you above and beyond, i'm impressed with the quality of the phone and the many services that are designed to make you feel comfortable and connected. as for bixby, i like google assistant more, but it is good to have both services in one phone. i'm planning to leave the us and i'm not sure that the phone would be ok or locked for us providers only.
the box came with seemingly everything except the phone. this is a ton of money to spend to find out this is a scam.
great phone. upgraded from s5 and this is much better. i like the wireless charging and it has a long battery life. much faster cpu and memory. very responsive. more storage and sd card can be added as well. more comfortable in the hand and easier to use. highly recommend if you have a s5,6, or maybe 7. if anything newer, you should probably get the s10.
bought just after price drop.  phone worked great, new in box as advertised.  no issues as some have claimed about returned/open box items.  can't beat the features for the price either.
i've seen various reviews before buying saying that they received only the phone w/nothing else on the box so when i ordered mine i was kind of scared to only receive the phone but i read to make sure what was in the box and it included everything the phone came w/ and i am now typing this on the new phone. i got everything and you should too. great phone and its performance is amazing.
i purchased the ""new condition"" phone and it came in very mint condition and in its original samsung box with all its accessories (i.e. akg ear buds, usb cord, usb connector, wall charger, sim card ejector pin, instructions and manual). i am very satisfied with my purchase and i plan on purchasing another as a gift.
i got the regular s9 with 128gb. the screen is curved and it is real fun to watch to videos on phone. the sound quality is amazing. its powerful enough like some of the portable speakers. beats iphone any day. camera is fabulous. pictures are crystal clear and true hd.some drawbacks - pictures take lot of storage space. i installed a sd card. but its wierd - sometimes the pictures go to card and sometimes on phone. very random.  another point to be noted is that since it is curved screen so you have to be very careful in selecting the cover/case else you will crack the screen on first fall.otherwise, the phone is slim and sleek. real stylish.
this phone is great! very easy to use and figure out where to find the settings. it was very easy to activate with my verizon sim card and isn't loaded with all those useless apps that ""locked"" phones come with.
the phone is good and all but i think its refurbished.  there was no samsung deal on the box just regular scotch tape .
all of a sudden my phone has issues staying connected online whether it is using wi-fi or not. also - the screen freezes and the touch screen will not work. apps will not load... should i go on? i just got the phone in december. it is only 4 months old. funny how the support expired 3 weeks ago, too. do not buy this!
pictures are awesome, even when it is almost dark, they turn out perfectly.  have been enjoying my phone very much with no complaints
this was not to difficult to set up on verizon, just have to dial *86 to get voicemail. put in the sim card from my old phone, signed into my google account and the phone was mostly ready to go. love the phone, super slick. a little extra work for unlocked but not that big of a deal.
absolutely love this phone and the price was astounding. couldn't have asked for a better deal at the time of my purchase.
was disappointed that it wasn't the us version of the phone but the korean version it came without plastic wrapped over it and no seal but besides that everything else inside came as it should so far the phone works great
i bought this phone in august 2018 only th realized from an individual with s s9 that mine is not the real deal. please stop selling things so expensive and they are fake. now the return period have gone and dont know what to do.
i was expecting like a ""regular"" seal tape they would normally use you know.. the circle tape, but instead they had taped it straight top to bottom. i wanted a ""clean"" box so i tried to gently pull it off slowly. of course i didn't come off nicely and torn the s9+ box cover. i'm not too happy with that, but hey... i still got the phone :/
i use this phone to run my own business and it has been reliable and responds quickly. being a female, the color matters to me and i got exactly what i wanted plus some! i highly recommend this seller and this phone!
i had the s5, then the s6, then the s7, went back to the s5. wasnt impressed with the s6 or s7. the s9 is a totally different matter. very nice and improved platform. havent found a thing i am not happy with . well worth the price.
exactly as described! works perfectly with cricket wireless!
great phone, great features, scored points with my wife - she is a hardcore iphone user but the s9 changed it all.
i purchased this phone and only had it two weeks before it started freezing up and not recognizing touch on the screen. also, this phone does not hold charge very long. i have to charge my phone at least twice a day. very dissappointed with this phone. it was supposed to be brand new, but it does not work as it should.
just received the product 4 days before its delivery date. due to the influx of good/bad reviews i decided to take a shot at it. the phone box came sealed and all the contents were in the box. it only took a few seconds for my tmobile sim to be recognized and it worked with no problem. i will definitely buy from them in the future.
returning phone...no wifi calling. can’t use  where there isn’t a network.
i am loving this phone so far. i am still navigating thru all its features and getting an understanding of what the phone really can do. i haven't ventured into its technical features a.sfar as powerpoint or anything. i have to read the manual to discover all the aspects of the phone but so far i'm loving it!
well i just received it today and everything was in the original box with all documentation. all accessories we're new in the box and well so far so good!!! it's a verizon phone i just called my provider metro pcs and they switched it over and it only took about 5 mins and it was up and running! the phone is beautiful and man i can't wait to figure it all out the resolution is insanely clear.
only just received in the last day or so. phone was new, in box, with all items described. bluetooth file transfer works. battery lasted a full 24 hours after getting a full charge. first phone call to husband to test phone had horrible static. hung up and tried again and had no issue. had several calls since with no issue. speaker is good. haven't used the camera much except to take some review photos. quality is good.
i'm sure that the cell phone battery is defective, because normally a new cell phone usually lasts the battery at least the full day and in my case with normal use the battery does not last the whole day, i must charge it again in the middle of the day so that last until night
great phone. lives up to its qualities . take amazing photos.  actually is water proof o recommend getting butt plugs for it if you plan on taking photo in deep water. everything about it was new . battery life is a little weary i guess it depends on how much you use your phone i've had days where i dont use it and it stays at 90% and someday i dont use it and it's dying could be background app use but its provides weekly updates on battery use .. all in all great phone would recommend 100 %.. shipped as expected
so far love the phone.  facial recognition lock is great and the fingerprint reader location is excellent and works better than my s7 did.battery life is great, but it's a new phone so hard to judge that accurately at this time.
this is the best smartphone i have used yet. it comes with many useful apps and is easy to control. with a smartphone at this price, i recommend getting an extended warranty.
i like that the phone is unlocked and is able to be used with verizon service.the battery could last longer and the camera isn't the greatest.i give 5 stars for the price and speed of arrival.
very easy to get started- i took it to the tmobile store,  and the girl popped my sim card out of my old phone and put it into my new phone in one minute.  the battery lasts forever,  which is awesome!
thanks for exchange of device. better as of now.
i like this phone very much ease  to operate  i don't know what happen  i carry to my local network t.mobil 2-3 time and was not able to unlock it, i was inform by amazon  rept. to contact samsung for help , they sent me shipping labor to return for repair (ticket number, (4148711893) week later ,samsung return the phone  back to me , said it been  determined that the device has passed all quality control  functions successfully.  as you can see i haven had no service out the phone.
only one word to describe it""marvelous "" no buyers remorse.join the club! loving it.
while i was setting this phone up, i saw another email had already been entered. i am returning this phone and buying a s9+, hopefully i'll have better luck with it!
this is a great phone. i am somewhat suspicious on wether it is new or not. i received the phone in new packing. all cables and accessories were included. however, when i tried to setup the phone, i found that it had google's frp. someone had already registered the phone. after about 30 mins of youtube videos i was able to find how to correctly remove the prior account from the phone and set it up. so this is a -1 for the seller rather than the product
love this phone, the picture is great and the camera rivals my iphone, maybe even better. all i needed to do was call t-mobile and get a sim, after that setup was a snap. great signal and super fast
the digitizer on my s7 broke, so i got this phone.  it took a little adjusting, but is largely the same as the s7 in terms of features people actually use on a daily basis.  so if you've enjoyed previous s series models, you'll like this.
so far, so good. this replaces my lg g5 and it's taking a little getting used to.  it has more onboard memory and so far the battery life has been exceptionally good.
after reading some of the bad reviews, like others, i was a little nervous. phone arrived overnight, appears to be brand new with all accessories (protective film on front and back of phone, accessories all wrapped, everything in box, but no actual seal on the box). had to take into the t-mobile store since my sim card was the older style large one from a galaxy s5. they gave me a new sim (no charge), and after a firmware update and smart switch from my old phone in the store, all is good.
love the big screen,great speedgreat picturesthe vision angle on the camera is narrower than the s8the software on the camera sometimes makes errors.great phone
very fast and durable phone. battery lasts for a day with regular use. camera is great, already took 1000s of photos within couple of months.
bought this phone 8 mos ago....it freezes...stalls..  sceeen voice recognition comes on by itself. not happy
awesome! i love this phone. so far no issues and it was decent enough deal when bundled.
we just switched to prepaid and decided that since i was buying my phone outright i wanted to get away from apple after like 10 years. the phone was in great condition and unlocked like it said. all in all, it was worth every penny
works perfectly on verizon with a stop to get a new sim card for it. (my old one was a mini.  it takes a nano)  i just hope it lasts as long as my last samsung phone.
i have used android all my life. this is a very useful phone and love everything about it. i have trouble typing sometimes with my meaty fingers but that can easily be fixed by changing the keyboard style. other than that it really is worth it. 3500 mah will definitely last you all day. sometimes i could be on my phone for 5 hours straight and it still be 45% or higher battery.
i am really happy with the galaxy s9 phone that i have,  however, i am trading in the new unopened phone i just purchased, towards the purchase of the new samsung galaxy s10 phone that i'm pre- ordering today!!! i can't wait to get my hands on the new s10+ phone that i have been seeing on the reviews that i have watched on youtube!!
i liked everything about this phone. wished that samsung would get it together when it comes to their tablets. phones i recommend, tablets no.
love the phonbne but hate, i mean hate, the terrible typing! adds letters, etc i never hit! have to type real slow.. otbyerwuse thi87s happens
love love love this! the speed is amazing, i only have to charge once a day and use constantly, the picture is better than expected. i seriously love everything about it. i upgraded from an s5 and samsung didn't disappoint.
perfect. arrived, put in my sim  and waited for everything to load. i run off cricket wireless. no issues, great deal. less than in store
took the phone to boost and when they scanned it, it said the phone could not be activated.  had to return and bought a phone locally so i could have it before christmas.  i am sure it would have been great if it activated.
my wife bought me this samsung s9plus for my birthday. i am used to a apple products ( ipads,iphones & etc ) i love this phone because it does everything i use it for. calls,watch movies,reading and alarms.. i like the wireless charging which makes it so easy to use and know where it is at night time. bixby ( like alex) is another feature that i like besides the big screen. i like this phone
i recommend this phone to anyone who uses a smart phone. it's easy to set up, much support from samsung.
this is my first smart phone. the learning curve was more than i expected. i am still woeking on all the many features.
i just got my  samsung galaxy s9 yesterday so far i  really like iti'll update on a later date
i love the size of the screen and the phone overall.  great purchase for a good price.  i have paid a lot more for my other phones.  this phone was unlocked!
itz goooooood
very pleased with the price.  samsung has been sending me a number of ads to buy this, for the wonderful price of $200 more than i paid on amazon
i received the phone with chargers, earphones, usb connector in a samsung case. it worked fine for the first few days, but later  slowed down a little bit.  it happended for a week. now, it works fine. i havenot encountered any further issue. it a good phone, and i am enjoying it.
despite what people say here, this """"unlocked"""" phone does not work on verizon. i bought one of these on amazon, took it to the verizon store and they said it was incompatible. the information on this page is very misleading. i will be returning it for a full refund.as for the phone itself, it is fine. it's a modern phone. but if i can't use it to make calls/texts it is worthless as a phone.
i bought this phone for straight talk. put in the sim card and it was good to go. my first samsung and it blows every other phone i've ever had out of the water. wish i would have switched over a long time ago
what can i say?  it's a brand new galaxy s9 with all the bells and whistles.  came in perfect condition and has been excellent since i received it for christmas.  would buy again in a heart beat!
excellent...arrived on time and brand new. everything functions as it should
customizable, not as many limitations as iphone, data transfer smooth overall great camera quality and battery life is just amazing would buy a million times.
love everything except  bixby.  i have just muted that feature with no problem. perfect size
picture quality and voice clarity is great.  i like wifi calling feature this phone comes with which is great for people with poor network connections in the general surroundings.  however the battery seems to drain too quick even with no phone activity which i was surprised and not too happy.  otherwise its a good purchase
i brought this phone 1 month ago im satisfied with this s9+ but the main thing is i paid 700+ dolars i i got sprint network phone its unlocked but this sprint i cannot remove and when im using hot spot i t can connect only 1 user per time and that sprint aplications i have i cant remove them i think its not fair to give a sprint or any other provider phones unlocked sonpeople to struggle with this kind of things
phone is no longer working......not powering up.....smh
exactly as described! just inserted my sim card and everything worked! awesome buy!
this was an international phone and would not work with sprint. i was able to receive a full refund.
i love it like omg i’ve reading the reviews and the photos they take i was scary that it was going to be but hey what a surprise i gotta the samsung galaxy 9+ but sadly the s10 out lol idc i love the phone
i did not undetstand unlocked meant that so.e features with own carrier might not work. sending back to buy locked version from retailer.
its everything i expected and more.  i went from an s7 edge to the 9+ and i'm in love.  the camera, the screen, its fast and responsive.  took time getting used to but i'm still digging it.
it's a nice phone. just go to an actual store. maybe you won't get 3 defects in a row.
she absolutely 100% love this phone. i got it for my lady for christmas, all she can do is show everyone and talk about how amazing the camera is. awesome job samsung!!
us cellular says you can't use all of the features because this phone wasn't made for us cellular. plus we get poor service now, like dropped calls and slow internet.
1. shipped to alaska. good job. wouldn't ship to my location in alaska which i found odd but it's cool we made it work.2. got a sim card pack from at&t, and hooked rite up. no hassle no worries. i love this phone. thanks so much
the screen cracked from a lite touch on the edge making it very ugly to look at.
it's quite big for average hand so it's hard to use with one hand. face recognition still needs some work as it requires the face to be at similar distance that you had programmed with. don't think it ever work with sunglasses. other than that,  no complain as of yet.
i finally upgraded from my note 4. man, what a difference!like going from a ford to a ferrari.
i started to switch to an iphone after having issues with the s7.. decided to get the s9+ and am impressed. this phone is awesome!!
came in genuine packaging with all parts and manuals. phone was brand new, worked flawlessly
love galaxy phones and this is a big step up from my s7.  love the color! did have an issue with the 1st phone i received, it stopped charging and the screen became unresponsive within 2 weeks of receiving.  amazon did however replace it after a few calls.
a replacement for a dead samsung s5, this was a great choice - very satisfied all around.
i purchased this mobile on thanksgiving and i would say this was one of a fantastic model in the recent years.picture quality was amazing and have a very good battery life, though i'm a minimal user (i do not use heavy apps).thank you amazon for a wonderful deal and thank you samsung for a quality phone..!
we are having problems getting data on our phone went to provider it’s set up correctly
great phone. looks and feels great in your hand. still like my iphone better
this phone is so sick. so fast and screen is amazing. great for the price. i got it thro 5 months payments. thanks amazon.
the phone  is stylish and works great with my straight talk sim card. i'm not real pleased with the camera quality though. i think my galaxy s7 takes better pictures
love the phone, saved me $300 from the verizon store. with all the accessories i wanted it still came put $100 less than verizon. activation was easy and came with a sim card removal tool, took me all of 7 minutes to activate on verizon without any help from them. only drawback was the long shipping time but it was economy shipping and free. otherwise no complaints!
phone is perfect in every aspect. the battery lasts longer than my old iphone 6. this is my first upgrade to android so i find no issues with the battery. so far i'm loving the phone.
so far everything has been great with the new device, it came in perfect condition and verizon sim worked immediately. battery life is very good.
warning: if you want a protection plan that covers loss or theft, don't buy your phone on amazon! i just bought this galaxy s9 and i can't find any company that will sell me a protection plan which covers loss or theft.asurion seems to only sell warranties through phone carriers, squaretrade doesn't cover theft, and it looks like verizon won't sell me the coverage because i didn't buy the phone from them, also i'm not on contract. i'll update this if i have any luck, i'll probably just end up returning this and buying a phone from verizon, even though i am mad at them :(...
ordered this phone during black friday. i've read review about this smartphone and was wondering if it won't work or i will get it used. however, i got this phone brand new (as i think) and inside the box almost everything was ok. there was no seal and it was kind of dust or smth i don't know. ordered it new from samsung and it still works. if anything happens, i will update this review
at first, i was apprehensive because of the deal price, then some of the international reviews, this is the u.s. version... brand new, i popped the sim card out of my verizon s8 into this and that's it, i'm online, activated messaging calls data and everything 30 seconds later!
got the wrong item
works with straight talk verizon sim card. haff to call a few times to get someone to set the data up properly, but other than that. i love this phone so much.
great phone. unlocked so just moved sim to new phone and had service. works well, lots of features.
cell service seems to be less than my old model....6s active.  at my house i usually 9nly get one bar for a signal and sometimes no bars while others in the house (same cell provider) have 2- 3 bars all the time.
all the features, all the upgrades.  it's a beautiful infinity screen.  best purchase ever!!
awesome
only had for a short time but everything seems to work correctly
do you know if you will have the 256 gig available? i've already ordered 2 phones and need a 3rd but i want the higher capacity model. phones are awesome btw.
it was a good deal. i honestly expected a bit more of the battery but since the phone has so many features (that can be turned off) it consumes a lot of energy. but the product in general fullfil my expectations and i'm happy with my purchase.
previously had the moto e4 +5000 unit batterylasted foreverwish this phone did otherwise fast function
this international model won't let you turn off the camera shutter noise and is incompatible with twrp and all other android root methods.
just like new. love my phone no scratches dents or anything. setup was easy.
i live in canada and i purchased this phone. it's an unlocked phone like it states. so it works for all providers. you dont need to worry about that. dont let the model number fool you. the model number is the north american version. the ""1"" you see at the end, only means it's an unlocked phone. everything was in the box. excellent condition. and it actually arrived 1 day before expected. its absolutely fantastic for its price. i saved like $300!
i will start this review by stating that i live in a very weak signal area no matter what device is used. this being said, i compared the s9+ to a note 9 and a 50.00 lg. very weak antenna compared to other phones! tried 2 different 9+ both had same weak reception. i compared to note 9 and a cheap lg - even the cheap lg had a stronger signal.
does everything that it's supposed to... i pulled the nano-sim card out of my old s6 active... then tranfered everything ... i have at&t...and it works without any problem... came with every thing... ear phones...wall charger ...sim card tool... and the cable to transfer all my pictures and text ...  perfect !!!
the s9+ has a crack on the back and small hairline cracks on the front screen, the accessories came scratched on purpose.
so far so good! i'm excited about the price! it's a slim phone for sure and also narrow. i upgraded from a s7
great phone for the price.  this is my first samsung phone, so far i am very happy with the performance.there is one issue.the charger connection is not working properly. i have to plug in on a special side of the type c head.
i just received my s9 late afternoon on 4/7/19 . i charged it overnight. today, april 8th 2019 i brought it to sprint store to activate the device. however, the representative tried twice to activate and said it was not compatible with sprint services. now, i have no emergency phone and we have no landline. not happy after being told it was unlocked for sprint carriers.
battery dies fast and constant opens bixby and wallet. keyboard adds space in middle of words. finger print is awesome
definitely won't need to upgrade for a while, best phone i've had to date.
bought this to replace older phone (sprint network).  phone works wonderfully and no issues getting it on the sprint network (just went to sprint store for sim card).
it was a warehouse deal but a pair of very well used head phones that weren't even samsung head phones that come with the phone... the headohone had ear wax chunks inside ewww gross. it was also missing the charger.the phone itself... it's nice.
i had samsung galaxy s6 and i wanted to upgrade my phone with the newer version. i loved everything about s9 so far. i liked the picture quality. i bought s6 about 3years ago and it is still new except its battery drains comparatively faster and is in good shape.
its perfect runs and looks great love it
used-gadget has the best prices for used phones. i got one that was used-acceptable condition but i would say it's excellent quality! the description was accurate
simple a great phone....surpassed all my needs
i like my galaxy s 9+ very much, is very fast, takes awesome pics, sound it's great. my disappointment is that it doesn't have video chat, can't set up individual messages alert tones, can't set up wallpaper on messages, background is plain white, very boring. besides that it is a good quality phone.
the service seems to be spotty with the s9. my s7 never had any issues with service area. there are certain areas in my home that have a bad connection or drop calls. frustrating
was initially tempted by the moto g6 or x4 but the s9, in addition to more sensors used in various application, has better processor, very good camera, microphone which are useful when used with smule!
no bad review or nothing out of the ordinary. the phone was exactly as i purchased it through amazon, new and with all the accesories mentioned. it has good quality of sound and image.
this is the best phone i've ever owned. transferring all my contacts, photos, videos and apps was a breeze. the only reason that i didn't give it 5 stars is because after paying nearly a thousand dollars for this phone, i still had to go to the verizon store, plunk down another hundred bucks to get the sim card and to use that to activate the phone.
purchased it, didn't care for it so i sent it back. sound quality was great though.
awesome phone, the battery life is excellent and the picture quality
i absolutely love the photo quality. it also came really fast. i love amazon and i’ve never bought a phone off of it for but this just proves it. amazon is the best! the sound is great too!
do not buy phones, etc from amazon
the phone i got was not as advertised. tried to activate it and when it didn't work, contacted verizon, for them to tell me that the phone wasn't being recognized by their system, and wasn't unlocked.
i love this phone completely, and at first look.
love my phone; battery last the all day.the camera makes nice quality photos; large display. overall great phone.
my 3 year old samsung s6 edge got pink line issue, so thought of replacing the phone. i got this samsung s9 from amazon. great price for cyber monday. the battery life is great. picture quality is wonderful. the security features are good.
battery life sucks! it will be drained half way in your day no matter how you use it. i called both amazon support and samsung support, both recomended to adjust the brightness of my screen :|
it has a glitch with speakerphone.  if you are using speaker it is a 50/50 chance the person on the other line won't hear you. i think this is a glitch that samsung already knows about. otherwise,  i love the phone but i like the older models.
i do love this phone!! i didn't think i would be able to afford a new galaxy since i'm non-contact, so when i saw this on a payments option??? i jumped on this deal!!! very happy. thanks amazon! 😊
charges quickly.  everything transferred easily.  i love my new phone.
the phone randomly disconnects from calls and internet.  it is unreliable and for a phone that i bought in october, the product support window closed on january 10th.  i guess they figured that since the phone will die in three months they should not offer support a minute beyond that.  don't buy this unless you have disposable income.
used it for less than 2 months and it has started being kicked off the vzw mobile network. it no longer can be registered on the network, so it's totally useless. amazon is charging a restocking fee. stay away, don't by if you wish to use verizon wireless service.
i haven't had much time with the phone as of yet.  i am disappointed that the description says it comes with a usb cable but mine didn't.
will never go back to iphone. way too much$$$$$.
bought as a gift, haven't heard any complaints
i love this phone, i have like 2 months with it, and i keep discovering new things about it.
upgraded from another samsung and i love how easy this was to set up! lots of cool features with the s9+
this was given as a gift. she loves it
my phone has started dropping calls after only 5 months.  i often can't send or receive texts and the call quality has gotten very bad.  i am extremely disappointed that there isn't anything amazon can do for this faulty phone.
great phone. love it so far.
great phone, used it to write this review.
el mejor celular con sistema android
very satisfied with my phone, but did think it was a bit pricey.
so far so good. never thought i'd leave apple but samsung has a better product.
very nice product easy to use, works well love the designe the color blue love it
very nice phone. great price.
great phone and great price.
great phonemy only regret is i should have ordered the s9 plus for the larger screen, but i love the phone!
loved this phone. perfect packaging and easy to set up. i opened the box put in my sim card and was done.
exactly what it says
this is simply the best cell phone i have ever bought.
best phone i've ever owned. beautiful design, screen, camera, etc....
as advertised. love the device, love the screen. i am very happy with my purchase.
i'd like to start out by saying i've never had any of the previous galaxies, so i don't know how the s9+ companies to previous models. that saying, i absolutely love this phone. i recently switched to the galaxy s9+ from the zte axon 7 because of the limitations on that phone. the axon 7 is a really good phone, and although it is an android, there are a lot of differences between that phone and samsung androids.the galaxy s9+ has a great battery life, i charge it using the wireless fast charger in the morning before work and it will last all day through a 10 hour shift plus the gym. i like all the security features like the fingerprint scanner and face detection. it also has great memory and runs easily. i can do multiple things at a time and have multiple windows open and it's not a problem. the sound is also really good, i don't have to turn it up as loud to get the same quality music as with my old phone and the display for the screen is awesome. i take pictures and they look like they are in hd. by far one of my favorite features is the edge panel where you can put frequently used apps and contacts and such. i use that all the time.so far i have no complaints. i've been using this phone for about a month and i'm in love with it. also buying it through amazon using their store card and 24 month financing was a plus. that's the only way i could afford such a high price phone.i would definitely recommend this phone to someone else. i never rate anything 5 stars, but as of now the galaxy s9+ is worth it.
love my phone
this phone really needs a user's manual or you'll miss out on a lot of the wonderful things this phone can do. i went from a s5 to a s9. ask bixby, she'll help you.
the bluetooth chip came broken in my phone. very annoying and taking a long time to repair. better to buy something more sure than something that could possibly arrive broken.
it feels like the android slips from top to bottom like happened with my moto.. i did not call to verify  my s9 to make sure was not a knock off. i was assured my amazon sales person it wasn't. think i will go
i was expecting a longer battery life although i'm pleasantly pleased to be able to enjoy my phone all day doing everything i want with my phone off of one charge. that includes movie watching, social media, emails, pandora, web surfing, and amazing picture taking.
love my galaxy, switched to galaxy after the iphone 6 and havent looked back for a second
it's a excellent phone. i was very afraid about some coments by the screen, but has been dropped several times and has not suffered any damage. i love the color, it's beautiful, it is very simple to manage, with a lot of options to play about the camera, the security, the apps. i'm very happy with my purchase
love this phone.
great phone. the camera is the best.
i am a samsung galaxy fan, haven't been disappointed yet.
i was nervous to order after reading some reviews stating the phone wasn't included or they received a dummy phone. but it arrived quickly and was exactly as described. came with all the accessories and works with at&t
bad description! not all unlocked s9 work on all carriers. only verizon unlocked version has cdma.
great phone with wonderful features,  but the battery doesn't last longer.
it s not originalgive my money back!
is your phone 4g in the us? i bought this phone and my internet is terrible. my 4g is not working at all. and the phone is not even showing that is a 4g. its terrible.
love my new phone
love this phone so much! it is the best i've ever had.
everything works except for the iris's!
i returned this phone because it was not unlocked. unlocking the phone would have cost me $39.
when i received phone the both part of the screen did not work like it should. i used it 2 more weeks to see if i could get past that and one night the screen turned black with a light line at the top. i went through the process of returning the phone almost a month ago and have not received my refund.
an overall good phone. highly satisfied with it. would recommend.
this is crazy only a charger and an empty box wtf!! package was open i am very disappointed!!! never thought i would have this issue
i broke my s9+ in less than 6 months so needed something urgent. amazon is great,it did ship me in less than 24 hours and i'm happy with my phone
love the phone no issue as of yet with phoneonly issue i had was with the shipping,it was loose in the box,no protective stuffingplus when u open the phone it doesnt have the same screen protectors u r used 2.that might make u think its a refur...its not
there was no phone in the box!!!
delivered faster than expected. phone is in great condition. i can't see anything wrong with it. still learning all the features  no scratches. very pleased.
love it, upgraded from iphone 7plus
the appliance came with the back cover broken. unfortunately i live in brazil and i can not send the device back. i am extremely dissatisfied with samsung lack of quality.
this product was being sold as new. the phone was clearly used as evidenced by a samsung cloud account set up and a user icon. definitely being returned.
love everything about! samsung diehard!
this phone has a mind of its own. very unhappy with it
unlocked us version.  i simply swapped the sim card from my iphone to this one and ran smart switch.  was up and running in under 30 minutes. beautiful screen and decent battery life.  works on the verizon cdma network and the data speed is noticeably faster than my previous iphone 7+ on the same network.  earphones that came with it sound great as well, which is a plus.  i have gone back and forth between android and iphone over the years.  my last android was a galaxy s5+ which was an energy hog.  given the power of this phone i find the battery life impressive.
wife not complaining,  i like it.
i'm very happy with this phone!!!
good phone
great product! much higher quality and experience than my last samsung smart phone. in my opinion the s9+ outclasses the iphone by every measure.
came on time and was everything it said in the description.
so far i love this phone.  it is a bit more narrow than my old phone, same length, so i""m happy with it, overall.  i""m still learning about its features and love bixby!  so far, so good!
phone calls are a lil low at times but other sound are fine. everything else about the phone so far is perfect and i believe will be a fine investment. my s5 lasted me 3 years, so i hope it will last me as long if not longer.
as expected.
as described
enjoying this phone. it came just in time for my meeting at work.
super good phone
i loved it, but sometimes it freeze, it wasn't to happen with a new mobile. i had iphone 8 before and it doesn't freeze. but i like android. that's why i bought it.
too skinny
received a international model(sm-g965f/ds) with no warranty.
excelente
best phone on the market at the moment!
good phone and has a great camera
this phone is amazing.  there is nothing more to say. the picture quality is amazing, the software is amazing. i thought transitioning to iphone to andriod would be hard but it really isn't.
pretty awesome phone that you can get a great deal for at the time of this purchase (nov 2018)
the phone itself pretty nicely. perfect sound image, and quality. lovely interface. so far so good.
still trying to get the kinks out but so far it's ok
brand new samsung s9 plus. everything perfect .  i use it with t mobile in usa and works perfectly.
love it
works as it should. sim card fit perfect. factory phone, unlocked.
best phone i've ever had. i would recommend to anybody !
reasonably sized, capable smartphone with decent battery life.
couldn't ask for a better operating and functioning phone. feature rich!
i have upgraded from s8 plus and i really see an improvement in the performance , especially camera, ar emoji and face detection features are awesome.
i just started using it, but so far it is great!!!
well worth the money spent!!
upgraded from my s7 and absolutely love this phone.
s9 in its best form.
absolutely love the samsung galaxy s9.
my new samsung galaxy s 9 plus is perfect! i love it!
glitches using coaches eye
love love love this phone
excellent condition. amazing phone!!
absolutely and completely locked, previously owned.
great
got this for my son's graduation. he is thrilled.
the samsung 9+ was an excellent buy it a lot faster than it predecessors, the pictures are clear and clean
superb phone.
liked this because it was a better value than purchasing in the phone store.  way less money for a new ph. with a warranty.
i love it! came in perfect condition!
love my new samsung galaxy s9. the best part is samsung health and bixby manager. just say a command with a push of a button or turn phone on and talk!! i dont like the new charging input adapter is confusing me. how do u charge in the car?
no seal on box (only tape). no instruction manual/terms&conditions. returning.
this phone is not unlocked. took it to the verizon store and they said this phone was not enabled for their service.
use to a j7 13 mp camera other than that happy. great upgrade even with the down step in camera. truly unlocked phone has cdma i use boost mobile through sprint network. can not activate online have to buy sim card pack and do over phone or always can go in store.
excellent
you won't find a bigger and better android phone than the samsung galaxy s9 plus, thanks to its oversized 6.2-inch curved screen and low-light-defeating dual-lens camera.
love the new samsung  galaxy s9  phone.  had a s7 edge, this is more efficient,  better in everyway. absolutely would recommend this phone to anyone.
arrived fast. perfect condition at a great price
perfect condition works great
really good. my girlfriends birthday present and she loves it
after i spent an entire day transferring and setting up the phone i realized the next day there is no wifi calling.. samsung s9s have wifi calling and this unlocked phone does not.. nice phone but have to have wifi calling. its also a feature you pay for.
the us version of this phone has a bootloader that cannot be unlocked. this is blatantly anti-consumer and renders the phone useless unless you intend to use the stock firmware unmodified...and why would you? i recommend strongly against this phone.
we are very disappointed with the way shipping was made. being on prime it got delivered 4 days late. we shipped it as a gift and it reached much later than the occasion which did not serve our purpose. very disappointed. personally i won a samsung phone and i love it.
im the kind of user that jumps from iphone to android, convinced that android offers a lot more but the problem lies in components with each manufacturer. i only buy flagship smartphones as im a power user and i decided to give it a go with the impressive s9.im extremely happy.im not getting into details and specs, the internet is already loaded with them, i think the experiences is more valuable to you.the device is top notch,  migrating from another android device or an iphone is extremely easy with the included adapter,  screen is wonderful, no surprise considering samsung builds the iphone x screen. well obviously samsung is the screen guru nowadays.everything is great on this device, works much better than iphone in bluetooth connections, is extremely fast etc.ui is very good, and packed with options. fast charging is impressive, 10 to 100 in 60 mins. and battery lasts all day with normal use.cellular signal strenght is very good, wifi is very good, its wather proof, what else can you ask for?
this phone is freaking amazing
maravilloso
really good phone. i liked how it takes pictures, internet connection is fast, and overall speed of the phone while opening apps. more advanced features to use for those who like to experience something new. so far i am glad that i bought this samsung galaxy s9.
thank u
it was really easy walked into us cellular and got a prepaid plan just like that.
best samsung yet.
i bought this certified used but its operating like it was bought brand new. when it came it had no visible wear-n-tear marks nor glitches. i'm very satisfied with this purchase.
upgraded from an s7. so big step up.
after 2 month of use out of nowhere the cellphone screen is not working. i have dead zones and the screen is flickering. i live in argentina and samsung's argentina does not want to fix it since i bought it in usa. i need a solution right away!!!!
works as expected!
amazing, all the features are perfect. battery is not bad, and everything works smoothly.
i'm quite the heavy user, so the battery life only lasts about 13-15 hours. the phone runs smooth and handle everything i throw at it with ease. great buy  so far. been using it for just under a month, and will update if anything changes :)
nice so far
love it
excellent product
love it and hope they replace mine without deadspots and issues with warranty and recommended insurance.
the husband loves it and we got it at a deal
this phone is great.  everything on it works wonderful
still working
no phone in box. just factory packaging with accessories and an empty phone spot. make sure and read all the one star reviews!!!
so far so good, i have no complaints about the phone, just got it so i'm still figuring everything out. had a little trouble getting phone activated, however one that was taken care of the phone had been great!
love my samsung .
sensacional
took phone to cellular provider for set up and was told that someone else still owes payments on the phone so it’s blocked on their system. so basically the phone was a stolen item being resold.
works perfectly i made an excellent purchase.
this is the worst top of the line samsung phone i have ever owned and how the heck you get any kind of replacement for this junk. restart on or 2 times a day because applications quit, screen flips out and goes where it wants instead of to the icon you press. try to answer phone calls and you have to back out of all other screens and if you try to close all screens it shuts off the phone call. s9+ just plain sucks
i do not like nothing
muy bueno
so far so good. i miss having an actual galaxy s phone. i've had other phones before even different brands and it just doesn't stack up to this. thanks again.
i received the phone in perfect conditions with all the original items included (charger, headphones, etc). i've been using the phone more than a month and i didn't have any problem. i'm happy with my phone so far.
excellent phones!!👌
i've owned premium handsets since the early days of android and even palm, and this phone is awesome.
no problem setting this up with sprint without all the unneccesary sprint apps and them take it to att or verizon just by getting there sim card. beautiful phone with all accessories new in original box!
cool phone!!!
i changed over from a phone that has a certain fruit on it, to samsung galaxy s9. i really enjoy this phone. i will never go back.
great product
un buen telefono a un buen precio se lo recomiendo a cualquiera...a good cellphone good price i recommend it to averybody...
first unlocked phone and everything i could ever ask for!  upgraded from a galaxy 5. saved $100 over at+t while having no bloatware.
great phone. reception could be a little better. battery life's decent. performance is great. love that it's water proof. best phone i've had. price could be a little lower.
great cell phone
i like everything about the phone. it is as advertised and had no problems with it.
amazing phone
i'm not an idiot... but this phone makes me feel like an idiot.  i purchased the phone via amazon for my verizon service 2 months ago.  it started having problems (randomly resetting etc).  i booted in safe mode and even attempted to do a factory reset.  the phone is in an endless boot cycle.  i've found that getting it serviced is a challenge.  verizon couldn't help me, calling samsung directly couldn't help me.... they've told me to contact amazon directly which i'm about to do.it's pretty obvious that the market couldn't sustain quality issues like this, so i think i got a lemon.
phone is in excellent condition.
good
good
absolutely love my new phone. easy to make the change with no problems. love it, love it. also love the easy payment plan that was offered.
the phone is working great.  i have no complaints about the phone, up to this point, at all.  got the phone in a reasonable amount of time, the packaging was good, and everything worked out of the box.
great phone. my only regret is the price dropped $100 a few days after i bought it.
after reading some of the reviews i was worried i was not going to get what was described but thankfully i did. works great everything was shipped as if i had ordered it from samsung itself.
best phone
if you don't use the phone constantly,  it will last a good 4 days. if you do use it constantly,  it will still last about 2, before you have to charge it again.
samsung is leading the pack in cellphones, new features and beautiful camera a+
got the s9+ to work with sprint. took the phone to a sprint store and the ""c"" sim card out of the 3 in 1 byod sim package worked. no issues so far. phone works great and no issues with service.
samsung superior! iphone inferior! 😂
old phone , no papers and no protection covers.
great
trabajar
exelent
do not buy. every 1hr it keeps shutting down. fraud fraud.... old
super fast.
excellent phone. does scratch up fairly easily from drops - please get a case for yours along with the phone.
excellent phone. love the change in audio. fedex did an amazing job in getting me the package on time.
so far so good
phone looks nice has good picture and sound quality, but the battery life is average.
very consistent phone. was easy to set up, just put sim in and ready to go. one draw back though, the battery life needs work, but other than that very solid.
i like it for the quality of the pictures, ease of use and style of the phone. the battery however run down way too quickly.
bought a samsung s9 got it home and the audible was so poor you could not hear the other person speaking, sent it back got another one it is doing the same thing sending it back today.
i upgrade s6 to s9. totally satisfied.
didn't come with user manual, but its online so it works out. everything else works haven't had any issues so far. came with a page that claimed to offer free stuff for giving 5 star review, it has been a month and nothing.
fully unlocked
great price on new phone.
just received my device, i'm happy with my purchase. i will be purchasing from
great phone
sin ningún problema, en caja y con todos sus accesorios, lo compré desde el salvador pero llegó aquí a california a la casa de mi hermana, recomendado, ahora paso con él todo el día.
my fionce love samsungi love this phone
product absolutely new, it works well with redpocket, and t-mobile. i haven't tried with another carriers.
wonderful phone, excellent camera. works great on the att network.  fast!
perfect
s9 is a great phone.
so far i love everything about my samsung 9+ new phone and i would be hard pressed to go back to the "" great deal "" phones.
yes, t-mobile wifi calling works.
phone was brand new, so far no issues. fits the description
perfect!
the telefon it is like new, but came without removing pin, case and replaced rubber bud for headphones.
so far its been a great phone  although the bixby button does get in the way
you get exactly what you order. there is nothing different from what was shown. all the fixtures come with it including the headset and pin. perfect condition and brand new.
amazing phone!
fast, packed with customization, beautiful pictures. occasionally i trigger the edges when i use it in landscape mode but that's not too big of a deal. i wish it was less of a headache to disable bixby. even though i have an app that controls bixby, i still see bixby being triggered slightly before the new intended shortcut is triggered. if you're going to use a work profile on here, be warned that depending on your place of work you will not be able to use custom keyboards (understandably so). it's just a bit confusing when my s7 allowed the use of custom keyboards and the s9+ will not (both phones were used for the same job, don't know why the standards are different). great phone, i'm glad i bought it and am having a better experience with it than the phones i've owned previously (galaxy note 4, galaxy s7, nexus 7, pixel xl, moto x).update september 5, 3018lowering the rating for this. it's only been a few months but i'm already starting to have battery issues. i went from not managing my battery too much to constantly needing to charge and top off my phone. i've started to have a strange charging issue where my phone won't fast charge even though its reporting that its doing so. the only charger that i've found to somewhat efficiently charge my phone is an unmarked charger i got from work. otherwise it takes forever to charge even to 70%. i have yet to contact a samsung service center but will am afraid i'll need to. i've tried ever trouble shooting method short of master resetting my phone. after experiencing these issues with the s7 a while back i'm thinking i might go away from the galaxy line at this point. will report back if i'm able to fix the issue, such a pain.
excellent deal,  i'm grateful this was  available.
love the phone, arrived quick and works perfectly. i'll be keeping this for a couple of years.
love the phone!no issues at all, i had verizon and switched to family mobile.
great phone my boyfriend loves it
i love everything about this phone. the size is not a problem during single hand use. bixby just makes the phone even more awesome. the galaxy s9+ is a great buy. value for money
i love it! the camera is amazing. the phone works great. i've only had a small problem with the headphone jack. but other than that it's amazing
the phone was an at&t phone. my carrier tried everything but was unable to unlock it. after waiting for >3 weeks to get the phone,i had to return it. wasted > 1 month of my time. most aggravating. just tell the truth!
fast phone,great pictures, expandable memory and is splash proof. very happy with my buy
just great
easy to set up following the instructions given.  i was nervous i that i would not be able to set the phone up myself but instructions that come with the phone make it very easy. had s4 that i upgraded from.
everything was great, though a quite a few months later the battery has weakened a bit and the performance is starting to have a few issues. though that's a natural thing i assume with phones, just like my old s6.
the newest s9 is simply terrific! it works in venezuela.
everything went as expected,  and the s9 arrived perfectly and is everything i wanted. thanks!!
keeps dropping wifi don't know if this is a common issue, the box was not sealed. having trouble making and receiving calls.
i bought this for my mother since her old s5 was on its last legs and she loves it. as an iphone user i can admit it's a very beautiful looking phone, and it runs smoothly and clearly.
i love my new phone. shipping was quick and well!
amazing brand new phone!!! camera takes wonderful pictures. easy to set up with metropcs. this item is what is says it is. thank you very much!
compré 2 y uno no agarra carga el otro muy bueno pero me es muy difícil devolverlo porque estoy en venezuela
if you want the latest and the greatest this the phone that changes it all.iphone user here for many many years and i will never ever go back!
whats to say, so far so good the phone have been working perfectly, its my little companion.
arrived quickly and in perfect condition. truly the best phone i've ever owned. can't beat the quality and reliability of galaxy phones.
purchased as an upgrade for the s7, wife is happy with the performance...
well, i got my phone. it's a crazy thing. i love it already. thank you. 😁😁😁👍
i love this device.  excellent buy.. i would recommend this wonderful device to anyone.
the phone over time got much slower
i love my new phone thank y'all
good
great price for the best phone on the market.
fantastic phone but the screen scratches so easily. must get a screen protector. the white dome worked perfect and hid all the scratches.
guess what it works.
i use this phone daily and the charge lasts me the entire day. great phone except i don't like how many apps come installed with the phone. i've had the s7 and s8 and will continue to use samsung phones.
i was little skeptical  by reading some of  the reviews about not getting an actual phone from amazon. but, i got a new phone and it is running perfectly.
todo bien pero lo único problema es cuando verico los datos no aparece us  solo méxico tijuana y otros país asiático
love it!!
this phone rocks!
it's ok
great phone!
lo pedí y me enviaron el s9 normal en lugar del s9+... me toca devolverlo y volver a comprar y me tienen varios días el cobro congelado en la tarjeta.
the product was received in good condition. it was is in satisfactory condition.
my husband got this phone for my birthday. it was supposed to be unlocked, but the phone we received is locked and i am unable to use this phone.
this is definitely a huge upgrade from the s6 i used to have with the extra storage and battery life but it is a bit pricey though.
awesome! came brand new everything in the box. beautiful delivery will order from this vendor again!
great battery life!! overall a great phone to have. it does virtually anything.
good phone, there is not complain neither the product nor the provider.by the way good price and it delivered on time.
i don't know how a brand new phone came  with a battery charger's cable damaged ? i need the battery chargers cable  to re-charge my phone.
(it still gets 5/5 stars because the phone was functioning perfect, just doesn't work on sprint)okay, so after trying to activate the first one at sprint, they said the phone was either the international version (it doesn't appear to be) or it was locked (also doesn't appear to be). so, amazon was super helpful in exchanging the phone for another, saying the serial numbers must have been confused.  i try to activate the second one, and run into the same exact issue.  sprint does not have the imeis of these phones on their list of eligible devices, regardless of everything (model/unlocked/unbranded) pointing to this phone being eligible.  other carriers experience may vary.
ok
the camera is great, have no dislike on the cell. since i have no home phone i use it and put family and friends cell numbers, and for work.
just received my s9 and it exceeded my expectations.
very good smartphone
so far, so good. as advertised
i absolutely love my phone. picture quality is amazing, screen is vivid, clear crops views. no regrets!!!
excelente celular nuevo y original con todos sus accesorios y caja cerrada sin ningun problema
seems like a great phone so far. 4 stars was for the price.
best price
great price, delivered undamaged.  love it!
phone keep freezing up and when i tried returning it amazon want to refund 648  only and i paid way more than that for the phone. now am stuck with a problem phone. never again will i put hase
everything works perfect on this phone,  i lov it....be careful the screen its so ease to break
i got it for myself
best phone yet
great. i liked my s5, but this is a real improvement.
awesome phone. package well. fast. clear screen. love it.
very good stuff. better than x, particulary the split window and the hability to manage/move files from/to internal/external storage
the only thing i deslike is the fact that it's not dual chip, which is something that isn't clearly detailed.  as i had a dual chip s8, i thought it was a brand pattern.
phone is great, fast and responsive, movies look amazing. picture quality when you zoom in looks cartoonish it's really bad
purchased two months ago and signed up for verizon service and everything works great. happy with product.
so far the phone is awesome!  everything is working without any issues
very nice cell phone!
best decision
very good product.
i love this phone. it is a great size since i did not want a big phone. i love the features and response of the keyboard.
i used the s7, and now i'm loving the s9
i received a usb drive instead of my s9 phone.
good phone thanks yo paments
this phone is amazing, i absolutely love it.
great phone
a few too many over complicated menus but they do give you a lot of options need to be streamlined a little more
buenissimo

excelente calidad del producto, muy conforme
definitely the best smartphone i've used in a while

great phone
still getting used to the phone but the dual camera is a major upgrade from my old s7. battery life is superb. high quality display.
caution: if your carrier verizon this phone is useless. i'm sure there're be many disappointed after christmas when they try to activate.
great deal on a great product.  got it on warehouse deal, like new and it was.
good quality. hasn't failed me yet. totally worth it. it came with all genuine accessories. amazing stuff
no visual voice mail no video calling those bottons are not available on this phone when sent.  not up front, many features not available as with att.

great phone amazing camera and the speakers sound great
upgraded from an s6, cheaper here than getting from verizon. battery life good. great pictures. love the fingerprint unlock.
bought this phone for my niece and she loves it. she was very happy with the battery life and speed.
no complain at this time .i just got it and am loving it..
perfect android phone
so intrusive and overtaking.  display is way too bright.  adjusted brightness and lost detail.i hate android.  very intrusive and lacks security.  eats data to maintain security and constant updating.
excelent product
great
compre este celular pero no acepta mi tarjeta sim de metro pcs que puedo hacer para resolver ese problema?
perfect!
more than satisfied.
phone has been exactly as described and works fine.
thank you so much for great product, and thank you for fast delivering. much appreciated.
not worthy its was not working  .. returned i did not get the full amount.
for being a refurbished product i have no complaints at all.
great phone to use. nice display. good battery life.
phone didn't had a imei number that was set up correctly. appeared to be a ""european""-settings phone. so ""unlocked"" is very misleading.
your item is good i paid the total price and bought. after two weeks i don't know why you guys charged me from my saved credit card.
absolutely love this phone!
it is a best android phone ever. period.
absolutely amazing. fast shilling, had it in 2 days. completely unlocked like its says in the description. totally worth the buy.
i like everything about this phone.it was delivered quickly. thanks
worth the price. worked perfectly on my carrier with a new sim card. easy set up and all my stuff transferred just fine.
battery fast run out.
so far i have not seen a notable diffrence between the s8 and the s9.i have not tried the camera in dark places yet,  but honestly,  since a went from the s8 to the s9, i feel like im still using the s8.the s9 is working great no issues at all, i bought it unlocked and i'm using it with cricket.i will post an uodate once i get to use it more.
the box was not seal but it looks that everything is there and working so far
best phone i've ever owned so far!!!!
shipping was delayed. worth it.
i like the fact that the battery life is much longer and the picture quality
phone is amazing i received almost a week now ...but how comes i end up with a different headphone??worst its giving short edge problem now.
upgraded from my s8. decent phone. battery life lasts all day long.
funciona perfectamente. me encanta

exactly what i ordered. couldn't be more satisfied.
it's a great phone. new with all the accessories.
value for money unlike apple
good
not a huge difference from s8 except camera . so if you want to save 250$ , better go for s8 or wait for s10
upgraded from my s7 edge, massive improvement.
great phone
terrible  lcd, samsung proved they junk in the computer world.
this unlocked phone works very well here in guatemala
necesito me envien una factura por la compra de este producto. gracias

awesomeness
excelente teléfono recomendado
can't say anything bad about this phone.
love my new fone
best phone i have ever owned
lo mejor de lo mejor, y mucho mejor con amazon prime. gracias.
good phone
very satisfied with the quality of the s9 plus headset...highly recommended
this is not an unlocked phone! waste of time!!!
phone is great price is great deliverd on time.
the earphones and the microphone in the package doesn't work.
no book included. am sure there are more features that i haven't discovered yet.
phone has a bunch of awesome functionality and has a nice modern look.
moving up from the s6 edge, the s9 is definitely better in every aspect.
battery doesn't last as reported
battery life is ok. picture is good to see in the phone but on print it is ordinary
one of the best android phones available in the market.
product is working fine and it was a good price deal
great phone, great price. smooth purchase and delivery all the way.
to sell- promote  purposes.
weĺl i ordered the phone and instead of the phone i got a note pad calender
great upgrade from s7 to s9
the phone is working perfectly! i loved it!
excelent condition. new
everything was perfect! packaging perfect. brand new
my mom loved it! she even cry.. 😂
great phone, lots of storage.
love this phone switch from an iphone
aux jack sd card slot got my money
too many missing features. you enjoyed having custom notification sounds for individual e-mails? too bad, ""we're working on getting that feature back to you."" you want the samsung e-mail app to automatically show you e-mails from longer than 6 months ago? nope, you'll have to do a search. does your vip have more than one email address listed in his contacts? oh, we'll just split them into two separate contacts when you import them into the email app! oh, you want that person to show as only one contact? too bad, that feature isn't available!honestly, the downgraded features make this ""upgraded"" phone average at best. pay a premium price, get a standard phone. great job, samsung. i'll update this with a better review if they put back these integral features.
es perfecto..
the best
no issues transferring verizon sim card. excellent transaction.
great phone love it
good phone.
it was unlocked and i love that
it's perfect. the cellphone included all the accesories. i recommend it.
i love samsung phones this is not the exception. really happy with the purchase.
i bought the s9 directly from samsung.com, and wow was that a huge mistake. i got the phone, switched over my service with verizon and sent the old phone off for credit. the next day i noticed the s9 had some minor physical damage from shipping. i was going to let it slide but thought, nah, i just bought this thing, its on them to fix it.samsung refuses to do anything but a refund for sending back the phone. i cant be without a phone, my business depends on me talking to clients. i asked them to send me a new one and ill return the defective one once i switch my service over. they refuse. i'm blown away. had i bought the phone from amazon, best buy or, hell, even verizon, they would have given me that option. i tried talking to managers, i tried using chat, email, nothing works.the phone itself inst bad, but samsung customer service is disgusting. this is coming from a guy who has their 75"" qled tv, family hub smart fridge, touchscreen washer and dryer, and literally everything else samsung offers.you lost a customer for life, and i loved you guys. what a sad way to go.
best mobil electronic device i've ever purchased..
works well
all ok. great phone great product. recommended seller
i love it!
so glad i upgraded
no complaint. everything's good
new amazing phone, came with every accesory
received quickly, unlocked s9. love it!
excellent
on time delivery good item well described near perfect.
best phone out there right now for the cost the note 9 is also pretty good
it is a perfect phone,  just what i expected
don't like the bixby button on side of phone. just in the way
i had a google phone and liked it thought another android would be ok and had samsungs before but this has more pop up ads everytime i sign in guess no matter where you buy this thing from it will be the same problem
i totally like my new phone and i have no complaints thus far and i also love the color
excelente por su buen servicio, el envío fue antes de lo programado, se recomienda al 100%.
product was exactly as described. love using this device!
this is my first time ever having a samsung phone and i'm loving it! thank you so much.

excelent! thanks!
i like every thing
love this phoneits amazinghave been an iphone fan and user for long long time .this phone is by far way ahead of iphone. i was a little anxious tabout rying out this new phone i have never used a samsung phone before, but withing two days i got a used to this phoneits so easy to use. you can customize it it's got so many features.it even gives you hints while using it.the phone is just awesome. and for those who are concerned about app security all you have to do is modify the apps settings. you can controll the apps access to your content and your contacts also.when i think about the price compared to an iphone xits so much more reasonably pricedthis phone is way ahead of iphonei usually dont write reviews but this phone deserves my reviewtry it, you will be amazedit's an awesome phone.this phone is way ahead apple has a lot of work to dowish i could buy this phone for everyone i knowon a scale of 1 through 5this phone deserves a 7 stars
great phone.
i really like my unlocked s9 phone.
very happy with the phone.
beautiful camera, super fast processor. great phone.
muy bien todo!

best smartphone i've owned to date.
calling, messaging and pictures are the best!
fantastic phone
best choise i made
muy bueno excelente!
it has a burn in
while the camera is amazing, i was disappointed with samsung's promotion policy. while the seller was listed as samsung, promotions on the actual samsung website did not apply to purchases on amazon.i also found bixby difficult to use. google siri is very simple in comparison
excellent device
i like the phone it works fine
satisfied with my phone
100% satisfecho
great phone, picture quality is amazing, good battery
very nice
perfect condition i recommend it
very useful
the keyboard on this phone is horrible no matter what you change the settings to or how large you make the keyboard. the phone is not as advanced as an ios when working with other apps cutting and pasting, sharing, or simply managing pictures and contacts on your personal computer. i could have dealt with tha t but the keyboard was simply not functional. you have an added fingerprint scan to open apps but you will ah e to log in and reset frequently. don’t forget your passwords!  at any given time you will be required to log in manually more often unlike the iphone.
good item
really amazing smart phone
go this phone to replace my s7. got the 9plus and m loving the upgrade so far. got it unlocked instead of buying it from straight talk. i still use straight talk and works wonders. i want sure what color i wanted blue is my favorite color but went with purple one fell for the color and not regretting it.
an excellent phone.
i. love. it. i waited a week to get this and so far, it's been worth the wait. ordered it new and that's the way it came.such a smooth experience with any new phone and i'm hoping it doesn't get bogged down over time. definitely a better choice than the $1,000+ new iphone, for my budget.  awesome camera and i'm still learning some of the features coming from a motorola.
great
muy bueno
great pone, looks like new
nothing
fast and great
got a dummy phone in the box.i need not say anymore.
love it

muy buen celular
a lot of problem whit it and only in 3 mounthfilm in 4k dont soport more of 5 minutes, dobr impot if used a micro, this dobt work good and take put off and put on to work.
great phone, everything works perfect but i think they should fix the battery life it doesn't get drain fast but they could make it last a little bit longer and could be the perfect phone
like the phone still learning how to use it.  i do not like all of the features. i am not really tech savvy
very good!
sólo duro 2 meses en óptimas condiciones despues empezó a fallar el mic
perfecto ..gracias..
love it
la pantalla se pone gris y no desploquea
love it😍😍
love the new phone. been with the galaxy series since #3. i am with straight talk and this phone is an unlocked samsung so you have to buy a bring your own sim kit which is then bucks and change transfer was quick and easy. phone works great.
i really love this cell smooth scrolling awesome pics great battery life and wireless charging i can't complain..
probably the best phone i've purchased in a long time. would definitely recommend to someone looking for an upgrade, especially if they don't want to pay more for similar performance on something like, say, the iphone x. i almost bought an iphone, and after looking at them both i decided to go with the s9 and i am glad i did. the display is pretty awesome, nice colors, and the storage capacity is great, as well as the added benefit of adding an sd card for extra memory. the speed of the phone is high, even if you have a lot of apps open, probably due to the 4 gb ram. superb performance overall. impressed me for sure.
i bought a samsung galaxy s9+. at the second month in the phone appear a message about moisture inside even i did not put inside the water. it does not permit me to charge the phone by cable. how it is possible if the phone supouse has a ip68 certification. and when i try to make the refund there are a lot of inconvenients because i live in other country.
this is the cheapest way you can buy the phone. new .....dont buy it referbiushed its a waste of money.
phone doesn’t work properly. it hungs frequently
wow, what a phone! everything is instant: web pages, apps, taking pix. battery lasts a long time, screen is amazing... just click ""buy"", you'll be so glad you did.
i upgraded from the s5, and i can tell you that the phone is the best phone on the market currently. i've been a loyal samsung customer for years, and when i hold a phone for long term use i really keep it until something is worth purchasing. where the iphone lacks the s9 plus makes up for. the ram, expandable storage option of 400 gb's, and beautiful display, & somewhat ok price(the more advance the more expensive technology will be) places the phone already ahead of many phone companies. samsung truly improved upon the phone, and i can say i'm satisfied.
awesome phone. i love it. however i received the wrong color. double checked and i did order coral blue, but recieved the purple color.
great phone, great price.
excellent
nice phone
is overheating, blocking all activities
fantastic phone overall!! fast oreo 8.0 os running. best screen on the market by far! very good camera and speakers! good battery!cons: phone call quality is horrible! i hope samsung will improve this issue with an update as soon as possible. bixby button sucks. portrait mode  cam is not so good as iphone x.
got this phone to replace the blu r1 hd and let me tell you it is a fantastic upgrade! i have yet to delve i to all of the software features of the phone yet but as an all around every day use phone, it's amazing! i tested the slow motion video out while i was in wyoming for a.t. and it works like a charm (except for in totally dark settings, as there's not enough light to activate the feature). should i have waited a few more months for the s10? maybe but i don't regret this purchase as it's an amazing phone well worth the price. will update this review once i've had it for six months.
the samsung bloatware is outrageous and there is no way to remove it. you can disable most of it but it then still nags you to use it. i already bought the phone, why must i use your awful apps? none are any better than the stock android versions of the exact same thing. this phone would be 5 stars if it came with stock android.
okay... doesn't live up to the hype.
i love my new phone. it is the right size and easy to handle for my smaller hands. i enjoy using the ""swipe"" feature on this phone as it can be done with one hand. the phone is very responsive. i haven't had it long enough to learn all the features, but so far, it has worked wonderfully and met my expectations.
i bought it as a gift to my sister and she love him!
not only did i receive a european model instead of a us model, but this phone did not have cdma capability to work with verizon (despite what the review questions/answers state). the phone does work with at&t which i ended up having to switch to to get it working.
nothing to complain about.  transferred my sim card updated and started using.  i really like this phone
great for every day use, gaming, everything you need it for bascically
everything works great
brilliant device. i absolutely love it.
it's perfect for sending noodles
worth every single penny

the phone is was it says, but if you just throw a si card in the additional benefits that comes with purchasing from a provider does not work, for example with at@t i do not get 4 lgt speeds as the phone was just an unlocked version.  very disappointed with that so do your research and find out what samsung says it will do vs. what it will really do if not purchased from your provider.
love it!!!
everything is okay except for the fact that my video calling feature is completely missing. called samsung to fix and they said it was a phone company issue. called my phone company and they said its a samsung issue. completely frustrating !!
has a bluetooth connection issue with blue tiger headsets that samsung is aware of but has yet to correct
everything about samsung galaxy s9 is awesome except my volume controls were not functioning sorry 4 stars
i purchased the lilac purple phone sunday afternoon and it was delivered monday morning. the phone was new, no damages as others have talked about , with all parts and accessories included like you would get if you purchased it from samsung.com. i also chose the bundle which included a 128 gb mini sd card as well as a fast wireless charger stand. the bundle was at no extra cost so the price was $839 plus tax. great deal if you ask me.  i am coming from a samsung note 8 and there are minor upgrades from the note 8 but those minor upgrades was worth me buying the s9+ . the phone is snappy, the sound due to the dual speakers makes a world of a difference. the camera is better than my note 8 and the ar emojis are fun. once the note 9 comes out, i will be sure to compare that against the s9+ but in the mean time, i will switch between this s9+ and my note 8 as my daily driver. (its something about the s pen on my note 8 that i can not let go. great phone. i would reccomend this device.
i received this phone and out of the box, i felt it would be a hard phone to keep a hold of if your hands are damp. i also had some issues within the on screen keyboard. i did like the fact that you could tel the phone to play a notification tone while on a call. i also like the fact you could turn off the call connected/disconnected tones.the phone also has some other things i just can't live with. the phone would play a notification tone whenever i would connect an bluetooth keyboard and or a hard wired keyboard to it. i couldn't find a way to turn that off. i contacted samsung and they told me that is just the way the phone works and there wasn't a way to turn that off. us customer service from samsung in my thoughts is lacking at best.i also got the notification tones when i turned on/off the voice assistant for blind people to use the phone. thhen on top of that, when using the voice assistant, i couldn't get the caller id to repete it would only say it once and that was it. i tried quite a few caller id programs and none of them worked when using a bluetooth headset to get the caller id to speak every 5 seconds or so. without a headset connected by bluetooth, they worked.the finger commands for there voice assistant for the most part don't work while on a call. example: if i'm not on a call with voice assistant running, i could triple tap with two fingers and get status information like for time, network, wifi etc... while on a call it says nothing. same way with a lot of the other commands they don't work.to me for a blind person, i would stay away from this phone as the way it currently is.
the phone is awesome. highly recommend it...the phone arrived without any damages...the delivery was couple of days late though...the box had all the general accessories that you get with the box
i love the phone, but it had a nick in the finger print scanner straight out of the box. the past 3 phones i've had have been from samsung and i've never had this problem. i would give it 5 stars but, i can't pay this much for a phone and expect a scratch here or paint missing there.
great phone, brand new out of the box
it's not even fully unlocked because i can't have verizon as my carrier. i'm lowkey mad. refund time!
*** important ***if you’re coming from iphone, this phone is gonna wow you when it comes to display panel, camera, wireless charging, android flexibility (widgets, etc), business applications (calendar, email, etc)./ but /.if you’re a heavy imessage users and love apple ecosystem, battery life (iphone x better than s9+), and the thin square feeling when you hold the phone (iphone x sits better in the hand) then you may not like this phone or any other phone..i got it as a second phone to my iphone x, and the camera & screen on s9+ kicks the iphone butt hands down!!.4 stars because the battery life!-update-changing to one star because as of june 10, 2018 this phone still running android security patch from feb 2018! do not buy samsung phones as they seem to fail to push updates on time leaving you vulnerable to threats! shame on you samsung!
in mobile networks, under apn, it says tracfone reseller!  for this price, i did not want a reburbished phone. not only thiat, but the mms messages do not come through and i can't for the life of me,  find out how to write a message...i'm sure that's something i've overlooked though...all in all, i loved my galaxy s5.  if i could find a way of charging the battery, i'd continue using it, but the prongs are all screwed up...don't get me wrong, i guess this is a beautiful phone and all for techies, but it doesn't do what my old phone did. i wish i could find a new galaxy s5. but i'm sure they're all refurbished too.  i'm just really disappointed. a lot of the features just don'[t work on my phone...not worth almost a 1000. going to return.
compre el equipo y tiene poco q lo empeze a usar y la verdad no estoy conforme por que todo el tiempo se le va la señal de datos de el internet debe de ser defecto de fábrica también en muchas ocasiones en el día me quedo sin línea de teléfono y quisiera el rembolso de mi dinero no estoy conforme con el producto si apenas mando este mensaje es por q quería ver que relamente tenía la falla
this product was not as advertised, the faq's stated that this was available for use on sprint network, but when i took it to the sprint store they told me the particular phone i had ordered was not compatible with sprint.
this is a great device!
everything ok
this phone is amazing. don't even think about it, get it.the only thing to envy from iphone is the dynamic software navegation.otherwise must be the best phone on the market nowadays.
galaxy s9 was stolen from the package.
have had to replace it three times now
the smartphone is amazing, but the charger died in the second day that i used it.
i buy this for my wife  she love it  thank you guys for keeping that good job
the phone is great and i upgraded from my galaxy s6 plus. the only problem is the volume for notifications ( text messages etc.) is terrible. if my phone is in my pocket i can't hear it. there are a lot of complaints about this online. i wouldn't purchase this until samsung fixes this problem. i've only rated this 1 star to make sure it's noticed.
coco
i really like it
sexiest phone ever
love the upgrade from s6 to the latest s9+!picture quality, battery life, the grasp of the phone 10/10!
don't buy this phone!!! samsung s9 has a useless battery. i can literally see the battery life decreasing right before my eyes. it doesn't last a full 8-5 normal use. that's without any use of videos and spotify. the phone is fast, amazingly fast. but not worth the money. def, not worth it.a phone must be able to go through a day without running out of battery. and that's cos i disabled important features, like face and iris recognition.terrible. if i were you, i'd stay away from it.
ok
loved my new phone. it arrived as expected, no delay and works perfectly. and it's so beautiful! recommended!
worth every penny
i really need to return this item, i cannot hear anything without using the speaker.
excelente
great phone. no problem there. problem is that this particular phone from this particular vender is a sprint phone and will not work to full capacity on verizon network. in particular, the voicemail icon for verizon does not work on this phone. there is no icon for voicemail.  i called verizon about it and they said that since the phone was made as a sprint phone, there is nothing they can do about it. in trying to help me out, verizon told me that they could not do a shared screen process to figure out the problem. i am not willing to spend this much money on a phone with so much potential only to discover that the phone was made for the wrong company by whom i receive service.  i will be returning this phone to get a verizon compatible phone.
love it so far, earphones are the biggest downside to it, that look pathetically made and sound bad but overall the phone itself is a beauty
had problems activating it through verizon but finally got it.  great camera.  pretty much the same as a  s8 with a few cool upgrades.
if you've already used or owned an s8, the s9 is going to be a very familiar device.  same-fish design, same glorious samoled display, same 18.5:9 aspect ratio, etc. dont expect a drastic change from the s8 going to this phone.however, there are improvements such as a dual aperture camera, which isn't an apparent change at first until you dive into pro mode, a stereo speaker setup with the earpiece finally playing media when watching videos or playing games, and a better fingerprint sensor location. the bottom chin of the phone is also a bit smaller than it is on the s8 so there's a little asymmetricism going on when you rotate the phone sideways but hey, no dumb notch right? samsung's skin is still drastically different from google's vision of android but serious work done with the s8 to improve performance is still present and i actually prefer the aesthetics of samsung experience, the new name of the software skin compared to stock vanilla android oreo.only downsides i can see are still average battery life and the general use of gorilla glass 5, which is more shatter resistant but quite a bit easier to scratch. there's two or three microscratches along the front glass though it's just the oleophobic coating and it's nowhere near the sensors, not to mention it's hard to see. that might just be me though as i'm rockin' the phone naked. curved glass is also pretty much just for aesthetics and having an option to not have them or at least just have small curved edges would be more preferable but not a big issue for me.either way, the s9 is a definite option to consider if you're planning to upgrade to a new phone anytime soon.edit: added more photos
i bought 2 samsung galaxy s9 back in march from samsung.com.my first issue was when they charged me for my exchanged s7 device that they claimed had physical damage but from the pictures they provided showed nothing more than normal wear. calling and calling did no good to get anything done and just run around in circles.  they couldn't even provide the imei of the returned device to prove it was even the one that i sent to them.i went to sell my samsung galaxy s9 because i was so mad from this experience.  i sold the phones that should have been unlocked since i paid full price for the phones.  but the phones were locked to t-mobile and t-mobile couldn't unlock them.  i called samsung and they couldn't unlock the phones either sending me in circles.  i asked the reps why they would send me a phone i paid full price for locked and why they wouldn't unlock the phone.samsung has the worst customer service and i highly recommend getting a google pixel or another android device.
i gave it 4 stars because there is no perfect phone, if there was they wouldn’t need to keep creating new models. i purchased mine elsewhere but exact same model and love the slim design. i’m comparing it with my present iphone 7+. i’ve only had the samsung 9 for 7 hrs but it’s definitely top quality. however, i paid $600 but got a $200 rebate from a little known and new website called invisible dot com.  it gets better, their plan is unlimited and on verizon, and truly unlimited, and no data threshold where it throttles down. it starts and stays at 5mbps the entire time period but it’s great for streaming hd and works as a hotspot. lastly make sure you buy a radiation proof cover not just an rfid one, the radiation from 4g is proving to cause tumors  especially with bluetooth earpiece and 5g is even worse, lookit up.
s9 could be a wonderful phone but the os sucks at this point. phone os traps you in delete mode for both messages and email, only way out is shutting the phone down and repowering up, at least once a day. additionally phone comes bloated with google everything with permissions for way too much. settings are multi layered and manual is useless, eventually you can modify settings to meet your needs, if you do not it is setup to eat battery power, and data at amazingly high rates. if they can get the delete traps fixed then the phone would be acceptable or maybe amazing, can’t see that yet. maybe after they do some more fixes. i have had two system upgrades so far..... hoping for some sanity and stability soon..... please
the s9 plus is nearly as silly as the iphone. samsung has managed to make an impractical phone that looks sexy. for starters, the battery is glued in! three replacement batteries kept my old s5 alive for many years. now i'm looking at $100 to replace the battery in the s9 plus. ouch!what's with those curved edges! my screen already has a couple of scratches and i still can't find a screen protector that doesn't piss me off. at this rate, i'm going to need another phone in 6 months... but perhaps that's what samsung is hoping.it's not all about length; it's how you use it! when holding the s5 in one hand, my thumb doesn't reach to the top of the screen; it's now a two-handed device. plus (pun intended), it's too long for my jeans pocket and it jabs into me when i bend at the waist.it takes great pictures. other than that, i'm missing my s5.
i decided to move to android after 5+ years with apple. main reason i bought the s9+ was the camera.you can get along with the android way of doing things, but what really pissed me of was when i tried to backup the photos i took in my macbook.actually i have *returned* this phone after struggling an entire day searching an easy way to backup pictures on my mac.after trying 5 different apps (including some weirdo chinese apps), trying with an sd card and everything, it was clear to me that this phone integration with a macbook was a big no for me. oh, did i mention that some of the files got corrupted when i moved from internal storage to micro sd?
pro:fingerprint sensor works like a charm.the quality of the photos is beyond top notch.the phone fits well in my hand and doesn't feel bulky.it comes with plenty of storage, which can be expanded with sd cards.price range won't break the bank and gives you a quality phone.cons:get a case for it. the back of the phone can get marked up rather easily.the battery drains annoyingly quick, even with battery saver options on. it's the biggest and only real flaw of the phone and i wish the battery saver options were a bit more open to allow you to pick and choose what you want to do.overall, i enjoy the phone and if having a longer battery life is a must then i'd recommend getting the s9 plus because the battery life is quite a bit better. other than that, it's everything i want in a phone.
never have i ""hated"" a phone. however, samsung has made that happen.between the annoying bixpy, that always pops up and can not be deleted.....to the annoying home button, constantly being pressed when navigating pages that have button presses at bottom of screen.....to the beveled ""edge"" glass that has cracked 3 times, due to cases not being able to protect it....finally, the battery life is weak compared to my son's motorolla and wife's pixel!no thanks, on the s9 series!
love it
i like tis
i have owned two samsung phones i don't know why i bought an s9 after i got my s5. the s5 as it received updates it would run slower and the battery life would barely last 4 hours after 1 year. i have now had my s9 for 4 months and it is starting to go down the same path. the worse part is i try to refuse the updates but now samsung forces them upon you. i contacted them for help and all they said was we recommend you do them and then nothing more. i bought an android because i thought i would have freedom of software use and to refuse updates, that is no longer the case. next phone will be an apple iphone where you can refuse updates and they have better privacy protection.
i have now purchased 2 - one right after the other. not from here. the litany of problems - and i will have to summarize...1. battery died to 3% first day. no gaming. no nothing, except talking for a couple of hours and taking a few pictures. truly.  2.) ringtones would not work for texting, unless i was talking on the phone. this was before the master reset.  otherwise, i just got the vibration and ""aaagh). again. it was nothing i had done or not done.  called carrier - again - consumer cellular - and was told to do something you could not do to this phone - hard shock - was told to take it to target. i did not get it from target. got a supervisor - we did a master reset. after that, i could not even use it as a phone. no texting. no phone calls.#2 phone. messes with my files. ringtones won't work with texting - unless i'm talking -  the battery bleeds like nobody's business. i don't game. i don't bank. i just got the bloody thing because my j7 went bad... and i wanted a larger screen.  this thing tells me that the ""badges"" will show with i receive a message or phone notification. they don't. again, not my bad. this is beyond glitchy.don't do it.
beware, this unlocked phone does not have advanced calling or video calling capability.  went from a s7 to this s9 & went backwards in features.  the seller info should declare these deficiencies in their sales pitch.
pros:everything an expensive phone should have (great camera, display, sound, processing speed, etc)headphone jack!micro sd slot (memory expandable up to 400gb)!available for pretty much any carrier i can think of in the usa (unlike other great phones like the one six plus)android os so more options for those of us that like to mess with devices (and lots of great apps not available on ios)very good looking phonesuper fast data usagesuper fast fingerprint unlock""mehs"":battery lifekeyboard a tad laggy imo (can be improved or even changed if you mess around)bixby (has soo much potential, but it kinda sucks rn, and that bixby button... why)a few apps should have a bit more optimization when compared to iosar animoji isn't as good as the iphone x's version (i mean, idc; but some might lol)face recognition is meh compared to the iphone x'scons:price... this, and the iphone 8 and x are too expensive... i still bought it, but still... (if you're tight on money, buy an s8 or different new good android phone. and if you're really tight, buy a good used s something or sort of recent iphone)fragile, had to buy a case and screen protector day onelike 2 bloatware apps but you can remove them thankfullyoverall, i don't think i'll ever pay 800+ for a phone again even though i keep mine for three years before i replace; i'd rather do something better with that money. however, it's a damn good phone and i do recommend it if you keep your phones for a while or you're someone that needs the best phone every year. compared to the x that some of my friends have, this phone is better imo. the x does do a few things better, but i still personally prefer the s9. coming from an iphone 5s, it's obviously a huge leap for me in terms of phones lol. if you're like me and want to try android rather than going back to ios, buy a good phone like this one (or the huawai p20 pro, one six plus, basically a good android phone) and you won't regret it. will i stay with android and/or samsung in three years? i don't know, but if things keep getting better as they are right now for android, i sure damn will. :)
i have owned apple products for over 10 years now and loved them at the beginning. i thought i would never switch to another product, but with the increasing price and little new innovation on the new products i decided to try a new product. i came across samsung and after much research i decided to try them out. i got the galaxy s9 and all i can say is wow! the camera is amazing i can take high quality pictures and adjust the lighting to fit the background, the battery life lasts forever i go 2 days minimum without having to charge it and i am on it constantly. the face id and fingerprint are great, i can even use the face id in pitch dark and it works! storage is unbelievable i store over 7k pictures and still have room for apps and lots of contacts! overall this is such a great phone i can honestly say i will never go back to apple.
samsung does not care about customer satisfaction. for them customer-centric culture is a very foreign idea.  this is my experience. i will never buy samsung electronic device again and will convince all my friends and family to avoid that trainwreck also.bought this phone new in july 2018, at best buy. phone started to act up couple months later, not taking up the charge, finally turning into a brick. and since then it was a road through hell of samsung (questionable) quality and dealing with the worst customer service i have ever encountered... it is unbelievable, because i expected samsung to be on par with apple, but boy, am i disappointed!so - it has essentially been the following cycle: would not take charge -- repair (2 weeks) - would take charge for a day, then would not take charge - - repair (2 weeks) - would take charge for a day, then would not take charge - - repair (2 weeks) - would take charge for a day, then would not take charge - then i finally decided to call customer service again, but demanding refund, being fed up with this whole brand altogether. it's been quite a ride with those guys, too! it took them first a few days to reply, oh sorry, i take it back - to do nothing, then i called last friday (12/07) demanding refund again. then i was told 48 hrs for decision. then nothing, so i called wednesday, after 72 hours and was escalated to someone else who told me it is up to five days, so i need to wait until friday 12/14 (today) and they'd call me with the decision. so i waited till friday's late afternoon because - of course - nobody called, and after being elevated again, spending about 2 hr and demanding information, i was told the phone cannot be refunded, not even exchanged! only repaired again (because they have policies that say that main board has to be replaced). next week i was supposed to get this phone on an international trip. now i am stranded without one, i just haven't got some $700's around to buy new phones anytime i feel for it.it is unbelievable that they have some unrealistic policies and it does not matter that phone breaks 4 times (the same thing) and they would not replace it, let alone refund it, cause ""it wasn't motherboard"". my communications with even 2nd level manager was just as that - pointless. banging my head against the wall of some corporate baloney - rather than being cared about as a customer who does genuinely get hit by their product poor quality.go for iphone instead!!!  maybe the phones aren't androids but at least they have some true customer service out there!
i had an iphone x but i sold it for this. the iphone x was a huge disappointment. i used to buy nothing but apple products, but i realized how far behind apple is. this phone has a much larger display and higher quality than the x. plus there is no annoying top notch at the top. the camera is better, i took pictures on both phones and the samsung was the only phone to pick up the fine print from a picture on my wall standing 12 ft away. the iphone x was blurry and the print wasn't legible. this phone has an incredible aperture to take crisp pictures even in low light. i don't believe its oversaturated, it all depends on what area of the screen you tap on and the phone will adjust the colors accordingly. overall this phone probably has one of the best cameras on the market.the specs are good, you'll be able to multitask without any issues.the battery life is about average for me, it's not as much as i would like but it's not terrible either. i use my phone a lot for business, emails, video etc.. it gets me through the majority of my working hours around 7 hours of on screen time.coming from an iphone user this is much better!
after receiving the phone i tried to activate through sprint and it wouldnt work by using my current sd card. went to the sprint store and bought a new one. still didnt work. went on sprints website and typed it the imei number and it stated it will work on the sprint network. called customer service and gave them the iemi and they shipped me out a new sim card. called to activate the new sim card and it works now ! so my suggestion is call sprint give them the iemi number and send u out a sim. other than that the phone is nice however the camera is super dark when trying to use superslowmo
this is a great phone with a lot of cool features and a top-notch camera, but i could do without bixby and the overwhelming number of useless apps on it.  in addition, price-wise, it is not exponentially better (10x) than the blackberry z10 that i switched over from and suffers from the following issues that take it down a notch:-google play doesn't download the album art if you transfer music over from your computer. it's not the end of the world, but the z10 wasn't missing any album covers in its library.  i downloaded a pay-for-play music player and pushed google play to the next page because i wanted whatever album art i could get.  without it, i find it kind of bland.-i am astounded as to why e-mails, phone calls and texts are all in different places. the s9+ should have a hub ""stream"", similar to the z10.  i found that i needed to download the blackberry hub for android feature because it provides the user with one stream of e-mails, phone calls and text messages.  blackberry hub for android is the best thing since sliced bread and it is available either free (without ads for 30 days and with ads after that), and 99 cents a month (without ads), thereafter. from the human factors perspective, this is something that samsung should be offering, especially at its advanced rate of development.-when a calendar event opens, there's no option to ""snooze"".-playing music with earbuds was a little disappointing. the blackberry z10 had a built-in optional booster and the sound quality was much better with richer bass, even with a $10 pair of earbuds.  the s9+ does have very good speaker sound, though.i bought this phone because i thought it was time to upgrade to an android-based device that could run more apps, especially from the proprietary blackberry o/s that is going or gone extinct.  the s9+ is a very nice phone, but it is a little lacking and not flawless.  i am one that will probably not use it to play pokemon or for any gaming.  the core features i use it for are phone, e-mail, music and some android apps.  it's nice having a phone that can do the latter, but it would also be nice to have the best of both worlds.
nice phone/camera but it is a super slippery fragile fingerprint magnet.  case was late from amazon, slipped out of my pocket18 inches off ground and the screen cracked.  weak.  i like my note 4 better.  bit of buyer's remorse for me.
like many products these days it's all about the marketing and hype.  i've had the phone now for over a month.pros:speakers are loud and clearheadphone amp is 1.4x more powerfulsome interesting tweaks in audio for dolby atmos, tube amp, etc.display is outstandingcons:bixby button is an annoyance. the placement is such when you use the power button you hit the bixby button which imo is a useless feature.samsung bloatware.  knox, samsung music, gallery, etc. compared to google and what's on play i just want to delete them but can't.os updates!  the half-hearted joke is if you want an updated os, buy a new phone.  this includes security updates.samsung should concentrate their efforts on updating the os and security and forgo the lousy samsung apps.would i recommend the phone.  that depends.  if you love audio, then yes this is a good choice.  if you want updated software, speed and smooth opertation i would look elsewhere.
the phone was great since i had upgraded from the s7 but the screen seems to be very fragile in my case the phone screen cracked while being in my pocket and protected by tempered glass and a phone case after this i called my insurance and they sent me back a new phone for a deductible of $200 the new phone broke in the same way as the first one in less than a week although this one was not protected by tempered glass after seeing booth had broken in less then a month i contacted samsung customer support something i would never do again since all they did was waste my time i was told i had to send my phone to be inspected and they would repair under warrantty. i sent my phone to them and it arrived at their facility two days later. after 10 days i had not received any information from samsung so i decided to call. when i called i was informed the phone was processing and i would recieve it in 5 buisness days, later that day i finally recieved notification they had my phone processing and it would be ready soon. now 2 days ago i recieved a bill for repair costs of 247.89 way more than my deductible because my phone was not covered by warranty.
very good phone but i give only 4 stars because there is no ir port. even my old chineese phone had one ! i used it to control my air conditioner.
i bought 2 of these for me and my husband at best buy the unlocked us version and when i got home neither get signal 1 bar if lucky. we went to the city and in the larger city and there we get signal.. i wish someone would have warned me that the unlocked version gets little signal with at&t now i'm giving people a warning at&t gets horrible reception
literally the best phone i've ever had, i loved it so much i decided to upgrade to the s9 plus version. here's my layman's review on both.pros:- the night photos are where this phone shines, definitely able to get every detail possible in low lighting.- battery life is massive with both phone: s9 has a 3000mah / s9 plus 3500mah- plenty of ram: s9 has 4gigs/ s9 plus 6gigs. both perform very extremely well but 6 gigs worth of ram seems like overkill as 4 gigs from the s9 suffice with little to no slowdowns.-  headphone jack on both version. also comes with some sweet akg earbuds.- ar emoji is relatively fun and great to show to people interested in checking out the phone- thin phone- 4k video quality- great speakers- samsung pay, literally can be used anywhere that accepts cards as it mimics the magnetic strip (not like google pay that relies on the ereader).- live translations with bixby vision- (plus version)  live photo mode. really great feature, and editable-  (plus version) 2 rear cameras with optical zoom at 2x and digital at 10x, and dual capturecons:- while night photos are amazing, daytime photos can sometimes appear overly saturated.- there isn't a noticeable size difference between both phones.- what is the point of bixby? really difficult to incorporate it into my daily life without actively thinking ""i should give bixby a try""- while thin, it's somewhat heavy.- besides the camera, there isn't a massive difference between s9 and s9 plus.verdict:as stated above, i love the s9 so much i upgraded to the plus version. both phones run extremely fast with little to no slowdown, even having several apps open does little to bog it's performance down. photos look fantastic at especially at night with both versions. my only issue is the new bixby button: it's not something i would actively use but at least users can disable this feature. overall it's a lovely phone, s9 works just as well as the s9 plus but lacking a few features with the camera.
the camera will not autofocus on my s9, and it's been a known problem since it came out early this year. still no resolution except ""send it back to the factory"". wish i had known this before i bought it.
this is a typical samsung flagship phone. it is well built and feels premium on hand. the picture quality is great. shoots even better in low light. this phone has a lot of features and can be quite complex. blue light filter, dolby atmos, edge light, always on and more. i am a simple guy and have never found these features useful. but slowly i started playing with them. definitely useful but not must have.why did i give 3 stars?too much samsung bloatware and the bixby button is hell of annoying. the fingerprint and face recognition are not reliable. face recognition rare works. the phone battery tends to die over night in standby mode if i only have 10% left.--update after a year--the battery is horrible. barely getting 2-3 hours on screen a day. i had to charge 2-3 times a day. not going to buy a samsung again.
phone frequently starts talking out loud (even if in your pocket or bag) because the dedicated had button pushes up against something. you can follow on-line instructions to disable the voice talking, but every time the phone auto-updates the operating system (which is forced upon you), the ""bixby voice assistant"" is reverted to default mode. so, phone starts talking out loud at random times again.do everything you can do to avoid this phone. do not buy any phone with ""bixby"" associated with it. samsung thinks it's smarter than you, so they took away your ability to disable the voice thing permanently, and they made it impossible to re-purpose the additional button for anything. total garbage.
i purchased this phone as an ""upgrade"" to my wife's google pixel phone. (actually my son got her phone when his htc m8 died.) anyway, it's the second worst phone she's owned - and we have to go all the way back to the motorola photon to beat the miserable user experience provided by the samsung galaxy s9. as usual, samsung has placed the albatross of bloatware heavily upon the otherwise promising hardware. i'd root it in a minute if she'd let me.
don't buy!!  two things are good... the touted good camera and processor speed. sound is marginal and maybe worse than previous issues.  it is narrow, terribly so such that 1/3 of my time is spent correcting misspelled words no matter what keyboard i try. yes typing on the horizontal position is ok, but awkward and you have to use 2 hands. samsung dropped individual text notices and so now everything sounds the same when notified making you pull out the phone, unlock it, then find out what the notice was for... drivel!! at least weekly i have to restart the phone for the dail numbers to work, otherwise it does not put calls and texts through. the screen touch is over desensitized with a screen protector sometimes requiring multi-touches to respond even when in the sensitive mode.  it reminds me of microsoft's mellium pc format.
the galaxy s9 is a great looking and working phone, but i challenge you to try to figure out all the camera features they show in the commercial.they show all sorts of things like 'swing' and 'boomerang'  and 'super slo-mo', but the only feature i can actually find is the slo-mo.  the other features are buried somewhere in the camera and samsung provides zero instructions on how to use them.i'm currently scouring the internet to see how to activate these features, but it is a major fail for samsung for not providing guidance in the box.
i used to get samsung products because of their google integration.  now there is a button on the side that you cant turn off without signing up for samsung's service.  i will no longer be purchasing samsung products.update: there updates continue to try and push their products.  even going so far as removing your settings and replacing them with samsung offerings.  will never buy samsung again.
camera defective from factory. ordered from amazon.  rear camera can't focus when selected. manual focus does nothing. 20 seconds later it works fine. starting to happen more often and of course i'm a day late for returning it. no goodupdate... ubreakifix did the repair on the camera. it was a hassle, but it works. the shop owner told me what a hassle it is working with samsung, i'm just glad that i didn't have to mail it in for the warranty.
i love everything about this phone, except for one thing. the battery drains way faster than all my previous phones. i've used the iphone x before to play fortnite and the battery on the iphone x didn't drain as fast as this phone does. it might be that fortnite isn't optimized for android or something, i don't know. i've also played a lot of asphalt 9 on this phone and the battery drains quickly too. i recommend getting this phone still, if you're not worried about the battery. this phone has a excellent camera, although the google pixel 2 xl excels in some areas. a nice feature about the camera is that you can change the aperture. the screen on this phone is the best! the screen is so beautiful and hq! i took my iphone 7 plus out to compare and i just notice the ugly bezels on the iphone screen. i don't think i can use phones with bezels again after using this amazing phone! the phone is very fast, of course with a snapdragon 845, you can expect it to do anything. runs fortnite perfectly fine if you want this phone to play fortnite. multitasking is very easy. all in all it's a great phone, worth every single penny you've spent. if you don't care about the battery life, this is the perfect phone for you.
better battery life than any other phone i used...photos and video turn out clearer than even the newest gopro. 4k is crazy clear and pictures are great too but i own a sony full frame camera so i typically dont use it alot..i will say the selfie camera lacks tho but thats because my previous phone was a sony xperia ultra xa1..the selfie cam was better than the rear one. lol speakers are like actual speakers too..pretty clear
good phone and camera, however tons of bloatware clogging everything (cpu, ram, sd card), not up to date android version (8.0), very slow on safety relevant updates. bixby is the worst, you need an app to block this useless crap. all in all good phone if samsung would just listen to customers.
after doing a fair bit of research i am pretty sure that many phones people are getting are fake chinese knock offs. i would not recommend taking the chance on this. they look similar but there are subtle differences that say these are fakes.
i received the product just fine, but verizon was unable to activate it, since it didn't even recognize the device.  since the device was not shipped with a sim card, which is not mentioned on the webpage, the employee at the verizon store used a standard verizon sim card to try and activate it.  all in all, a big waste of my lunch hour!!  it is already being shipped back...
i upgraded from a htc one m9 to the s9 and i am glad i did. the camera is phenomenal. every picture is vibrant, the layout of the phone is easy to navigate, the battery is good. it gets me through the day usually. the speakers are good if you get the phone set on the right eq setting. i love the display, how big it is and the headphone jack. overall, this phone will not blow anyone away but it is a very solid, reliable phone which i love using every day.
honestly this is one of the best smartphones i've used in a long time. snappy, ui is good, screen is gorgeous, camera is great, pretty much everything to expect when purchasing a 800+ smartphone.the real complaint i have is the speakers sound when cranked to full as on edm and some hip hop( these are the main genres i listen to) the bass levels drastically drop. a bit dissapointing but cranking it down a little bit and back to business as usual.anyway its a great phone and i would definitely say it is a contender for one of the best phones of 2017-2018.
""hey, you know that part of the phone where you hold onto it? i think it's called the side. yeah, we put a screen there that serves no purpose other than to click things when your just trying to hold onto your phone. oops you didn't want to click that button, too bad you didn't just drop your phone.""
quite possibly the worst bloatwear in a flagship phone, coming from a google pixel this phone has been nothing but issues. the smartswitch app took 6 seperate times to finally run. if you like wasting time then this is the phone for you, if not look at a pixel or even the oneplus.
useless bixby feature, completely useless!terrible fingerprint recognitionterrible facial recognition
overall great phone, great pictures, easy to use.  only negative is the charger- i use the charger that came with the phone  yet it charges slowly. a pop up does show saying ""slow charging-use the charger that came with the device."" problem is it is the charger that came with the device!
i was skeptical buying s9 on amazon. i was super stoked to see it was a usa model and not a cheaper model. word as promised and i’m not upset about this buy.
i will say samsung galaxy s9 is great, specially when is unlocked, i can use it for any carrier. i bought this phone as a spare phone, but i'm a loyal iphone user for #life.
having both more ram and an sd slot, after my 16g iphone died, is absolutely fantastic.
so it is going to be pretty easy to make me happy at this stage. it is so nice to have a battery that last days without needing to be charged.so far so good, just getting used to the upgrades from an s5 to s9. but it was only $100 more for the s9 vs the s8 - so it seemed like the logical choice.we will see how it goes going forward.
the camera is amazing. the phone itself is loaded with worthless bloatware that you can't delete. samsung tries to force the user to use ""features"" like bixby, that not only take up memory, but also slow down the phone and do not anything useful.
s9+ with echo, echo dot, and samsung smartthings home kit for only $1k?? i feel like i stole from amazon. i love my s9+. i was happy with my s7 edge and was holding off on upgrading until amazon caught me with that prime deal. the camera is amazing. looking back at my pics from my s7 and comparing them to the pics i take with the s9+ is like a night and day difference. even after some time i'm still finding new things to do with the phone.
worst phone i have ever used. samsung took a fully functional operating system and stripped out all the good features to replace them with samsung services that require another login. basic features don't work. i get terrible or no signal in areas where i used to have great signal. i haven't changed carriers or my plan. i'm constantly having buffering issues i never had with my nexus 5x. this happens on cell network or wifi.
will not work with verizon sim using straight talk.
i upgraded from an iphone 6s when that died. this phone is a big disappointment. the main complaint is the touchscreen. since it goes all the way to the edge it often adds 0 or p, especially if i use my thumb. the auto tire in to my ford is also buggy at best. usually getting a new phone is great but this one has been a big disappointment. i'd avoid it if i were you.
don't drop it! the back is made of glass. drop it and it will most definitely break. pen is a gimmick. if you want to draw or scribble it's ok, but you can type faster so the pen is pretty useless. while it's nice to have a larger screen it's kind of awkward. that said, the phone works flawlessly in every other facet.
just got my samsung s9 today and i wonder is this genuine by samsung? coz i got the phone made in china and not in korea and i got a headset but its akg and not samsung headset can anyone answer me.
an amazing phone with an amazing camera and screen. if your stuck between this and the iphone x i would definitly get this. the battery life is mediocre just because the quality and the size of the screen drain it. however, there are many options to help prolong it. a beautiful phone.
when the phone arrived excited to use it then boom it does not work! it is an unlocked phone they say but it really isn't. their customer service stinks and are no help.
i've had this phone for 16 days and it's now dead. when it worked, it was slower than my iphone 6 plus. had trouble with texting that i thought was due to software lag. seems others are facing similar problems and it's likely a touchscreen problem (dead zones). samsung already issued a statement that it's working on the issue. my phone is also completely frozen. even if i reboot, it freezes at the samsung screen. i asked samsung to send me a replacement but they refused and referred me to repair facility.  it's currently at the repair shop for the 2nd day. very expensive inconvenience. avoid this handset.
i love this phone and the features that come on it. my only complaint is that i am having trouble locking the screen position. outside of that, it is a really good phone.
i had the samsung galaxy s7 since 2 years ago and it was a great phone, but the battery was bad since day one. the s9 in comparison is like heaven and earth - with one charge, it last me the whole day at work and then gym. besides the battery, everything about this phone is just great. there's nothing negative (as yet) i can say about this phone.
i feel like i downgraded when i started using the phone. bigsby is probably the most insignificant a.i. i had ever used. i dislike a.i., because i see no benefit in it. humans are already lazy enough as it is, and now this. let me (a.i.) learn everything about what you do every single day so i can help you make you day more manageable 👿. disabled that thing and there's a stupid button on the side that literally stops everything and makes that piece of human insignificance design turn on and take over. please stop the a.i. bullshit and give me a phone that is actually upgarded internally as it is externally. it's really sad to see u.s.a. really bottlenecking cell phone, food, drinks, clothes, cars, and even little simple every day use items. because if it's not american it shouldn't be in america, americans are funny.
no me agrada
i was very excited to receive this phone, a long overdue upgrade from my previous one. when it finally arrived i took it to verizon to have a new sim card put in and was shocked when my account was flagged for fraud. after some calls from the sales associate to various other deparments we learned that the phone i purchased was in fact a stolen product, purchased from a store and resold as new on amazon with no payments made. it's useless, no sim card will ever work with it because the device itself has been registered as stolen on verizon's network.
screen, camera, and battery are incredible and the headphones that come with it are pretty decent. if you have big hands, it's kind of hard not to accidentally hit buttons since the screen is the whole phone but that's a minor complaint.
way better than we expected. we considered purchasing iphone x instead and am so glad we went with the s9 plus!
love the phone and only reason for 3 stars is verizon wont cover insurance for some reason. had to use a 3rd party to get coverage
i bought this mobile last week thinking it is a new one but it's not. it is a refurbished piece. the performance is not good. i'm very disappointed with my purchase.
back in march, i switched from an lg v20 to the s9+ because the screen on my lg began to bleed through. big mistake. the samsung pales in comparison to the lg. there's no tap or knock to wake option, the fingerprint sensor is finicky, scrolling through social media is a chore and i found myself growing more and more aggravated with daily use. in short, i paid the phone off early. when i was in the store explaining at how dissatisfied i was with the phone, a samsung representative was present.  upon overhearing my gripes, he just said something about not pleasing everyone. while that's true and there is no perfect phone, samsung sure has some catching up to do with lg.  much better user interface on lg and the fingerprint sensor isn't as finicky.  do yourself a favor and check out the v30 or the g7.  skip the s9+
great phone. switched from a iphone. bought from at&t
my daughter bought  this phone, a new one and we took it  to metro pcs to active it. its was impossible cause it's showing  that its looked. so i was able  to use it. hope i will have a refund or find a better solution to this problem. feeling frustrated.. money lost.
battery stop working good as 4 month of use.
i bought a galaxy s9+ which these days is samsung's flagship phone. i was stupefied to find that sidesync doesn't support the s9 family...i then tryied samsung flow but i cannot used it either as windows pin login is not available on my windows 10 enterprise notebook.shame you samsung, i regret my buy...
s9 fantastic business phine using daily is a pc and a phone great phone!
greatest phone ever...cant put it downlove the color
i have had nothing but trouble with this phone.  it turns off and on on its own, i can't get data to work half the time, it's slow and i want a refund or an exchange.  but i can't get amazon to help me.  i paid $900 for a paper weight.
had the iphone xs for 2 weeks. returned it because i thought 1k was too much. got the galaxy s9 plus for 250 less. i love it. the resolution is amazing. fast, smooth. i found there isn't really anything the iphone can do that the s9+ can't, but there were a lot of things the s9+ could do that iphone couldn't. why people pay more to get less phone is beyond me. . usb-c... headphone jack, the resolution, nfc! great phone, no regret. using the $250, i got the samsung galaxy watch...win.
just opened the box a half hour ago, the phone is brand new. i brought the phone for my boyfriend’s birthday and this is the cheapest i’ve seen the phone after searching for a week. i chose the 2 day delivery which was pricey but worth it because it came a whole day early. i didn’t use the phone yet but i did  turn the phone on and it sounds good and looks good!
i was concerned it wouldn't work with verizon based on some reviews...they were wrong and i am sooo very happy with my awesome prime day deal on this fast and fun phone.  slipped in my sim card, did the samsung switch app and was good to go!
bought a new phone got a phone that had been opened and had parts missing do not want!!!!
this phone has everything you need!
recently upgraded from the s7 to the s9+ and i'm terribly disappointed. last week, i decided to upgrade from a samsung s7 to a samsung s9+. i even went all in with the bogo deal from verizon and upgraded junior at the same time.rarely have i been so disappointed in a tech purchase! and samsung, i hope you have people watching for this sort of post. i'll be returning. this. phone. tomorrow. major shortcomings include ""bixby,"" microphone placement, and voice recognition.first, the ""bixby"" personal assistant is a train wreck. i don't know who decided that an unholy union of the yahoo! home page and google assistant was a good idea, but they seriously missed the mark. and it can't. be. disabled. nothing enrages me more than software bundles that can't be disabled.second, you have to hold the phone in your hand to be able to talk on the speakerphone, or the microphone is muffled and useless. seriously, samsung?! the whole point of the speakerphone function is to be able to put the phone down.thirdly--and this is the deal killer for me--the voice recognition for talk-to-text, voice dialing, and talk-to-email is just abysmal. these features worked nearly flawlessly on my s7, but on the s9+ i'm flying into daily rages over the garbled nonsense the phone ""hears"" when i talk to it. i have no accent and enunciate very clearly and it does no good. even if i shout single words and go completely over the top on my enunciation, i can't send a single text message of the simplest imaginable words. i spend 50-60 hours per week driving and must be able to communicate hands free as much as technologically possible.swing and a resounding miss, samsung.
purchase as a gift for friend, she likes it and that’s all i know about it..
perfect.
bought this for a friend of mine. i only got the best positive feedback.
el productoo no me ha llegadooo, salee negocioo cerradoo,
hi, i've got from tmobile as an ""upgrade"" for my s7 which i still have , no issues for 2 years .this one dropped once from a  low distance in a week after i bought it and cracked on the back!!! before you invest huge amount of money into this kind of junk check more appropriate options, unless you're really careful do not recommend this phone
there is no phone in the box.
what were they thinking when they designed a cell with a raised glass screen? my pure gear cover simply cracked from the strain in less than a month.
great phone below market price. phone is truly unlocked unlike what other sellers claim. everything works just as good as a new one from verizon but 200 dollars less
try this.... record about 10 different videos in different areas with everything set to auto and resolution 1080/60 fps. now transfer the files to your pc and look at the captured frame rates. right click--> properties--> details--> frame rate. you will see that each video probably has a different recorded frame rate. if you really want to see the camera fail, take it out to a trail in the woods and film there. i guarantee you it won't record at 60fps, but instead something like 51fps! hoping there's a software update for the camera soon.
low battery life
not worth it. i'm on my third galaxy s9. many issues. had galaxy phones for past 7 years. this will be my last.
battery life is just like very other phone not great but not bad either
excelente producto y atención.
después de un retraso el celular llego en buen estado y con todos los accesorios comprados. muy buen producto.
turns out to be a sprint phone
excelente, rápido envío y tal como se describe.
love the phone it just can get scratched easily but you can just put a case on it. this phone is for you!!
for some reason, my battery is not good. not sure if it isn't the original one, but it is not working good at all.
i just bought this phone and everything is soooo amazing. it's worth every single penny. :d i have a lilac purple s9+ and i absolutely love it.
so far so good.  only had for a couple of months.
phone is a pos
love it.
product arrived very fast and works great. i am very satisfied.
i bought it on march and it still the best in my opinion
definitely a great buy!!
very pleased with good service.
i really disappointed. i used to have i phone 7s plus it falls down and the front back camera no longer. i called apple support they told my it will cost $385 for repairi decided to switch to android and i bought galaxy s9 plus from amazon and i found out it is way behind compare to my i phone 7 plusfirst thing the shape long and thin and i am doubt this screen is 6,2second thing the picture doesn't have more features like i phone 7, ( live picture)third thing you can't move the screen by swipe with your fingerthis just compares to my i phone 7 plus i don't know how i phone 8 and x could be, they should be more advanced than i phone 7
the s9 is a beast!  intuitive with great features, i'm very happy with my purchase.
big upgrade from the s6 edge +. unlocked works on every carrier. cdma or gsm.
it's an s9+ unlocked smartphone.
better than ip x
ok so what an amazing phone and yet even with a good case the screen has broken twice. $ 400 to repair. could have bought something else with that money.  the curb is killing me. time to leave samsung until they can make one with a non curbed screen.
perfect perfect ,,, the only one issue is the battery of it was 4000 ma
they had a chance to fix all the laggy, unusable “features”. another forced bixby (it insists upon itself). i have both this and the iphone x. surprise, guess which one just works out of the box (spoiler alert: iphone). i was so excited about this phone, but it has maybe a (marginally) better camera setup than the s8+. it’s at least as laggy as the last phone. it’s not worth the price, flagship or not. if you’re os agnostic, get an iphone. this is way more trouble than it’s worth. it arrives bloated and you can do nothing about it.also, in typical android fashion, you get a less and less responsive device as time goes on. every app you install makes the phone that much slower. this is an android problem, same thing happens on the pixel 2 xl. i should have stuck with the pixel which is uglier, but not full of bloat.it has a nice screen though, but i like the iphone’s screen as much. this is hardly an upgrade, but another disappointment from samsung. maybe it’ll catch fire like the note and i’ll be able to be rid of this phone.
this phone surpasses any iphone currently and previously on the market. i bought it as a second phone just to use for posting pictures for my real estate business. i would take it over ios any day if it wasn't for the battery life. you would have more luck using a sidekick from 2005 plugged into a potato to hold a better charge than this phone. the note 7 (which i also owned) blew up and this one just dies after 30 minutes of use. if you can charge it for three hours to use the camera it a great.. other than that you get a ""battery too low to use flash"" message. after missing tens of important business calls and overall not being able to use the device due to its 45 minute battery life i am switching fully back to iphone.
with use of a case, the phone cannot sustain a fall of 42 inches. the glass will crack.if you don't want to pay for half the phone to fix small cracks, you can try repairing it yourself and break all internal components, when you fail, samsung will refuse to repair it, even though you are offering them money.so, if you have a 100% chance of not dropping the phone...
update: well, i've had my s9 plus for almost 2 mths now & i see it more every day! it's so fast compared to my other phone! i'm really glad i took the plunge & ordered this phone.i was really nervous about ordering this phone after reading the reviews, but after receiving it, i'm so glad i ordered from amazon. i didn't order from a third party seller. the phone came packaged in a huge box surrounded by air pockets plastic. everything was sealed and looked brand new. still, the first thing i did was contact samsung to verify that this was a new phone with a valid 1 yr warranty. they assured me that it was indeed new and had a 1 year manufacturers warranty. when i tried signing up for prepaid service, the imei number only worked with verizon. after chatting with the sales reps online, he assured me that wifi calling would work. i was doubtful after reading multiple reviews online, but figured i'd it didn't, i could go with t-mobile next month. i called samsung again after signing up with verizon and the rep at samsung said my phone was unlocked & would have worked with any carrier. yesterday, when i got my verizon sim card & put it in, no wifi calling. i checked again in a couple minutes & boom! i had all kinds of features that weren't in my phone before including wifi calling and hd calling. so happy with this phone. it's lightening fast, the screen is brilliantly beautiful & the pics it takes are unmatched. plus, no unnecessary apps that i had on my galaxy s7 edge from at&t. love this phone.
samsung makes the best displays on the market, and i love almost everything about this phone... except the display.  the picture quality is excellent, but these curved edges and rounded display corners have got to go.regarding the curved edges - they have no functional propose that couldn't be achieved with a flat screen.  no matter how you hold the phone you'll get glare at one edges or the other.  images and text message the edge get distorted.  on-screen buttons at the edge are problematic at best.  the curved edges make it virtually impossible for a case to properly protect the phone if dropped.the rounded display corners are ridiculous.  in many apps it really makes no difference, but in some there's just content you can't see.  ironically, the claimed display size of 5.8"" is measured as if the corners were not rounded.the fingerprint sensor placement is poor (though common).  if the phone is face up on a table i must pick it up to unlock it (or position my face directly above the screen for other biometrics).everything else is great: performance, responsiveness, display quality, battery life - all the things you'd normally expect from a flagship device.  but these other bizarre design choices are baffling.
my last phone samsung galaxy note 2 lasted more than 4 years and it is still working but some apps wont work on it so i had to upgrade to a new one.  new s9 is beautiful. miss my pen but new pen one is ridiculously huge so i went for s9 without pen. beautiful, smaller size, weight phone. i had extra money to spend, so i bought this one unlocked. unlocked is the way to go, so when i am out of country(usa) i can buy another chip and put it on it. plus there are no carrier specific spams on it. it is faster since my note 2 was ageing and slowed down. else there is not much they can put on it. camera results are amazing. music, i find no difference. i hope this is the last of the smartphone, since they cannot find more to put on a smartphone that will hook falks on it.
i wanted this phone a year ago! finally got it! but was undecided after receiving it whether or not to keep it because of the newer s10 that was going to be released. i just love this lilac color! it is a well needed upgrade! my old phone had only 16 gb, i had to constantly delete the few apps installed just to get another one. with this s9 worries no more for it is 128 gb! i love the quick smooth response! i was able to update too!  i was also able to use a case i bought for it thats not available for the s10e yet. (they have all the cool cases on ebay.)  i knew of the s10 & plus but not of the s10e, oh well, my bad....after playing with the s9 i just couldn't send it back....i think this s9 is just as great so far. good sound, picture, etc...works for my needs thus far!
we received the international model of this phone after purchasing two from amazon, supposedly unlocked. i was on the phone 2+ hours between amazon, samsung, and total wireless (our service provider, uses verizon network) figuring out why the phone wasn't working properly. the iemi numbers were not clean. the phones could make calls but the 4g data was not working because they could not be fully registered. the samsung rep said that the phones are an international version and the total wireless rep said they will not work on their network. now i have to return these phones. what a waste of time. i'm so frustrated!
i love samsung phones but not this one. i upgraded from a galaxy 6 to the 9. it has so many issues that i just went back to my 6. positive: transferring everything from my 6 to the 9 was easy peasy. this phone has an incredible battery life even when i play games on it several times a day. that's about the only thing i really like about the phone. the thing i noticed the very first day was the picture quality was blurry on all my photos that i took. that's the main thing i use the phone for. i tried several settings, but photo quality still remains to be an issue.for the first few weeks, my phone would actually show me notifications as to when i had emails, but then that just stopped. i checked every setting and even turned on the sound for the emails. nothing. i did the 7 ""fixes"" suggested to fix this including downloading different launchers, and doing a reboot of the phone (several times). nothing. i need to absolutely need to know when i have emails especially now that i'm taking classes again. even if it did show a notification, if i opend the email app, it would delete the notfication. this wans't a problem to keep something in notification status on the 6. fingerprint scanner doesn't work majority of the time. i just look like some idiot stroking my phone. creepy. haha. in addition to about 15 other issues listed about this phone, my app that unlocks my house when i arrive stopped working. tried everything to fix that. nothing. i thought it was the app. but the minute i switched back to my 6, the app started working again. so, now i believe it's because of the 9. this has been the worse phone i have ever had. i would not recommend this phone to anyone!
the phone does every great, except the actual phone part is horrible.  i’m probably going to return it.  calls drop every day.  it won’t dial out unless i restart it.  this happens whether the call is wifi or via the carrier.  this did not happen with my last 6 phones.  same carrier for last 6 phones, but this ""flagship"" is a pos with a capital ""s"".  in addition, it does not hold its value.  it’s unbelievable to me that a oneplus will sell on ebay for 95% of its purchase price every 6 months when the new version arrives.  but i bought this on cyber monday for $547 plus tax with a normal price of $899 and it’s selling on ebay in the 400s!  that’s ridiculous drop in value compared to oneplus.  my biggest complaint is failure to dial out.  i’ve tried rebooting.  i’ve tried resetting everything.  i’ve called my carrier.  while the camera is exceptional, it fails at being a phone!!!!!!  update jan 24, 2019 - i received a replacement.  the replacement had the same defects as the original, plus the volume from speakers was lower.  it is unworthy to be called a flagship.  it looks nice.  it has a nice screen.  it has a terrific camera.  it is a lousy phone - it’s main function.  it is filled with samsung bloatware.  and the predictive swipe texting on both phones was the worst at predicting words of any phone i’ve ever owned.  the keyboard sucks in swipe mode.  horrible.  i’m going to oneplus (no bloatware) or apple (security and just great products).
before receiving my phone i received an email from reliant cellular (the seller) giving me instructions on how to resolve an issues should any arise. this made me feel good about the purchase because i got the info to quickly get help in the case i need any.the phone i ordered was as described, new, and perfect. i easily took the sim card out of my old phone (i used a pay as you go phone plan through simple mobile) inserted it and started using it. i will be switching plans because my carrier just doesn't cover enough areas that i tend to travel, but when i do switch, again i will be able to just swap out the sim and continue where i left off. i was initially concerned during start up that it wasn't unlocked due to a ton of mentions and programs for verizon, but it is unlocked.my battery lasts me all day, unless my kids are watching endless videos. the screen and picture/ video quality is amazing! i'm so happy with this phone!! i'm still finding different things to play around with and personalizing my phone and i've had it for a week.
before i start i need to say that i came from a windows 10 phone and a flawless working mobile platform. however, after a long time using windows phone it's clear that a android phone is quite a shock, because everything is on your shoulders to get it customized/optimized. regardless of this, my biggest contra is on battery life. this is unbelievable, max 12-14hr if you use wifi, this is not top. my last alcatel idol 4s windows phone last forever comparing to samsung galaxy s9+. the good thing is, you can customize and make it more ""microsoft like"", microsoft applications including office, onedrive, cortana and outlook do not come preinstalled, but when you can personalize the device with microsoft's productivity applications so every customer is able to work, play and connect on their device when they leave. the design is nice, the camera pretty awesome, took some test photo's and they look great. to install everything and import stuff such as text and/or mms messages take time (and additional tools). without customization the default installation made the phone super ""wordi"", just sending from every app messages etc. so, i recommend to check this first to fulfill your needs. the screen is stunning, clear picture. and it's good to see, samsung is catching up with former microsoft hello technology to have fingerprint, iris, face recognition. thats a very good feature which is also used in additional apps such as banking. i'm also concerned about ip68 (water protection) because there is no rubber seal protecting the sim and micro sd card from water. bottom line: battery life is for me the absolute negative point, therefore 3 stars
i was so excited to get my new phone... i opened the amazon box(in tact) to find a samsung galaxy s9 box. the outer sleeve of the box was dented and ripped. first i was disappointed because i did not order a used phone, i ordered a new phone and expected a new looking box. i then took the sleeve off and finished opening the box only to find that there was no phone in the box at all, no phone, no charger, no nothing!!!!! i am so disappointed and furious i could scream. i spent a lot of money on the phone. i called amazon and the woman told me there was nothing they could do. she told me that they needed to start a 3 day investigation. no reassurance, nothing. they told me to call them back in 3 days. i am guessing they have some internal theft going on?? not sure what else it would be. i order from amazon all the time. i rarely have an issue, but this makes me rethink ordering from amazon, or online at all. has anyone else had something like this happen???
way too much for a chinese cell phone. there's others with the same specs.
not fair to spend like 5 - 7 more dollars, and right after the purchase the price drops.the item itself is ok.

why is that me samsung galaxy s9+,doesn't have a samsung headphone, instead a different name on it?
nothin phone was broke when it arrived
i just got this phone through my work. i've owned the galaxy 4,5, and 7, so i figured i'd stay with the same brand and get the s9. i've had it only a few days, and the screen is so unresponsive when clicking and scrolling and apps are spontaneously shutting down.i do love the creativity behind this and camera features, but getting the darn thing to work is quite frustrating.
plug garbage. can't use any normal android. plug. would not have bought. returning to these dopes
ok, i looked at my old s6 and decided it was time for a new phone, the s9 has better security,a slot to expand memory, newer camera and a bixby assistant if your to lazy to press app. what it doesn't have is an ir blaster so i can use it as a remote. the upgrades i didn't needare there, the one additional item i liked they removed. this is an expensive downgrade for me.
i recieved the wrong color. :(
i am completely perplexed that this thing has such bad notifications.i use lg, pixel and iphone, saw it all, and had reasons to abandon samsung long time ago. every cheap lg just worked better than samsung for me.decided to try s9  due it's small size; the only other option was google pixel but its display is just too bad. the only thing worse than the display are those large bezels, and the need to find and install some 3rd party apps that would allow to auto-hide the soft buttons, when you want to get more out of that abysmal display. heck, except in youtube, the buttons are always  there, making that 5"" screen more like 4.5"", in a body that's wider than s9. what a nonsense..anyway, s9 notifications:no notifications on locked screen:  i have to take it, unlock, swipe down (needs both hands) and then i'll see notifications. iphone/pixel/nexus turns on the screen for a few seconds, i can see if it's anything interesting, if not i go with my work, the phone turns off the screen.limited notifications on locked screen:shows two lines vs full screen + scroll on iphone. some settings available that don't help much. androids in general are not that good as iphone, as they always are trying to bundle notifications. if you try to avoid that, at least they'll be bundled by the app.raise to wakeup and show notifications:with iphone/pixel/nexus, i would pickup the phone and the accelerometar would wake up the phone, showing  notifications. as soon as i put the phone down the screen goes off. when i pickup s9 nothing happens - again unlock and swipe procedure...notifications while using the phone:some message comes in, the phone does nothing. sometimes it vibrates, sometimes it sounds, and sometimes it does show the popup.all this regardless of notification sounds settings and silent mode. wtf ?app icon number:not reliably cleared or set on google inbox, outlook, google play, to name a few.note: some of these problems are tied to notification sound being off. so, they tied together sound and visual part of the notification system. maybe that's good, but it's them who tried to distinguish between visual and sound notifications in  settings. naturally, these certainly are two different things as their use model is different.  samsung knows that but they failed to get it right. it's understandable why they failed - read below about the sw update i got.  anyway, sometimes some things work for a while (e.g. after i change different options) but then get broken again. classical samsung...all in all, i am relying on my pebble to show me notifications.some 3rd party apps allow coping with most of these problems but they are unreliable, sometimes power hungry or not persistent. so why samsung doesn't care ?  well, just two days into preorder (i already got my phone) and i get software update with important bug fixes. so, these guys are trying to deliver the software with zillion options so naturally it's not yet ready and is full of bugs. they start lots of things, and  rarely nail a single one.first crazy option: edge screen notifications. you got to check out that hopeless attempt to implement ... ...i don't know what.second crazy  option: turn on screensaver when screen is off. it's screen **saver** for a turned off screen ? wtf ?third crazy option: always on screen showing me the clock (duh) and that i have notifications... sure i do! i receive about hundred or more different notifications daily. the phone is always in front of my face when working and driving - show me the notification, not an icon saying there's one...fourth crazy option: you can enable vibration when you pickup the phone, if there was some notification. duh, what about showing that notification.i was thinking working hard getting different 3rd party apps until i fix the notifications to suit my needs. but still, that would leave me with the curved screen;  curved screen means there are no cases that allow comfortable grip as the case cannot extend fully above the lcd. i find much larger phones more comfortable in my hand - e.g. samsung's own s8 active, pixel 2 xl with a proper case are easier to handle. so, my argument that i should get s9 because it's the smallest premium phone doesn't apply anymore.in addition, curved glass easily breaks as the glass is exposed. so many broken s8 phones around. i hear they've put much better **glass** into s9.  duh..and not to forget the screen protector - there are no good glass screen protectors on the market (yet). i don't know what's wrong but glass protectors requires you to increase the screen sensitivity in the phone settings. well, that option doesn't work good. i type fast and often use my phone for work email. i can't go and repeat every other letter. also, glass screen protector, as of today, don't cover the full screen. in fact, they have some glue on the sides for the better grip, actually covering the whole curved edge.all in all, i am returning this one, and will wait to see what lg g7 will look like. otherwise, will wait for pixel 3. until then, iphone 7, with all it's problems, is still a better deal for me than s9.some notable positive sides:samsung internet browser is just awesome.lcd is excellent. even better after apple forcefully reduced the lcd brightness on iphone 7-,  to ""help"" aged batteries. don't know about iphone x, should be also close to 700nits like this one.starting camera with double click to power button.photos *with flash* in dim conditions are ages ahead of the iphone.home button is there - just press glass a bit harder.speakerphone is much louder than iphone 7.---------------------------------------------------------update on screen wake-up on notification:googled a bit to see what can be done. apparently, people mention that samsung differs from ios and stock android in that you should depend on edge light, led light, vibration, sound, but not screen wake-up. so, samsung tried to be more clever than google or apple. lets see if they succeeded; i google a bit more and there are posts going back to 2015 about different issues:1. some people actually  like that there are no screen wakeup on notifications. but their screen is waking up ! s6, s7, s8, s9. people suggested lots of thing but nothing helped those poor souls.2. some people are like me and would want notification - just can't get them.3. some people argue why would somebody want to be in group 2. duh, what a bunch of schmucks - that should be a configurable option, to satisfy both groups, and no discussion needed.3. some screenshots show a very promising option in the security settings  - ""wake up screen on notifications"". well, that seems like it, except that i don't have such option.4. there are reports on all kind of apps that will screw up the notifications. while googling, a verizon help page for s9 came up, showing that the screen will not turn on when... outlook is installed. aaaargh. i need that one for work. anyway, after removing it and after doing the factory reset its still the same for me.i am reducing this to one star due to so many bugs. started with notifications, but i don't know what else is there...
i switched from the lg v30 to this model because i wanted something smaller. it is more comfortable, lighter.picture quality is way better from both cameras hands down. the phone picks fingerprints easily but not bad. screen is brighter and it gets dimmer.samsung pay is a plus.  android pie update available.  looks like samsung is faster than lg when it comes to updates.phone lags a but when closing applications  on the new android pie with the new one ui. the fingerprint sensor is really fast and the sound is better when using the phone speakers more immersive since the v30 only has a bottom speakerbattery i haven't test long enough.
great product best phone i've had
puchased this phone on pre-order back in march and have been using it since the day i received it on sprint. i was hesitant to purchase a phone outside of a sprint store but it worked out well and there was only one hiccup in activating it. this phone does not come with a sim, which apparently sprint doesn't always carry in the store. after some searching a sim was located and the associate switched my phones (s8 to s9) in about 10 minutes.
i bought this phone brand new from amazon... it was very clearly used.  the phone had been set to spanish (us) and already had a folder labeled ""applicacions de microsoft"" on it and the message app spelling dictionary only had the option for spanish (us).  cant trust anyone these days.  on the bright side they included a phone case for free lol! thanks who ever sent me this phone i appreciate that.it is a sm-g9650 (snapdragon 845) cpu but because of that its region is set for china ... not the usa.  so mine didn't come with the ability to do some stuff (wifi calling for example) that you would expect from a new phone.the phone itself is awesome.  i have large hands and its just a little too big to use with one hand for me which is its only drawback.  most normal people would use it with 2 hands but i have to be different.the picture quality is great even when capturing action shots (tried to sneak a pic of my girlfriend but she moved and i made an ugly face for half a second... the picture is so clear its like we planned for her to do that face for the picture).it works with the samsung qi certified fast charge wireless charging convertible stand/pad and does fast charge on it.coming from an iphone 4 this thing is night and day difference but i bet you could say that about any new phone.when i  open apps they open immediately.  browsing the web and watching youtube videos is smooth and uninterrupted... on my old iphone the youtube app would lock up after an hour or so of use.  plus i can download apps again lol!  my old phone was so old it wouldnt get ios updates and its level of ios isnt supported by anything so i couldnt even get my email with it anymore!i did discover one thing that i don't like about it over the iphone.... you cant turn off apps from being able to use mobile data in the foreground (you can turn off background usage).  so if you are on data and you open up youtube or 9gag and start using it its using your data.  on an iphone if you go into your cellular data section of your settings and turn an app off it will not be allowed to ever use any mobile data unless you go back in and turn that back on.  really saves you from using data when you have a wifi connection available but not connected for whatever reason and you start browsing the web.
if you don't mind losing features from your carrier get an unlocked phone. this phone is not programmed with any carriers software. i have lost 5 or 6 options i need with att. att tells me there is nothing i can do and they cannot flash or install their software. my only option is to buy a new phone, unlocked directly from att. this phone is a waste of money and had i known all this prior to buying it, i would not have bought it.
just upgraded due to a stellar cyber monday sale. the phone was just $519 with a free amazon show included. what an upgrade from the s5. i love my old phone. it still works just like it did from day one. but  this.....samsung s9 is by far a better phone than any iphone out there. the screen is bigger crystal clear display. lots of cool new features in emojis and apps that my s5 didn't have access to. battery life is phenomenal! the sound is better then any phone i have used. the curved edges give the screen the largest view. the camera seems very good. still learning some of the new features.  i have no idea about some of these reviews, mine came in a sealed box brand, i called samsung they thanked me for being a loyal customer and said it comes with a two year warranty. i did buy a case and a screen protector. thank you amazon for the great deal! (will work with t mobile, boost, red pocket and att. ) as a precaution call your provider before you order :)  heads up this will not work with sprint they do not accept any unlocked androids. kind of a hassle, so i switched providers.
i received the phone and when i opened i realised the package has been previously opened and resealed.  everything was in the box but no device to open sim card holder and no paperwork  it says us warranty but that is a lie there is absolutely no paperwork.  i have activated the phone and it appears to be working i will write a next review one month in to let you know how it goes.
i bought the samsung galaxy s9 like new from amazon warehouse deals and not an authorized seller. i wanted an extra $50 off cause someone touched the phone but then returned it. i work in education; i'll take any deal i can get. i also made sure the phone came with original packaging (it was stated in the condition description).so far, i am very pleased with this purchase. the phone is lovely. it came with the plastic still on and all the original pieces such as headphones and the little tools for popping out the sim card. it does not come with a charger so i picked some up in a separate order.i have at&t. getting my service sorted was a bit tricky but it is set up and everything is working now. i went to one store and the agent switched the sim card and checked calling service but not my data. i left, i shopped, and then suddenly realized that my internet wasn't working. went to another store but the agents were useless and only wanted to sell me stuff that was irrelevant to my issue. so it goes. i went home and called at&t. three agents and an hour later i rolled a yahtzee and mark the advanced tech guru came on the phone. we did a bunch of stuff on the phone having to do with my imei and apn. neither immediately worked. finally, he had me hang up and turn my phone off so he could ""zap it."" he called me back after, cause that's the kind of class act mark is. huzzah! my mobile data was working without issue.one disadvantage of buying the phone like new is that the warranty was started by the person who first bought it. it does not say anywhere in the amazon description when the phone was first purchased. i registered the phone with my samsung account and it shows that the warranty started in june. i am therefore assuming that's when the first owner registered it. it is beginning of dec. now. if i anticipated really using the warranty (i don't) i might find this annoying.i'll also point out that i bought this phone with my discover during an amazon cashback quarter. the 5% cashback covered my state tax. this saved me an extra $30 that i put toward a microsd card for more storage.if anything goes wrong with this phone, i will update in the future. so far, i am tickled lilac with my like new amazon warehouse deals phone.
too expensive to have such a short life. this s9 was my 2nd expensive phone purchased in amazon. first i bought s7 refurbished. horrible idea! had a short life of maybe 7 months. second time i purchased this s9 less than a year ago, priced around $800.00usd - phone was good, but it started to get slow to reinitiate plus last time it was updating over night, it simply never came back to life. too expensive for such a short life. will not buy any more cell phones in amazon. i went straight back to best buys to get some insurance, warranty and anything possible.
i have not had many issues with this phone thus far. i always keep it in battery saver mode which can be frustrating for lack of certain notifications, but it seems to be fast, the size isn't too big for me, although one handed operation is limited compared to the smaller phone. charge lasts all day without much use without power saver mode. add a fair amount of use and power saver mode and still lasts all day.i couldn't justify getting a gs9 over a gs9+ because the battery life is better, 2 cameras, and an extra 2 gb of ram over the other device. i like this one for these extra features. samsung made a quality phone, and i am happy to own it. i'd recommend charging the battery up to 85%, and keeping it above 35%, which may double your battery life (maintian 95% capacity after 4 years instead of samsung's 2 year guarantee)
it was waiting for me when i got home, and it's perfect. everything is in the box as it should be, all wrapped in cling plastic and brand new. i've only had the phone for a few hours now so i can't make any claims about how well it works, but it's definitely new. some of the reviews had made me nervous but it isn't scratched, used, or missing all together. it even has the smartswitch paperwork, user guide, health warnings, and extra ear bud caps (still sealed). my only complaint isn't with the phone, but with the delivery person. they left it in my back yard for some reason, so my dog chewed into the cardboard amazon box and put some deep gouges in the external s9 sleeve. but nothing important was damaged.
what a great phone. sansung has done a great job of updating thetr android os and this thing is beautiful. fast, great screen, and has sd card capability. this was part of a promotion carried by samsung and alsk by amazon. it included a free samsung ""chromebook"" which has turned out to be my goto tablet/laptop. crazy, huh? very happy with phone connection, messaging and every thing else.
everything about this phone is traffic!
i have instagram and a youtube page and would love to promote this product
based upon product details, questions and answers, etc was led to believe that this unlocked samsung s9 would work in verizon. however, it does not. bought this s9 in prime day and received several other items as part of the bundle. now i have no phone and will have to pay a much higher rate because i waited for 'prime day' to purchase. very disappointed.
absolutely worthy phone
its perfect
satisfied
****update 1/14/19****my original review for the phone is below. i have owned this for 1 month and found my phone would not update to the latest firmware, it kept saying it was up to date from july 2018 even though samsungs website showed monthly updates. i contacted samsung, provided the imei number for the phone and found it was factory locked to a specific carrier (not mine and not the one seller said it was unlocked for.) i contacted that carrier and found it was unpaid by the owner and would be locked until that person paid it off, the imei was held against the original owners social security number due to the unpaid balance and they told me to return the phone, the seller was committing a form of fraud by selling me that phone. i would always suggest contacting samsung with the imei number to verify it is fully unlocked before putting all of your info into the new phone.***original review****there are only 2-3 downfalls i have found with this phone and one related to the seller, i bought a refurbished phone and it still had the old phone number registered to it which is a fault on the seller, but also a caution to anyone buying refurbished.the other ""downfalls"" are related to the curved edge screen. it is impossible to find a case that protects the screen on all sides due to this. i have found multiple cases that are raised on the top and bottom keeping the screen off tabletops when face down however the sides are still exposed. the other is i can see a slight flicker on the sides if i turn the phone slightly, this may or may not be with every phone or just mine since it was refurbished.now onto the good!the speaker quality feels like the phone is it's own handheld movie theater. the color is extraordinary. battery life has been better than my previous s7 but not as good as i was expecting for a model 2 years newer and the plus version. response time is impeccable. there is bass with the sound. no lagging whatsoever. highly recommend the phone just note the curved edges are exposed and that part makes me nervous.
first off, the a##hold carrier that delivered it left it on the front porch in the freaking snow and ice- so i was not happy about that at all.  i am frankly sick to death of the delivery people amazon uses, and their delivery promises that aren't kept.  delivery was promised sunday but i didn't get it until today.  i watched up until 8:00 last night when i got an email stating that it would be delivered today by 8 p.m. instead of yesterday by 8 p.m.the phone appears to be new, but i have no idea how to tell.  it looks new, is spotless and my daughter loves it (so far).  i will update my evaluation as time goes on.
this is so much better than my note 4, not that i didn't like the 4. the one thing i didn't notice until actually getting the s9+ is that the security control by knox is within the s9+. i think i read this is a preferred requirement by businesses now for their enterprise cell phones for employees. could be a very good thing for all of us. it does require me to play with it more to find out how i need to ""tailor"" it to settings i prefer so it is easier for me personally. but hey, i love discovering new things anyway. the screen is beautiful for my midnight black version of my s9+, the responsiveness is fantastic and memory space is oh so much better. and buying it unlocked? i find that to be the one thing i didn't expect to be outstanding. i hope and plan this to last me a long long time.
i have a galaxy s7 that i love.  despite being big, it feels nice in my hand and is easy to use.  the s9 with its curved edges was infuriating to use.  my palm kept hitting the side of the screen when i reached across the phone.and i really don't get the point of the curved edge.  it doesn't do anything useful i care about, it just makes it hard to use.  i think samsung decided they had to do something interesting and different to give it a ""wow"" factor, despite it being worse than useless.so my brother says you can get a big case to cover up the edges to solve the problem.  ok, but if the solution is to just cover the edges up, what's the point of having it in the first place???and it's super tall.  which i also don't understand.  it makes it hard for my thumb to reach the top of the phone.i feel like samsung has fallen into the trap where their shareholders just want the stock to keep going up, so it's not enough to sell a million phones, they have to sell 2 million next quarter, so instead of making a good useful phone they are going to make a gimmicky phone to try to attract people with new gimmicks even if they're not useful.i returned the s9 after a day of use and i'm back to my s7.  i'll probably get a pixel 3 instead eventually.
i liked my samsung gs7 edge, but i *love* this phone!  the oreo android 8 update on the gs7e is pretty poky, but this phone screams!  two apps i like but could barely use on the samsung were the microsoft ""arrow"" launcher and the google ""carplay autos"" apps - painfully slow on gs7e, but on gs9+ they scream!  battery life continues to be excellent, better screen, better usb jack, better stereo sound, and also much better bluetooth (i had some devices that were really slow to properly connect on gs7e's bt4.0, but gs9+'s bt5.0 rocks so far).  i wish samsung and google were a little less heavy-handed on insistently pushing their more privacy-invasive features (like location history, etc), and i wish i could uninstall a few gb of samsung cr@pware though...
had to get a new phone, and really dislike the other options. the major drawbacks for this phone are the edge display, which is impossible to find a good screen protector for, and the fact that after recently cracking the display, i realized it costs roughly half the price of the phone to replace.  other than the price of the display and the obnoxious, and seemingly pointless beveled ""edge"", i absolutely love the camera, and the phone is very fast.  the sprint network obviously does the phone zero justice, so you may want to change service providers to benefit the the performance that this phone has to offer.
note that this review is of how the product arrived and first day thoughts, it's not in-depth of the phone long-term.contrary to what a few other customers seemed to have experienced in some reviews, my phone came completely brand new and not tampered with at all. everything worked fine from launch and all i had to do was transfer my sim and sd cards over (i use verizon, the sim works just fine, no need to contact them.) there's nothing i can see regarding damage or issues with the phone related to how it was sent or what could have happened beforehand.i bought this phone unlocked and new in order to avoid the verizon bloatware i never used but couldn't manage to get rid of. it was also nice to avoid the hidden fees attached to new phones bought through providers.my initial thoughts are: it's fantastic.the picture quality is stunning, especially coming from a droid turbo ii (which was a nice phone for what it was, but the screen is so lackluster in comparison.) the camera is beautiful and i could easily say justifies the pricepoint for those looking at the market for photography in comparison to other phones i've seen and i haven't even touched many of the features.the speakers are surprisingly clear and sound great. i've noticed a trend with many smartphones from day one to just have... awful speakers for some reason. maybe manufacturers assume you're using peripherals and bluetooth at all times. regardless, this phone covers that base better than most others.the slim and tall design feels much better in my hand than i was expecting it to, coming from a smaller phone.i love the shortcuts on this android version and just how the entire galaxy line operates in general. samsung has always made stellar leaps in convenience mixed with modernization and the s9+ is no different.as far as bixby goes: i don't use voice commands on phones, whether it be bixby, google assistant, etc., period. i just avoid the bixby button (my one caveat with this phone is part of the hardware being designed exclusively for bixby) so it doesn't apply.i will update this later regarding other things like battery life, communication features, and anything else i can think of after using it for an extended period of time.
had no trouble transferring apps from my old s4, though i did have to re-enter some passwords.  the cable connection didn't seem to work, but then it found the old phone on wifi and grabbed everything anyway.  the screen is completely eye-popping, especially after setting it to the highest resolution.  blazingly fast compared to the s4 and the battery seems to last and last.  one real annoyance (but still giving it 5 stars): it's really hard to turn off the bixby ""feature"" and it's tied to a dedicated button right under the volume control.  the button can't be used for anything else and is really easy to hit by accident.  c'mon samsung.  the people that don't want it, don't want it.  it should be a simple setting to turn it off and assign the button to something else or nothing.  magnificent device overall though.
i upgraded to this samsung s9 model sm-g960u1 unlocked version from a samsung s7.  the phone works just fine and the transfer of all my stuff from the old phone to the new went pretty well.  while the curved screen has a visual appeal i believe that a flat screen would be both more practical and easier to protect.  in terms of it being a tool, i haven't discovered anything new that this phone can do that the s7 couldn't do.  it comes with something called ""bixby"" that i guess we're supposed to all just know what it is and what to do with it... guess i'm not interested in bixby until i see some information that educates me on what it does and why i might need it... i do like samsung phones and once you've grown accustomed to a company's android interface it makes sense to stay with what is familiar.  if you have an s7 or s8 there is probably no reason to upgrade to the s9 version unless you have money burning a hole in your pocket.  in my case, one of my son's needed a phone so he got my old s7 and i treated myself to a new phone.
upgraded from a note 2... the touch sensitivity was actually better on the note... brought it back to the dealer and he said i did not close out enough. still the same. i would not recommend this phone. to me this phone is a bust.
recently got rid of my iphone 7+ and made the switch. i did this because i didn't like that apple wouldnt leave anything alone and kept updating it until it was slower and less firmilar. the iphone always worked though.  the s9+ is a constant fight to get something to work how i want it. the apps don't run nearly as smooth as they did on the iphone.  on a positive note, it's got a nice camera. this phone is a great piece of hardware with terrible software. i'm excited for my one year lease to expire so i can get another iphone.
i bought my galaxy s9 weeks ago and  the battery last less than 12hours they said is new but im not sure about it...... i want my money back!!!
the galaxy s9 is samsung's 2018 flagship phone that currently runs on android's latest version. this device is powered by qualcomm's 2018 845 processor. there is a headphone jack and a usb c port that charges the phone from 0% to 100% in 1 hour and 45 min. the phone has 3 buttons: a power button, a volume control button, and samsung bixby (voice assistant) button. one of the biggest changes from the s8 is the camera. the s9+ has a dual camera that performs well in low light. some of the camera modes include auto, video, hyperlapse, super slo-mo, and food. the camera produces amazing images and 4k 60 fps video. for unlocking the phone you can use a pin, password, pattern, fingerprint, iris, or face. the phone has wireless charging that allows you to lay the phone on a pad without plugging it in. the curved screen on this phone is phenomenal. one interesting inclusion to the phone is a heart rate monitor that is next to the camera. this can be used in the samsung health app. the phone is thin and light and has a great feel. samsung has done a great job with the s9. the s9 is a great price phone that i highly recommend.
i've had many samsung phones and liked them.  but my most recent phone was an lg v20, which i was also very happy with.  the camera glass cracked after 2 years, and i decided to get another samsung.  overall this is a great phone. i wish it was a little larger, so the same screen resolution yielded larger text and icons.  i know i can adjust it, but on the v20 everything's a bit larger at the same resolution, because the usable screen is larger. but if you have good vision at that distance it won't bother you.one complaint i have is bixby and the samsung bloatware.  i bought this unlocked so i wouldn't have the carrier bloatware, but samsung puts on plenty of their own, and along with bixby, you can't delete most of it, just disable it.  it continues to nag me to use one of the apps.  i don't know why they want to cram this down the user's throat.  i already bought the phone.  if i thought samsung had better apps, i'd download them.  but none of their built in apps are better than google stock apps or other 3rd party. i'm not sure what the reason is for trying to push their apps on users.  i guess to avoid this  you have to buy a google phone.
 smoothest samsung experience, truly the market leader for android. used xperia z2 and lg g5 each flagships of their times, paid full release amount for both phones. best experience so far. i used wave ii and samsung corby (was disappointed with both) gave samsung a chance with gear s2, got impressed hence tried s9+ refined software and redifned flaws of innovation in any successfull flagship. i didn't have it delivered but it's an awesome device!!!
when i first bought the galaxy s9 (thru xfinity mobile), i was very much impressed with its graphics, camera, and just overall sleek design. the os is very responsive and easily adaptable. and for its price, i find it to be a great quality phone. unfortunately, if i couldve done things differently, i would've bought an s8. it seems, that as a new model, there are still kinks that samsung needs to work out.the battery is very weak. it doesn't even last half a day (12 hours) with moderate use. also, the design can sometimes make the phone screen very easily crackable because of the raised edges (the phone case that i had bought could not protect the phone when it fell to the ground).
i had a galaxy s7 ans iphone 8 and purchased both a galaxy s9 and s9+ ... the camera on the samsung destroys all of apple's product offerings. that was one of the main reasons in getting the phone. i still think the apple os is far superior to android, and there are glitches galore. turned off all notifications but still can get an app or two which will notify even when do not disturb is put on. here is the odd thing, the s9 that i have seems to preform much faster and have a better camera than the s9+ on several occasions i used both and there was a huge difference in speed and pic quality. i would take the s9 over the s9+ screen seems sharper and the larger size is not worth is, horrible bixby feature! my galaxy s7 made me a samsung customer, the s9 is making the apple 8 seem more appealing and i prefer the aspect ratio of the screen on the apple. speakers are better on the galaxy. for the price through, the apple is the better phone except for the camera.
returned the item as did not get akg earplugs in the box.
the phone came without the charger. plus it gets very hot when being used
phone appears to be in mint condition. delivery was fast. however i received a sprint version of the phone wich is not compatible at all with verizon. will have to return. 10/22/18
i went for ""premium"" by getting an s9+, but am rather disappointed.  first, there's huge amounts of bloatware.  i ended up disabling over 200 packages on the device that i didn't need/want.  then, i couldn't ""root"" it.  hey, it's my device; i should be able to do whatever i want with it including putting on a custom rom.  the curved screen is actually a negative - i can't get a good screen protector for it.  finally, the s9+ screen is actually smaller than the nexus 6p i had before.  going back to a google phone next time.  i loved them in the past, and am kicking myself for changing.
lets start with the positives. it's fast, its responsive, the camera is good, ample storage and usb-c. also has a headphone jack which is sadly scarce in 2018now the negatives. the biggest one is the rounded edges of the display (and the reason why i will probably be selling this phone). they make it impossible to hold the phone with one hand, as it will always detect your palm as an imput and mess up the touch sensors. it also gives a warping effect for any video being watched, so the edges are always deformed. also this screen scratches way too easy, i have only had it since april and the screen is already scratched to the point where its intrusive. had a note 5 since launch day and it had not a single scratch on the screen, vs this which was getting scratches within a few days of getting it.now lets talk about bixby and the bixby button. bixby is a waste of space, as the original siri worked better. not to mention google assistant also is on the device, which works a lot better. now when i tried to bind google assistant to the bixby button, but this is the next issue, you can't remap the dedicated hardware button. i thought samsung would of learned from the s8 reviews, but i guess they didn't. don't worry, they made it to where you're able to ""disable the bixby button"" where basically it puts it on a 3 second press rather than a tap, and otherwise remains active.now for just some things that don't classify as ""negatives"" but i just personally don't like. the 18:9 or properly called 2:1 just seems weird, and it pushes the top buttons a little too high for convenient use i have decently large hands but still finding myself straining my thumb to hit drop down menus or open notifications. also 99% of video content is 16:9 or 21:9, making 18:9 weird for bothi also prefer the dedicated hardware buttons of the older galaxies, as you either hide them, which means in order to have a home button you need to swipe up. it is always popping up rather than having me scroll when i swipe up, which gets incredibly annoying extremely quickly. the other option is to lock the buttons to the screen, which just makes no sense, as not only do you waste battery powering them (since they are white with a light gray background), but you also get burn-in since its an oled display. also at that point whats the point in onscreen buttons, you could just have physical buttons that work better and allow front fingerprint scanners.all in all there are some very strong positives about the phone, but they get completely outweighed by the negatives imo.
i only gave 3 stars because this phone did not come with a sim card tray. it just has a gaping hole where it should be. so when i took it to verizon to get my number and info transferred to it, they couldn't do it. there wasn't one loose in the box anywhere, so it just didn't have it. i searched the many reviews for this item and i didn't see anyone else mention this problem, so maybe my phone was an anomaly for not having the sim card tray. anyways, i had to order one online and once it arrives i can get my info transferred and test out the phone.
upgraded from the s6. love it! fingerprint on back is cool and hidden home button is good too. activated verizon set up all online super easy. i bought a caseology case and screen protector. needed to change the touch screen sensitivity to make it normal (for a while it was difficult to type).
i have always been a samsung smartphone loyalist, but that ends now. it's nearly impossible to change the  artery on the s9, therefore, i will need to buy an entirely new phone in the next year or two. but that's not why i'm giving this phone (and samsung) one star. the microphone stopped working, so no one can hear me when i  call them. from what i have read, this is a major issue which samsing has failed to address. i tried all fixes to no avail, to include restoring the phone to its factory settings. very frustrating for an almost $800 phone, which is not a paperweight. samsing needs to acknowledge and remedy this software glitch.
ok, so all of the reviews mentioning verizon had me kinda worried. don't be. i have verizon, received phone, installed nano sim from old phone and signed into google, and poof everything was there without all of the verizon bloatware. no contact with verizon at all for set up. visual vm seemed to be an issue for a lot of reviewers, open the included samsung vm app and push and hold '1.' enter password the first time and then you have an app the looks and functions just like the verizon version.for a guy who grew up with the phone wired to the wall, i am still amazed at the technology advancements made. there are a lot of features on this phone, useful stuff to. just the video and sound improvements alone are awesome as compared to droid t2.first week of use and still learning some features, but very pleased. battery life is great, almost double my previous phone.i bought a combo with a chrome book, wireless car and home chargers and a case and came out $175 less than v wanted for just the phone and all of their bloatware.
moved over from an iphone 7 .if you can extract yourself from ios (easier said than done), this is a great phone.phone itself: excellent call quality. headphones are really nice and there is a headphone jack with no dongle and you don't have to use bluetooth. charges so quickly.camera: fantastic in every way.muzak: am still a little confused on the various samsung apps, esp samsung music which is so weird. listening to music/ videos is really nice on this because of the full screen and the front facing speakers.size: this is a great size ... perfect for me. i am a medium build person with medium sized hands. i did not want a phablet. this phone feels like something between an iphone 7 and 7+ for comparison. don't know how it actually compares but feels smaller than the iphone +.get a case on this thing. i am using the supcase unicorn beetle ... it's thin and grippy.
ive had galaxy phones since the s3, and this is the first disappointment.  yes it looks good and battery is good for a new phone, but the issue is it freezes waay to often.  with such available memory and new software this should not be happening now, given its happened to all my other phones once they near the 2 year mark.  this phone is 2 months old though, not happy.
my husband bought me this phone in the lilac purple color for my birthday,...it's gorgeous! i love the display and the infinity edge. for me this is a total upgrade from the s5 i've been using, i'm so glad i waited! everything shows up bright and crystal clear. even my email looks nicer!the emojis you make using the camera do turn out a bit creepy,...they look like you but not really. at my age i don't think this is something i see myself using too often in chat or messenger. it's fun for all of maybe 10 minutes.the camera is nice, the pictures come out clean and clear. however i do wish all the features were explained a bit more in the manual  to make it easier to figure out. it's nice being able to scroll through the different modes with a swipe of your finger but the how-to's on using some of the different options would be nice if they were printed out in the manual for reference. i'm sure it would be easy enough to look on youtube or google,....haha i suppose this is what happens when you go from an old phone and leap frog over a few generations and find yourself in the future. :pi'm not too crazy about bixby though, there should be a way to reassign the button to something else and remove the app entirely if you choose. i also like my camera settings set so you say ""smile"", ""shoot,"" ""cheese"", ""record video"", or another trigger word,... but unless you completely turn off the voice for bixby  you can't use the voice command on the camera. one feature should not cancel out another,... maybe there will be a software update later on.  or maybe i have completely missed the setting somewhere and will bump into it somewhere after i've used it more?the speakers are excellent, music sounds great and phone calls come through very clear. using speaker phone i actually had to turn call volume down, on my old phone it was hard to hear people talk and the mic didn't pick up very well either. not the case here!i love this phone!  it's a nice size, easy to hold, and looks great! it was also very easy to set up and after i played with it for awhile i found it simple to navigate with a few cool surprises thrown in for me to discover. having read how similar this phone is to the s8 i can understand some people being annoyed at spending all their money and not really getting much more than they already had, but i did read before these were released  that they were similar and if i had an s8 i probably would not have bought this model. for the most part i still feel this is a great phone. i know for a fact i will have a great time taking pictures and videos of my kids and grandkids with it!*3/21/18-  added a few sample pictures,  one is a  close up (approx.12"" away, begging dog wanted my lunch), another a couple inches away, and the others from about 15 feet. no filters just had the camera set to auto and let it do its thing. pictures come out clear and so much nicer than from my other phone. i've been playing with the other features as well and results are great too.using the volume button to snap a quick picture is convenient, it makes taking pictures with this size phone so much easier. i'll have a great time using this camera when the grand kids visit!the lock screen is a little annoying when you have to click the power button then do the swipe screen, but in a way it's useful, my old phone did all sorts of things on its own while tumbling around  in my bag. the hidden home button and the power button are both quick and responsive, either one quickly wakes the phone up but the home button brings up the home screen if you press it when the screen is off. you can always change the time out settings so your screen doesn't click off as fast to give you more time, so not really a big deal for me.this is a fun phone to have. battery life for me is great, i keep the display on bright because it's just so pretty. i also have the time  out screen set for 5 minutes. i just charge my phone once a day and i'm good to go! no regrets with this phone.
you know how excited you get when that package comes with your s9 in it? well it was 100% a bust. i opened it and the first thing that set me off was no charger or any of the extras. once i got the phone out of the box, it was immediately  appearant it was a fake. nothing worked. it was a child's play toy. calling amazon  was a bit interesting because they had me on hold for about 40 minutes. buyer beaware you may pay $700 for a fake. i  requested a replacement which should arrive shortly. i will video the opening  and recommend you do you just in case this happens to you. will update my review on the replacements arrival.
samsung galaxy s9+ unlocked smartphone - lilac purple - us warrantyi'll add to this review after a few weeks of use so this is mainly for sprint users.i inserted this sim which i bought on amazon because i didn't feel like messing with sprint employees this time. the sim is sprint sim simolw406tq samsung galaxy s9, samsung galaxy s9+ search the number, you'll find it. i inserted the sim and followed the activation on the phone, not the website. know your phone number and security pin before you start this and it'll go much smoother for you. it took five minutes and the phone was rocking and i never called sprint.other insights. the camera. wow. they are getting close to slr quality with these lenses. it's not the same but i'm sure i could fool some with it.overall speed, excellent.the plus is one loooong phone. still fits in my pocket just finebixby...... wth is this?that's it for now.
i paid more than $700 and all i got was an empty box!!!  not only that, but this seems to have been a reconditioned unit, or some kind of ""new old stock"", re-handled and re-labeled.  but what i really got was a box that was sealed with factory tape (or reconditioner's shop tape), all the accessory cables and connectors, but no samsung phone!!!  pay $700, get zero!!!!!
i got this phone during a cyber monday sale. considering the reduced cost and the extra amazon device included with the package this was a fantastic deal! buying from amazon also gave me a peace of mind. should something go wrong then i have a path of recourse.the phone was new, factory sealed, and unlocked. it fired up right away. getting it work with mint mobile was a little challenging but that's not the phone's fault. the camera is excellent, especially if you shoot in raw/dng format and process the image with something like capture one or lightroom. battery life is also great but i also don't use the phone 24/7 non-stop.
i recommend rs cells as seller to buy from.  i was a little nervous as to how ‘used’ it would look. but it looked new. i think it’s new! no original box or manual or anything else aside from the phone and original charger as described by seller. popped in my sim after cutting it down to size.  all my contacts were there.  all texts gone. had problem sending multimedia text message but looked online to solve problem (apn related).  i haven’t explored everything on phone yet.  so far no major problems yet, knock on wood.i’m glad i took a chance to update my old phone and buying from good seller.  paid 1/2 the price, new, win-win.
the samsung galaxy s9+ is bigger than the s9, and holds a charge very well.  the cameras take excellent photos.  am still getting used to it, different from the galaxy s5, my previous phone.  the curved edge display looks very cool.  a fast moving phone.  lovely design overall.  i got the coral blue which is a beautiful seashore blue.  the phone is a little heavier in the hand than i expected.
product is performing well, but moving photos over is a real problem.  also volume on phone is too low.  maybe this can be fixed, but so far no luck.  very disappointed with seller/amazon.  original order was canceled, not by me as reported, but by the seller/amazon.  when i finally got the phone it cost me $70 more than original order.  i have not yet fought this battle with seller/amazon.
+ camera rocks,+ i like being able to add memory cards.+ love how ell it works support tv's+ bluetooth is fairly stable+/- battery life, the manage function works, but overall i feel like it is degrading quicker than i'd like.- the auto volume annoys the crap out of me.- bixby, this is apple like arrogance having a dedicated button you cannot remap- screen has delicate edges, look great but you must use protective film, causes a loss of sensitivity.- hate kies and all samsung software for file transfer, just garbage.overall - i'd take this over the 5g  for now, it is value for money.improvements i'd like - something that has large music player control buttons for sport/driving.
nice phone. i'm still trying to learn android. a little different than my windows phone, which i loved. this phone is fast. has lots of settings to make it the way you like it. waiting for the new user interface and new android. they should be available very soon. i did a lot of research on this phone before buying. i'm not disappointed. i like bixby which i didn't think i would use but it's handy. push the bixby button and ask for help or open apps, messaging, phone, voice mail. whatever you want to use and it opens. call phone number, call voicemail, create and send this message. very quick and helpful.
i have only bought samsung phones before and this one disappointed me. first off, for some reason the screen scratches very easily. my keys were able to put some significant grooves in the screen. the battery life is worse than last year's s8 and i basically have to keep it on battery saving mode all the time. i have had the phone for almost three months now and it seems to be slowing down. it also glitches alot and some apps refuse to open. overall, for a samsung, not very impressed.
i saved a $100 by ordering this from amazon as opposed to getting it through at&t. it connected to my at&t carrier the moment we put the sim card in. the phone is beautiful. i have not had time to thoroughly explore it, but it appears to be working just fine.my phone was sitting on the table this morning and it just went dead. i called samsung support and they emailed me a next day air shipping label. they were very good about it and i have no complaints.i do not look forward to being without my phone for a week. there are no service centers in my state - delaware. i still love this phone.
i purchased this phone about 5 weeks ago. i needed something that was unlocked and that would work with at&t as my samsung galaxy note 4 finally died. the phone has worked perfectly since it arrived. it came new in box with a power cord, wall adapter, and headphones. i did have to take it in to a store to get a new micro sim card as the one in my previous phone was the larger type and did not fit in the slot. the battery life is great and the cell signal comes in with no issues.
a phone with a beautiful glass body with many great qualities. such as the use of dolby atmos for an exquisite audio experience and custom audio settings. the infinity amoled display looks immensely beautiful with vivid colors and deep black. another plus that samsung continued the use of the headphones slot. battery life is great for everyday normal use, and 5he battery saver settings provide options that greatly extend the battery life of the device. samsung pay is a very nice feature especially since it can work in more places than other digital payment methods.
buyer beware. unlocked phones do not support some carrier features like video calling and wifi calling. i bought this s9 plus to use on verizon wireless and these features are blocked. the reason they are blocked is because it's an unlocked phone and verizon wants you to spend the big bucks buying the phone from them to use all the features the phone supports. it bs really but that's just how it is. so if you buy this or any unlocked phone then you can expect some of the features not to work. i warned you.
i was highly disappointed when i received a locked device rather than ""unlocked"" as advertised. i was however very pleased with the speed in which i received my replacement, which was the very next day. i contacted amazon and the replacement was sent without even having to return locked device first, something that surprised me.there was no damage to the box or any missing pieces, the device came brand new as expected (even the locked device was in excellent condition). it's been roughly 2-3 weeks since i've been utilizing my device, and i'm very pleased with my purchase. i have had no issues so far *knock on wood*, and it was an easy switch moving from the samsung s6 to the s9.so despite the initial hiccup with the phone being locked, the speed in which it was rectified definitely made up for the initial mix up. so overall i'm happy with my purchase.
this is a great phone and i would buy it again outside of all the tracking that google and samsung do on you that can't be removed no matter how much messing with it you do.my only complaint is that verizon says that it is not a authorize phone even though if you just swap your old sim card into it the device works fine.  it just won't show up on your account as a recognized phone with model number that you can manage but atleast you avoid the activation fee.
i took this phone to a verizon store to set it up and transfer my current verizon phone number to the new phone. they checked the serial number and informed me that this phone is not compatible with their network.
firsti want to say that i am typing this review on my samsung galaxy s9 on verizon with full 4g lte. i wanted to point that out to end the confusion.i got the phone, put the sim card from my old phone into this one and after about 10 minutes of updates and verizon settings it was ready to go.i did not need to do anything special and it works beautifully.excellent phone for an absolute great price. i highly recommend this phone. add it to your save for later and watch the price. i managed to snag this phone brand new factory unlocked for just over $500. i am sure it can be had for about that price (if not less once the s10 comes out).enjoy the phone!
received the product on time, however there were no accessories, on further inspection the phone was fake. all accessories were in chinese, it felt like only a weight was inside the device . the back of the device only had stickers for the camera, led and fingerprint reader. just casually looking on the device you won't be able to tell, but once you actually touch it you can feel it. going through the reviews it seems this happens a lot with the lilac version.amazon customer service was extremely understanding and helpful and quickly processed my oder and i was able to get the black version which i am happy with now.
update april 9: i’ve ordered the samsung galaxy s9 phone twice (two separate occasions) and when i tried to register them at samsung, i found out that the phones were intended for the hong kong market and that samsung us would not warranty the phones.  warranty would only be honored if the phone was sent to hong kong. additionally, these phones have specific hong kong parts so getting a repair in the us may be difficult because parts may not be available. i’ve returned both to amazon with no issues.  in talking with amazon customer service, i was told they were going to pull the inventory and figure out where things went wrong. btw, the only was to find out if the phone is a us marketed phone is to call samsung. you cannot tell by model number and only samsung can tell by the imei number.
the phone arrived in an open box so i assumed it had been used before. i noticed off the bat that the bixby button was stuck so i tried manipulating it with a small tool but it wouldn't work. after initial setup, i figured i would try the phone for a few says and it seemed ok. but, i noticed it was not holding a charge. i reread the description of the phone and realized it was refurbished. so i packed it back up and sent it back. waiting for refund now.
the color on outer edges is peeling, sound quality is poor, pics are good, hard to change keyboardsmain thing is the color on the phone and sound from, improved speakers? i have always used samsung and am disappointed with quality of this one. i have had this for 1 month and 9 days. great, not
received my new phone last week. lots of options & lots to learn. my phone, according to my carrier, is a dual sim. i did put an sd card in the other slot.  my model number is sm-g9650. the phone was unlocked and new in box, as described. took a bit for the carrier personnel  to determine which sim card to use and they were a great help in activating the phone. transfer of information from old phone to new one was very easy using smart switch. the first thing i had to do was switch language from spanish to english. apparently, since this is an unlocked phone, i am unable to set up voice mail. i learned this from you tube, but will double-check with carrier. not sure yet about bixby.11/1/2018:  i visited my carrier and personnel was able to install my voice mail. had to set it up ""the old way."" anyway, it's now working and i'm liking my phone so much better!
i miss my s9. the s10 fingerprint reader is very slow and often fails to recognize my fingerprint. if there is any dust or moisture on your finger, it won't work at all.considering the size of the battery, i thought it would last forever, but it's no better than the s9.the camera specs looked amazing but the low light performance is underwhelming. the video quality is very good, but many of the features are disabled when using uhd@60fps, no video stabilization or tracking auto-focus.
ordered this as a birthday gift for my sister.  she took it to verizon to activate it and was told the imei was already linked to someone's account.  so essentially the phone was stolen and resold.  going through the return/replacement process right now.  hopefully the new one isn't also stolen.  i'll update this once we find out.
overall, i'm sorry i upgraded. it's fast good processor and lots of ram, but the fingerprint reader is clunky and the bixby button is a total deal breaker. i don't think i'll ever buy another phone that has such a button. i'd hold out for something else. at $1000, you should be happy.
everyone knows how great the phone is in pretty much every aspect, but i will address the two most annoying things about this phone and the solutions that worked for me.1.  the fingerprint scanner is fancy and supposed to be secure, but it failed miserably when i saved my fingerprints the first two times.  i had about 50% recognition only, if that.  i thought i had it figured out with a pattern of scanning the print, but then i found a video on this trick and worked better than anything else i tried before.how to fix it:  instead of scanning the same fingerprint 16 or so times at different angles, to get one single fingerprint profile.  start scanning once your right thumb, for example, and when repositioning instead of placing your right thumb again, use your left thumb, then your right thumb again, and so on until you complete one fingerprint profile.  i was amazed on how fast and how accurately the phone recognized both prints.  almost 100% recognition now.2.  the badge count was, on purpose, messed up by samsung.  for example, when you swipe down and dismiss a notification, the badge count goes away, counted as addressed.  some people like the way samsung did it, but i do not.how to fix it:  the is no way to fix this with the stock samsung one ui.  i had to install nova launcher prime.  this allows the count to remain when you dismiss a notification.  in the same way, if you have 50 emails, and delete one, the count will go down by one on the badge, and not make all of them go away the samsung designed it.i hope this helps someone not be as frustrated as i was.
just got my s10 (128gb) yesterday. best phone i've ever owned, no question about. improvements over the s9 - it's faster (snappier response to pretty much everything), the screen is very impressive, and it's somehow bigger and smaller at the same time (more screen, less total device volume). the on-screen fingerprint scan is nice, but i had become used to the old one just fine (although, i suspect i had perpetual fingerprints on the s9's camera lens). the facial recognition is much faster than the s9. i have not yet exercised the camera enough to declare it's value versus the s9, but i always found the s9's camera to be excellent. so, 5 stars for the phone itself, hands-down.now... samsung. every time i purchase from them directly there seems to be some ""gotcha."" this time it was the ""free earbuds"" offer, apparently i missed something in the fine print at order time so i'm out of luck. ok, i would have bought the phone anyway, but they seem to over-promise and under-perform. i'd prefer they just promise what they can deliver and deliver what they promise. why sour me on a terrific phone over some bogus marketing offer? (just for reference, when i bought my s9 i went through a similar jumping-through-hoops process). anyway, that's why a terrific phone earns only 4 stars instead of 5.
whyyyyy better than the iphone xr
don't bother buying this phone it's already over heating on me and only had it 3 weeks! it gets so hot during phone calls you have get off the phone and turn it off for awhile to cool down. i have sprint and they have tried a hard reset and still hasn't fixed the problem.
dont listen to any bad review cause obviously they are just hating and dont even have the phone yet, smh.
it's a good phone way better than the 9
came from an s7 and i'm so happy i got this phone. it's fast, battery lasts all day, the cameras are great and very versatile. on top of that having the possibility of adding extra storage and a headphone jack are what made me choose the s10 over a pixel 3. the fingerprint reader can use improvement but i use the face unlock, so it doesn't bother me much. i can definitely recommend the phone.
i just got this phone yesterday and so far it is an amazing phone! great performance and beautiful screen! upgraded from a galaxy s8 and so far i'd say that it a really good upgrade! the fingerprint sensor in the screen is great and works well.
i pre-ordered the phone because amazon told me by chat that they were participing in the galaxy buds promotions of samsung. fake, i did not get anything, and now amazon and samsung are saying that is each other fault. they don't want to anything about it.
muy bueno
first rate phone. good value.
i purchased what i thought would be a 128gb s10+ factory unlocked.  instead i received an already opened unsealed package with a verizon network version of the s10+.  buyer beware!  i think many of the reviews for this product are fake!
great screen, great performance and great camera. fingerprint scanner is not perfect but it works fine once you get used to it. the hole punch in the screen is perfect, not intrusive at all and looks really cool.
just perfection! i love the display, the camera, and the other loads of features it comes with.
my brother loves it
this is a really super cool phone. the look ,design ,camera everything....there is nothing which i don't like
definitely recommend changing out the screen protector but other than that the best phone i've ever owned !
best phone of 2019.
love it! perfect size!
love it traded in my galaxy s9 for the 512 gb model. best phone i have ever owned.  battery last me over a day and a half.
no airports. mega disappoint.
i had very high hopes for this phone because of the form factor but my s9 is just so much better!  first, the haptic home button is gone!  if you have any security enabled you cannot long press the home button to bypass the lockscreen, double tap to wake will not do it.  the call quality is not the greatest, the signal strength is terrible compared to my s9, the fingerprint scanner is way too high and the smart lock feature barely works even after gps calibration!!  ugh!!i am reviewing just the s10e!  i have not used the other s10's just to be clear.  sad they choose to lump all the reviews for all the s10 line but that is not my choice.
i can’t believe how horrible the fingerprint scanner is on this thing. during setup i had to push way too hard on the screen for it to register my fingerprint, and once set up it failed to recognize my fingerprint more than 50% of the time. i tried different fingers and tried re-registering them twice. even tried a factory reset. huge disappointment, had to return it. getting the note 9 instead since it’s $350 off.
finally upgraded from my galaxy s5.  this s10e is fast.  i love the new ui. it's very easy to use and intuitive. the battery so far lasts an easy 15 hours with wifi on, streaming videos and tunein radio. i got the 256gb model which is a lot of space coming from a 16gb phone.  plus i added a 400gb sd card.  purchased a vava usb-c hub and the s10e switches to dex mode on my 55 inch tv and works perfectly. call quality and volume are great. the wide angle lens camera is excellent.  pro mode lets me shoot in raw mode for more photo editing ability. the side fingerprint scanner is a little high in the placement but i'm getting used to it.  it is extremely fast in response time for unlocking.  the phone arrived fully sealed in it's original box.  one thing to note.  i thought i read somewhere that the s10e comes with a case in the box.  this was not true.  not a big deal.  i just had to order a new case to go with the phone.  overall very happy with this purchase
bought this to use as a phone, of course,  and something to play pubg mobile on. the s10 is way more unstable and buggy than my s9 as of right now. the s10 is as fragile, if not, more fragile than the s9. accidentally dropped my phone from my computer desk and now the whole bottom right of the screen is full of cracks and completely shattered in a concentrated spot. very disappointed. so far, i haven't seen any real improvement over the s9.
loveeee the phone. it's amazing without a doubt.i really thought the s10 would be fine for my hand size....guess time to go for the +
i travel all over the us and europe and this phone works great.  sleek form, fit, and function-- a+.  i purchased an armband for running/working out and the phone has had zero issues.  important note to all purchasing, the phone 'comes with a pre-installed screen protector' which is solid.  my wife has long acrylic fingernails and was unable to peel it from the screen.  overall i'm satisfied with the phone upgrade (upgraded from an s7 edge).  my only issue is all my previous charging cables for the s7 are null, as the s10 has a different charging port requiring me to purchase new charging cables.
samsung hasn't made many improvements to the device since the s8. sad but true. yea the camera is a little better, but many of the same quirks and bugs remain. the automatic unlock based on location is still flakey, the screen based fingerprint sensor is hit or miss at best, and my biggest complaint - they've done away with the notification led. now you have to unlock your phone to see if you have any missed calls or txt msgs! what the f were you thinking on that one samsung? but hey, at least we still have that useful headphone jack! not impressed. 3 stars at best. truth be told, the google pixel is a better device. no samsung bloatware, no useless gimmicks like a curved screen edge which you can't use when the phone is in a case and serves no practical purpose anyway, etc...
samsung stated that if the phone was purchased by a certain date, the phone came with a set of wireless earbuds.  while i like the phone, i am upset that the advertised ""free"" item was ignored.  the moral of the story - amazon may not fulfill what was advertized; or, if you pay for something with points, they take their time and accept the order until later.  had i known this, i would not have rushed to buy it.  had i not have had this problem, i would have given it another star.  by the way, it does not come with an s stylus like previous phones and tablets.
hi this is my first samsung phone. i love it. only had it for 2 days. my old phone was a nexus 4. i ordered the 128 gb version s10+. i was pleasantly surprised when i opened the package, there was an extra 128 gb micro sd card. sweet. also came with a mintmobile sim chip with 3 months free service. made my guilt over a 1000 dollar purchase into happy. i had heard and read that the fingerprint id on samsung s10+ was hard to use.i used my right thumb, and i have not had a single problem. very happy with my purchase.
it doesn't have dual sim support like my previous s9. don't know what i'm going to do now.
my previous phone (nexus 6p) developed the reboot loop problem.  i needed a new phone quickly, and amazon delivered it the next day.after letting the battery charge a bit, all i needed to do was swap the sim card.  during initial setup, the phone found my backups -- it felt like christmas morning as a kid.  there's a fair amount of difference between the 2 phones.  i really like that the power button is not on the same side as the volume buttons.  i'm still getting used to the home screen.  right now it seems awkward, but i think that's just a matter of it being different.although i don't have enough time with it to rate the battery life, it seems pretty good.  i haven't tried the face recognition -- i'm too ugly.  :-)  i'll give that a shot later.the phone is a bit smaller than my old one, but the screen fills more of the phone, so is pretty close to the same usable area.i'd recommend this phone...  i just wish it wasn't so expensive.
this is the second review i've made. along with receiving my phone a week after it was expected, it came straight from the box with chinks in the screen and the screen is so fragile that almost every day a new dent shows up in the screen from just sitting in my pocket (with a case) i don't move around too much. i have an office job so there's no reason for the screen to dent so much
i ordered two of these, one for myself, one for my husband.  mine is working ok.  my husband's right out of the box started overheating, feeling like it was burning up.  after trying everything suggested, including contacting amazon for assistance, i requested a refund ticket. since this was a 3rd party seller, i had to order a new one.  well, the second phone came the day after i ordered it.  it is burning up too.  i am sending it back now. looking at the internet, i wish i had read about all of the overheating problems with this phone!!!!
no me envío un teléfono, lo que me envío fue
this samsungs with exynos9820 chips
the best phone. amazing screen. super fast processor.games run very smooth. no delays as compared to samsung chip. glad i imported via amazon.
the phone itself is beautiful and works well, battery life could be better. i received a phone that has issues with connectivity to the network. in talking with the sprint customer service it seems like i'm not the only one experiencing this.
very nice phone but this model of the phone does not let you turn off the camera shutter sound no matter what i have tried in the settings.someone please tell me how if you have found a solution other than using a 3rd party camera app.
the box came open and while i ordered black i recieved silver and the phone came scratched.
i upgraded from s9+ to s10. in general it is great smart phone. one of the great feature that the processor is super fast with downloading or surfing the web and very stable. however i have the following downsides on the s10: 1. the finger print recognision is not as easy or smooth to unlock the devise, s9 finger print is faster and more accurate. 2. battery life in s9+ does last longer than the s10.
the phone arrived, but i thought pre-order comes with wireless buds
i bought this in ceramic white unlocked. this is supposed to have the dual sim but it seems like you can only put one nano sim and one micro sd.
i preordered the s10e and received it 2 days before official release.  i was stoked they were sending them out early.  i won't go into much tech detail since others will do that for me.the pros is i love the size, weight, and overall appearence of the phone. camera is great.  getting accessories is alot easier than my s7 active was.there is only 3 cons to this phone.  the first is the battery. mine wouldn't last nearly all day. i had to turn off and disable almost every app to preserve battery life.  so after being at work with it on silent for 8 hours then coming home and using it to play games and shop amazon for 5 hours. it was 15% by the time i went to bed. 2nd is not a biggie since i imagine i'll adapt soon.  the edge to edge screen is awesome but if u play any games you need to hold the phone with your fingertips because the slightest bit of skin hits the edge of the screen and you will be doing something in your game you don't wish too. lastly the colors aren't as vibrant as my s7 active. side by side and the clear loser is s10e. maybe there is additional settings i don't know about yet but i eventually get around to looking it up.conclusion:  i will keep this phone and continue to use it (mainly because i can't return it and will give it a decent chance), since the only thing i do on cell phones is make calls, text very little, occasional web surf, and mainly play games.  i did keep my s7 active.  dispite the s7 active being 3 years older it still has a superior battery, it will last almost 2 times as long as the brand new s10e.  any trips or hiking i do i will switch the sim card back to my trusty workhorse.
just received my new phone. very fast delivery, every thing looks good.
i'm glad i bought this expensive a** thing. i regretted it at first, but i mean.. its a phone. its ok to spend this kind of money on a device that rolls with you 24/7. it's specs are beefy and i havn't had any real issues.
this is a really good product. first i got the empty  box, then replaced it with new one. no complaints  about that now. but s10+ is really cool, it's factory unlocked.  works with all networks.
seems like the best galaxy that has come out so far.
best phone by far, would like if the fingerprint sensor be better . camera is excellent
fantastic.
great phone
refund..
i ordered this for the snapdragon 855 processor and  us warranty. instead i realized that i had received the slower international version with the exynos processor that is even slower than the s9 processor. the model number of the phone i received is completely different from the model number on this page. the us warranty is also not honored. i found this out after setting up the phone and looking under the about phone option. i am returning this phone for sure. don't buy it here and risk getting a inferior phone when you are paying 1000 dollars. it's really disappointing.
its a good phone.  not great but good.  going from the s7 to the s10 was quite  change since the front physical button went away.  i love the full screen but definitely miss my button.  the fingerprint detector normally takes me a few times before it unlocks which is the only main frustration in my book.  the second minor grump is sometimes when it is unlocked the screen looks as if its still locked so i continue to touch it before i notice that it is actually open and you just need to swipe to make it look open.  maybe they could change the blur to the app icons immediately when the fingerprint works?the speaker is a huge improvement.  music and phone calls sound even more clear than with the s7.  it also seems to have a much louder volume ability with apps such as spotify which was an issue with the s7.  the camera(s) are a big improvement as well.  lots of photo options and even better pics in dim areas.the processor speed is also noticeable.  it opens apps and slides flawlessly.  very smooth operation and video is almost instant.  i am pleased with the purchase and am hoping they can fix the few bugs mentioned before with software patches.
overall i'm quite happy with this phone, but i do want to share a few small quirks and annoyances i've come across.i like its overall size, though it does seem a bit heavy.  it is small enough for me to slip into a pants pocket, but because of its weight i definitely know it's there.  the display is beautiful, and i love that it goes all the way to the right and left edges of the phone -- in fact, there's an ""edge"" feature which allows you to pull in a special customizable folder/menu from the side of the screen just by swiping it.now, a few quirks/tips:1) the fingerprint reader does work, but as other have noted, it seems to be finicky.  through trial and error i have discovered that one of the most important things you can do to assure your finger will be read properly is hold it very still while it's pressed to the sensor.  yes, you do have to press with sufficient force but not ""too"" hard, but i have found that the amount of pressure i exert seems to matter far less than holding my finger very, very still against the sensor.2) the power button is on the right side of the phone, and the volume up/down buttons are directly across from it on the left edge of the phone.  unfortunately this means that depending on how i'm holding the phone, i often end up pressing the ""volume down"" button while i'm pressing the power button, which causes the phone to take a screen shot.  it's not the end of the world, but i end up having to delete a lot of unintended screen shots.3) as others have noted, you will definitely want some sort of case for this phone, as it has virtually no grip and it would be sad to see it hit the pavement.4) i have heard some people complain about the type of screen protector the phone comes with.  i, for one, have left it on the phone because i actually like its feel -- it is smooth and doesn't seem to have much ""drag"" on your finger like some of the silicone-type screens.
summary: great upgrade from galaxy s7 in terms of screen resolution and speed.pros: bluetooth distance has improved, battery life is better, fast response time (using nova launcher), very good signal, improved storage space, fingerprint reader works great for me, body feels solid and looks amazing, unlocked version runs almost all the verizon branded apps, usb-c is fastcons: fingerprint reader is hit or miss,high price, latest android os unable to record calls with acr (thanks google!), needs protective case for curved glass, not a lot of color choices, doesn't run all the verizon branded apps, usb-c requires changing all non-wireless accessories or getting gender change adapters (they're cheap but an inconvenience.)conclusion: even without a good trade-in deal and 24 months same as cash financing, it's a worthy upgrade.
+rants=get this one (snapdragon 7mm), not the exynos (8mm) because it's faster!, i come from an exynos region but ordered this one in because i always knew of that discrepancy in performance between the variants over the galaxy s history. check the benchmark reviews. also, this one has fm radio receiver in it, just plug in a headphones to act as the antenna and use nextradio app to not stream, but receive actual fm radio signals from the local area. the adreno gpu is faster than the exynos one by a good margin if you're going to be playing games like pub-g. bixby is ultra smooth on this, compared too ocassional hiccup on the s8. that 8gb of ram surely helped there. the one ui is the best i've seen so far... it has all kinds of new things in it. the software is alot more friendly now,-rants=i dont like the silver sides, preffered the all black like s8. (getting a black/+ish case to help with this), and the hole punch notification led simulator isn't enabled yet for some strange reason? - i dont want to have to install 3rd party apps for this which will drain the battery! this should be part of the system right now. edge lighting is so old and the other option is to use the camera flash what the hell? the fingerprint sensor could take some getting used to, it's advised to register the same preferred finger 2 or more times to improve the hit-rate, and i've done that and it works (samsung is planning an update in the near future to improve this.that's all for now.
this phone sucks up all of your free time with its numerous technological features, the worst part about it is that you'll never have enough time to explore all of them.
this s10 phone is truly impressive. the face recognition works well. the processor is remarkably fast. can run more than 1 app at a time without causing any lagging. the camera is next level incredible.
i just got this galaxy s10 plus today but the phone doesn let make video call like all other phone. u have to download google duo o any other video app. but the phone doesn show the camera icon while u are in a call. i went to tmobile wich is my carrier and the galaxy s10 they have it shows the option when u callin somebody to change from regular call to video call.
contact names don't show when they call me, i literally can't see who is calling me, i contacted samsung and they said they are working on it and it has been a month since it came out and it haven't.
it's great phone but unfortunately i had to return it because at&t locked it in their service and i couldn't switch to another carrier.
el teléfono funciona de maravilla me agrada mucho la pantalla para mi el reconocimiento de huella esta super bien una vez que te acostumbras a su ubicación las cámaras excelentes
disliked the interfacedisliked the overall setupnot good interface as iphone xs
looks like iphonex. the glass and metal texture make it a really high quality product.
is perfect phone is more then what i expect
una nave. teléfono precioso, rápido y muy cómodo a la mano. lástima que no haya venido con los ear buds
i have been using s10+ since last week ,and i have recently upgraded from s9+pro's~looks and feel is great~runs fine~camera is awesome~awesome dispalycons-:samsung really need to step up when it comes to basic .~very poor network reception, many places my s9+ have 50% more network connection.~when you are taking a call from wifi and move out of network the call disconnects(whatsapp) , this was not happening in s9+ although there was 2/3 sec interruption . wifi to lte movement is not seamless~fingerprint sensor is crap beyond imagination -really really shit~samsung support is not upto the mark~crappy return policyi will update more as i spend more time with this phone .i am very very dissatisfied
great phone, camera is awesome.
the galaxy s10 has brought back the joy and extended the usability of a smart phone in 2019.
yes i like it very well especially not having an edge screen. i really like a flat screen better. it’s very easy to work like my s9 was.
great device. even better than i expected
love this phone its light narrow enuff for one hand .my earbuds are on the way from samsung. yes if you preordered you qualify for them it's just a simple process you do through samsung app shop app registration is easy.its fast phone only problem is my first one .you could only add 8 apps to sd card. turns out this one too is the same way samsung doesn't know why
so i have been using the phone for a bit over a month now. often i find myself using the pattern unlock vs using the finger print reader, as it can take a few times to get it to unlock with my thumbprint.battery life is just meh and it seems to take a long, long time to charge. i bought a wireless fast charger that was samsung and samsung certified but it takes like 9 hours to charge up the phone if i let it get down to 10 to 15%.  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b0797f2v5c/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=utf8&psc=1corded charging does work better but it's still a slow charge compared to the nexus 70% charge in 15 minutes.i have used the built in batter saver app and even cutting everything down and scrimping wherever i can i find it drops 10 to 15% of its charge overnight just sitting on the dresser doing nothing. if i am using it to just listen to music a few hours can eat 30 to 40% power. this is not streaming, its music that has been downloaded to the phone. this seems like way too much power usage for this.the screen seems vibrant and colorful. however, it also has wrapping issues, where text and the picture often are fitted off the edge of the screen. i was looking through the samsung app store and they had an advertisement for one of the apps. it took me a couple minutes to figure out one of the words as it was so far off the screen. the word was world and all i could see was the wo...i find this annoying. the screen is also smaller than what i expected the plus model to be.i did like that it integrates with my car pretty well and the maps has a cool feature that will allow you to display the map from a satelite view. however, i found that if i tried using this mode while trying to play music, the sound and map developed stutter and played choppy. however, i did like that it (in general) did actually show the speed limit of the roads i was traveling and i never saw that on my old nexus and is a feature i missed that you see in almost every cheap gps unit.cellular signal is much worse than my previous nexus 6 p device. i often find in places where i had 3 to 4 bars of signal on the nexus i often get 1 bar and i see the dreaded ""no signal icon"" pretty often, especially when on the drive home. once again, my nexus did not have this issue, so i have to assume that the antenna in this unit is just not as good.i do like the bluetooth on the unit, it has a setting that lets it send bluetooth to more than one device. i think this is a great feature and something bluetooth should have had for a long time now. it also seems to remember the volume settings for individual devices. i really hated on my nexus having to constantly turn down bluetooth for my headset and then turn it back up the moment i hopped in my car.i do not like their bixby app but there is a whole button dedicated to this ""samsung"" app and although i tried disabling the app and the button. neither were completely successful and there is no way to remove the app.overall it’s an okay phone but for what this thing costs it should be a great phone. $500 to $600 tops in my opinion would have been a much more fair price.i also did not like the fact that amazon just tossed the phone in the shipping box, not inside of the s10+ box like it should have been so mine arrived with a scratch on the screen. i do not blame samsung for that part though.
love this phone. have not used face thing yet. i think it's the best phone i've bought in awhile. i still am finding out great options that i didn't know it had. the camera is amazing.!!!
anyone has the right to buy whatever they want, u have to be sure of what u want..... i'm never disappointed with the galaxy fam! (:
this is a beautiful phone. i've had 4 of the previous galaxy phones, so i'm very well accumulated with android and samsung. everyone knows how awesome android is and how superior samsung screens are, they continue to get better each time. unfortunately the screen is too sensitive to use without a case on it.  you simply can't n't hold the phone without your hands or fingers touching the edges and working against what you are actually trying to press. once my otter box phone case arrive a day later, the problem was solved! make sure you get all the full updates before adding your fingerprint.  mine didn't work at all until the update. for whatever reason.best phone yet!
the thumbprint reader is located on the edge of the phone. top right edge and it means that your phone cases need to have a large cut out right by the edge and every case made for this phone will be very weak right there. i guess it's only a design flaw in the sense that phone cases will be hard to make well for this phone. i personally never use the thumbprint reader. i wish this phone had it on the back or just didn't have one at all. looking for a case that actually just covers this spot since i never use it and would prefer a good case.ohterwise, amazing phone. great camera. very fast. still has the headphone jack! it's smaller than anything else this nice. got a lot of things going for this phone!
i previously have s9 for work and iphone xs max for personal, here are my thoughts:the good:- speakers... wow... i am speechless- oneui is wow, samsung finally got the ui right, very user friendly and fluid- feels very comfortable to hold, much better than s9 and iphone- screen is gorgeous, but a little too bright at night- bixby routine eliminated my need for tasker- headphone jack, although i didn't use it once, but it is nice to know it is there- samsung health is very very useful- all hail 8gb of ram, all of my apps opened within the hour are still there!- battery life is good (not excellent, pretty on-par with iphone xs max)the meh:- power button is a bit too high, need to adjust grip when turning off screen- back camera is good, but pretty much feels the same as s9 and iphone (disclaimer: i am a dummy photo taker, pretty much point-and-shoot)- samsung still nags too much on ""here is what you can do on..."" and ""high volume can damage your hearing...""- micro stutter during animation, rare, but still noticeable during app switch- fingerprint unlock to home is slow, and it is much lower than i expected, but once i got the position, it unlocks 9/10 times (move your fingers around during scanning, it helps a lot), and i didn't even remove the original screen protector- microphone is sub-par... especially during call, other side can hear their own echo, not the same experience on s9 or iphonethe wtf were they thinking:- proximity sensor, it is waking up in my pocket all the damn time (turned off double tap to wake helps, turning off life to wake and aod solved the issue, but i need to features)- still very convoluted to pick pictures from google photo if i need to send pictures or upload pictures from other apps- samsung smart switch is still a very miss, transferring to s9 to s10 plus made the phone very buggy, have to start fresh and redo every thing- samsung keyboard... sigh... back to gboard- front camera... i want to see my face without looking like a 12 year-old damn it- curved screen, i felt like it is even worse than the s9 (maybe it is the size), a case helped with accidental touches, but my god it is still happening- oneui is awesome, but the way they treat folders... if i created a folder in the app drawer and put apps there, then put that same folder to home screen, why are they not synced? why i must add the same app to folder twice? (i don't want to use another launcher, i used nova launcher for 6 years and just want to use the built-in launcher for the sake of simplicity)- on the few occasions that i cannot use the fingerprint scanner (enough to be a nuisance), i really miss the iris scanner... this was the #1 reason why i did not pick iphone to be the work phone before- samsung cloud... still cannot see sd card... just give up already samsung...- motion photo is still not compatible with google photo (this has more to do with google than samsung, but samsung uses their own format to save motion photo, so i am blaming both)- power optimization still sucks (again, android's problem, not samsung's fault)so in summary, i feel like each functionality of the phone works very well, but the unify experience is still somewhat lacking
like italmost the same size as my former galaxy s7edge
after using this phone for 3 weeks and coming from an iphone se, it is hard to see it as an upgrade in anything other than a larger display.what i like is the display quite a bit easier to read compared to the 4"" screen that the iphone has.the wide angle camera option on the rear.dex support to mirror to a television via hdmi adaptor cable.the speaker on it is great for listening to music.no limit on size of download for podcasts.and the size and weight is reasonable for a larger phone.what i don't like is the reduced bezel on the display essentially requires some kind of case to increase the distance between hand and phone, accidental touches are common without a case.the fingerprint sensor is too high/ difficult to reach and the volume buttons are directly across on the other side, causing unwanted screen shots frequently.it is difficult to one hand the phone due to its size and the lack of useful gestures that iphones have.the app store is lacking quality apps.the camera doesn't have an option of a fake long exposure like the iphone has. the option to adjust the settings in pro mode are nice but that requires nd filters to have the same effect during the day. (i was able to find one app that is able to do a similar effect but requires a tripod to use effectively, and clogs up the gallery.)the main rear camera doesn't seem to be very sharp and lacks any color depth, anything but very minor adjustments ruins the photo.the wide angle camera is not able to be used in pro mode. it also isn't very sharp.the display is alway tuning on for no reason.samsung apps require permissions to access everything or they won't update.face recognition for keeping the display on while reading doesn't work.the headphone buttons don't work properly. to start playing a song from the remote on the ear buds requires three button presses, doesn't matter which app or headphone, i've tried a couple.antenna strength isn't as good as my old phone.if apple wasn't actively trying to screw over their customers, i'd probably be happier with an iphone 8.
this is international version it is exynos not snapdragon! i had to return.
the phone itself doesn't seem to have any problems. my only main issue was how the phone's initial packaging seems to have been tampered with. there was only one piece of tape holding my phone box. no plastic wrap. (see picture)
this review is for s10 model. my previous phone was a sam s5, so that is my comparison. i am a practical person, not much gaming or social media. my phone is my workhorse. here is my good and bad...fingerprint - works 50% and you need to press hard. the pattern unlock is faster.curved glass - the curved glass edge of s10 was always causing me to false touch the screen. looks nice though.telephoto - i looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so i will not take advantage of telephoto.glass back plate - seems useless to me. you need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? just adds more weight. same for colors- covered by case.screen - beautiful. and it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). a little longer than i am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.wifi calling - not supported on this unlocked model. you need a carrier branded version in usa.performance. its fast! the north america version contains the newest qualcomm 855 cpu.camera - not used enough yet to comment.i think i am leaning to swap this out for the s10e version.
download the shop samsung app and head over to ""my inbox"". it should be the first thing to show up! i do not know how long you have to claim it but there you go!
great phone over all. camera is awesome, especially the wide angle. samsung edits their pictures so they look smoother. i do suggest trying out the google camera apk; the pictures look so much better than any apple pictures. the battery lasts all day. recently went on a road trip and the phone lasted all day if you're going to text, play games, watch movies, etc. if i have plans for the night i charge it for 30 minutes and that lasts me the night. the speaker hass alright base, and its loud and clear. the microphone works very well on speaker phone, the other caller can't tell the difference if i'm in a quiet place. if you're looking to upgrade, this is a solid phone. i had the note 4 before, and waited for a device that wouldn't disappoint.
i've only been using this phone for a few days but wanted to share some first impressions.pros:1. the phone gives you an amazing amount of screen space with almost no bezel and the screen is stunningly beautiful. for a phone of this size, it doesn't seem overly large and being a woman, i have relatively small hands so size is very noticeable to me and whether i can hold and use the phone comfortably in one hand.2. it's also amazingly thin and light for the amount of battery power and life you get. i spent all kind of time playing with it and downloading new apps and it still had 60% battery life. very nice. time will tell how soon it need battery replacement, something that's been a big issue for me with my iphones, how soon they seem to go bad.3. if you haven't had wireless charging before, you will love it. i almost never have to plug my phone in having wireless charging pads or stands wherever needed. the reverse charging is a nice option although i didn't get my free buds yet so haven't had a chance to try them out but i've had other wireless buds and they always seem to start having issues fairly quickly for the high cost. if you are single like me, the ability to charge another phone isn't all that helpful but for families it may be a really nice plus. it does also mean you have to be careful about the case you get if you want to make sure it works with this feature. ones that support wireless charging are not necessarily going to work for the reverse charging.4. lots of great camera options and of course, five cameras (3 on the back, 2 on the front). this was a big reason i got this camera, and it's a lot of fun to play with them, but see the cons for my experience with them. super slo mo video is also very cool to play with. coming from an older phone, the options here are a joy, particularly the pro mode. in the past i've had to use other camera apps to get even close to what the pro mode can do.5. android os and samsung's version in particular is awesome for power users like myself that love to tweak everything. coming from an iphone it's a joy to be able to customize my phone so much. i particularly appreciate the one-handed features when using a large phone like this (but see the cons list again).6. lots of security options in terms of how to protect your phone. face id is a fast way to unlock the phone but easily faked, so not very secure. i've had issues with it in the past as well when the lighting is not good. the new fingerprint scanner is supposedly very hard to fake and works in lots of conditions.7. plenty of space with 128 gig memory to start with, and it has microsd which is nice if you want to load up lots of music and video for a trip (not so much for everyday use). i also love that it still has a headphone jack. the ability of the phone to recharge headphones is nice, but there aren't many that will work with it yet and nothing sucks more than your bt headphones dying and not being able to plug in a backup set of normal ones.cons:1. the design of the phone is pretty blah and it's super slippery. you want to get a case on this thing asap. the sensitivity of it all the way up to the edges makes this even more important, trying to turn it from portrait to landscape without a case seems to always cause it to think i'm clicking on something. i really don't see it being usable at all without having at least a minimal case on to hold it with. also the plastic screen ""protector"" it comes with is not going to do much protecting and is the kind that is easily rolled on the sides when trying to get the phone in and out of cases.2. which brings me to con #2. the fingerprint scanner. this was touted as such a huge breakthrough but seems a step back to me from having used scanners on the outside of the case or in a button as they were on my iphone. first, there's nothing to help you feel for where to put your finger, no haptic feedback or anything to give you help with getting your finger in the right place other than the visual pseudo-button on the screen, and the messages that come up to tell you it couldn't read your print are so ridiculously tiny and hard to read. you have to press quite hard on the screen, maybe eventually i'll get the hang of it but right now it's constantly telling me to press harder. i've never had that issue with normal scanners. it also makes using glass protectors on the front far more difficult as many will render it unusable.3. for as much as the wide and tele lens are touted by samsung, the quality of the images you get with them are pretty sub-par. at best, you can get semi-decent photos outside in excellent light, but compared to the primary lens, particularly for indoor shots the difference is very obvious. likewise they talked about having a ""night mode"" that would rival the quality of the pixel 3, but it's nowhere close. the pictures are far too soft and clearly not using the kind of hdr that google is using in the pixel to produce such good low light shots. outside in bright light shots tend to have blown out areas still. i also get frustrated at how only the normal photo and video modes will allow you to use the wide and tele lens (pro and super slo mo for instance will not), and how much you have to let the camera control what's happening such as using scene detection (vs. being able to set the type of scene myself). granted it's still a big improvement having a pro mode at all, but there's still more i want to be able to do. they still seem to think throwing hardware at us will suffice without addressing the software side, but for top-quality photos, the pixel 3 with its one lens is still going to win out in many situations. likewise the additional front-facing lens for selfies. i'd much rather have had the wide-angle view the pixel 3 offers vs. using up space on the front just for a camera to help blur the background. do they even bother to ask users what they most want?  luckily the folks at moment support even these new phones with their great professional addon lens, so i'll be upgrading my kit for their new super-wide angle and tele lens as certainly the performance from the main lens with its adjustable aperture is quite excellent. but i'm glad at least to have the additional lenses built into the camera to use when i don't feel like carrying the extra lenses with me, as i usually don't in my daily routine. but if only google could deliver a phone that isn't sub-par on battery life as the pixels have been, they would probably pull even more customers like me over, but as much as i care about my photos looking awesome, i've had my share of having to carry battery chargers around all day to deal with phones that die out too quickly.4. as much as the os gives me some good one-handed options, the hardware design seems to completely ignore it. why are the buttons so freaking high on the phone?! i've used an s9 and don't recall it being this bad. the power button (which doubles as the camera button on a double press) is particularly frustratingly high. the volume toggle as well, virtually impossible to reach without using the other hand.5. there's still some things about the android/samsung os that i find baffling and frustrating. at times i get lost trying to find my way back because something i did sent me off somewhere else. a number of times i've ended up in the animoji section of the camera app and couldn't figure out how to get back to the regular camera. far too often it relies on dragging or other screen gestures when a simple menu option to switch screens would be so much more user friendly. likewise how confusing it is that the bluetooth setup shows me all these mac ids of devices i can't connect to. it's almost comical what that screen looks like in a large gym these days. why not just show me the ones i *can* connect to? it's definitely not always easy to use a really feature-heavy device like this and not sure i'd recommend it to less experienced users.6. likewise between all the stuff google wants to control and samsung loads on the phone, i feel like i'm turning over my entire lives to these companies privacy wise. i quickly switched it over to using duckduckgo for web searches and use other privacy features, but it's concerning how much access these big companies want to what you do on your phone. samsung does provide a vpn service on the phone you can use as well to help keep your activity secure, but do i trust they are not using that to track me? given what companies like facebook have done when people give them a phone number to enable 2-factor auth, i'm not sure i trust any of them anymore.7. price. we're in iphone range now with this phone. it's clear that samsung is justifying pushing the price up with additional hardware features like the improved screen, more storage, in-screen fingerprint scanner and extra cameras. some are definitely a step up, but others, like the scanner and sub-par cameras, not so much. some like the reverse charging may in time be more beneficial than it likely will be for most people initially.overall, this is still a really good phone. however, if you are happy with 64 gig, i'd probably recommend getting an s9+ and saving a good bit of money. there's really nothing on the s10+ that is so much improved that it's worth hundreds of dollars... and some things are a bit of a step backward imo. however if you really want 128 gig, this phone is worth the relatively small additional bump in price over an s9+ with comparable storage.
amazon had fast & safe shipping...kudos to them, they did their part. samsung created a great phone with this one. snappy os system, camera is great, battery seems good, i have been downloading and using the camera and battery is draining like any other phone under heavy use. i do believe that the battery on this unlocked version will be better than a carrier version...there is no bloatware running in the background. the screen is just...the best i have ever seen. size, i like the 10+ size, its big..i have gym shorts and when i sit...it's poking out the top big. decent weight (you know its there) so far so good.now, a couple things with the phone and the pre-order fiasco,1. the phone comes with a screen protector on it already from the factory, so save your money.2. it does not come with a sim card, depending on your situation, you may have to go to your carrier and ask them for a new sim card...because your old one might not be compatible. (i had to take it to sprint, they gave me a new sim and activated it)3. do not freak out at the little grey bar on the extreme right,(in the middle past the curve) bezel. those are not dead pixels, thats the mini menu/quick access thing. hold and drag left to show the menu.4. the earbuds situation, i pre-ordered this phone in late february, on this website. i saw an ad on here that said i would qualify for the earbuds. i called amazon, the rep said ok, he will call samsung and get the details. i said ok, he called me back later and said ""  log into the samsung shop and redeem for your earbuds "". he was right it worked, so download the samsung shop app, and put in your information and you have to send proof that your pre-ordered before march 8. i took a screen shot of my amazon page order details.ok, so thanks, and if your samsung, ill take a wireless charging pad if you got one laying around you dont need anymore.
i've been using the samsung s8 for the past two years without any major issues. so i decided to purchase the s10e since it was about the same price i paid for the s8. but after using the s10e for a few days, i don't like it as much. first off, the pixel density of the s8 is about 100ppi higher. some may not notice a difference, but i do. small text looks ""out of focus"" on the s10e, but is sharp and clear on the s8. also, the front camera ""hole"" is a constant distraction when using the phone.the second issue with the always on display does not turn off if the phone is in your pocket, and keeps using the battery. from what i've read, this is a ""know issue"" on all s10 models, as the proximity sensor does not work properly. on my s8, the always on display turns off in my pocket or if i place the phone screen-down on a table.lastly, i'm really missing the led notification light. all my previous samsung phones (s and notes) had the led notification, as it was easy to tell from a distance if there was a missed call, new message, or e-mail. but with the s10e there isn't a notification light that keeps blinking, so i'm always having to checked the always on display for new notification.at this point, i'll be returning the s10e, as it feels like a downgrade from my s8. even if i went with the regular s10, it would have a higher resolution screen like my s8, but would still be missing the led notification light and the always on display would stay turn on inside of a pocket using the battery. maybe i'll go with the s9, or lg g8 when it comes out.------------update:after owning the s8 for the past two years, i first got the s10e and didn't care for it, and exchanged it for the regular s10.i do like the s10 more than the s10e. but with that being said, it's not a huge upgrade from my s8, and is actually missing features.first off, the ultrasonic fingerprint reader on the s10 works about 50% of the time. i even registered my right thumb as finger 1-4, and it still has issues reading it. the face detection does work (in good lighting) but isn't as secure. what was best was the iris scanner on the s8/s9. it was fast, accurate and secure.next, there is no led notification light on the s10 series. this means you can't easily tell if you had a call or message by a flashing color light, and instead you are dependent on the always on display that you have to check. i really missed the led notification light when using the s10 and found myself always checking the phone for missed alerts.now for the good...the screen on the s10 is a modest step up from the s8. i'm not fond of the camera hole, but did get use to it. the cameras also took good quality pictures, and i'm glad to see a dedicated wide-angle lens (like my lg g5 had). call quality was good, signal reception seemed ok. battery life was better on the s10 than my s8.right now samsung is selling the s9 for under $350, so i may upgrade to that from my s8, since it still has the led notification light and iris scanner.
i am a straight talk customer making the big plunge from an iphone to an android. i expected to lose all of my stuff because of this change but was pleasantly surprised by the samsung s10's ability to back up all of that information. this was an easy transition to a great phone.
i have just received that phone yesterday. it is amazingly fast comparing to my old samsung phone. i have yet to discover all the features.phone came with fast charger, samsung headphones, charging cable, micro usb to c adapter, opening tool.  i was able to easily activate it with metro pcs. i took my old micro sim card of my old phone, made couple of cuts on the outside of that card i made it smaller to the size of a nano sim card required by samsung galaxy s10e.  i was done with activation it within 15 minutes. everything works perfect including calls over wifi.so far i am pleasantly surprised with this phone. with included adapter, i connected this phone with my old phone and transferred all my data and apps to new phone in less then 5 min.i have to admit that this phone feels a little bit slippery and in my opinion requires a case to handle it better.front screen protector feels extremely smooth so there are no fingerprints on it. it feels glassy smooth. amazing.now, when i'm writing this, i've had this phone for almost 5 days.  screen:from what i have seen so far, the camera and a video quality on this phone is superb, just like i read in various reviews.i recorder couple of video clips and when played on this phone i was blown away with how sharp and crisp the picture look like. my friend, when he saw that asked me if this was 4k display. it is so amazing.also, this display has really dark blacks and all pictures and video looks better on it then on my lcd monitor or my tv.  camera:camera has lots of features that will take few hours to explore. i love 2 lenses, wide and regular that allow you to capture everything you want. picture quality is amazing. photos taken with this phone look better then from my regular camera.this s10e has optical image stabilizer when shooting video. there are 2 options. stabilizing and smooth stabilization. both of them give you super smooth video. i will post few clip later.again, i was blown away but low light performance of this camera. i was taking pictures in very low light conditions and picture looked perfect. i can take much better low light pics then when using my regular camera.  battery:on my first day i was using it almost nonstop trying to learn all the features and battery lasted me all day. it was 23% at 8pm. there are great 3 battery saving modes that allow you to adjust battery consumption and your app power load. i posted a pic showing my battery at 35% and in most restricted power mode i have more then a day of battery left. with this extreme mode you still have access to your email, web, sms, camera and gallery. love this option.  finger sensor:finger sensor is on right side. once i scanned fingers i use to unlock it works 99% on first touch. it is fast and easy way to unlock your phone. super easy to use.  bixby:i think it will take a while to use bixby more frequently but i see potential in this samsung version of alexa.my old samsung phone had option of speech recognition in polish for typing. this one does not and this is a bit disappointing.i will post more updated as i learn more about his phone.manual has more then 200 pages and i really need to go through it to learn all the features.i've posted few pics taken with this phone as example of perfect camera quality.enjoy you phone. it is worth it.
i bought this phone and it came in its usual packaging but not factory sealed. just a yellow sticker. during setup, everything was in spanish and i switched it to english and followed through with the setup. even after setup, many apps were in spanish. i put my straight talk sim card in and nothing. i couldn't text, call, browse, etc. i'm pretty sure i was sent an international phone. i also kept getting a message that said ""open channel for bip"". i had no issues with my galaxy s9 plus. for $999, you'd think they'd sent the right product. it's a shame because the phone i ordered was beautiful but useless.
so i bought my phone from another seller who was prime eligible in order to save money on taxes (buying from amazon directly wanted me to pay almost $100+ making this phone over $850 for the 10e)the seller was very responsive and did give me the 10e like i ordered however, i belive this phone was intended for a mexico or south american market and not the north american market.i have cpu-z installed on my phone which allows me to examine the hardware on the phone and instead of getting the new snap dragon 855 processor this phone has samsung processor the exynos 920 processor which is anywhere from 5 to 20% slower depending on the applications used. it can even be slower than last years snapdragon 845 processor in certain video rendering tasks. this is incredible disappointing for me however it did come with a couple of items that did make it a little bit better to swallow such as a free 128gb microsd card and a free case (not sure if that's standard or not) which was a nice touch.let me be clear this is still a fantastic phone and a great upgrade from my lg g6. but i wish that i had the snapdragon phone instead of this exynos one just for longevity sake. the extra goodies though do make it worth it for me to keep the phone instead of exchange it and reordering from samsung directly. plus i don't edit videos on my phone directly so the weakest performance sku doest really affect me too much.i gave it 3 stars just becuase i felt a little decived for paying full price and getting the slightly inferior phone. i also have concerns if samsung will honor the us warranty coverage the product page advertised.overall just be careful who you buy from.
i had a few questions before per-ordering the ceramic white ceramic version of the samsung s10 plus that were difficult to answer using the marketing material alone.  in particular i was wondering about the physical appearance of the ceramic white s10 plus.  well, i received the phone now, so i thought i would drop into amazon and comment on my first impressions.  maybe someone else has similar questions, so hopefully this is helpful to someone.question:  does the metal band around the ceramic white version of this phone have a rose-gold tone?answer:  it does has the very slightest hint of pink in the metal.  but let me emphasize here that it is very subtle.  at first glance it looks silver with no color, but when examined closely a hint of warm color can be detected.  and let me also emphasize that it is beautiful!  the contrast against the pure ceramic white back and the clear glossy black front is perfect.  concern yourself no longer, this is the color to get.  also keep in mind that all other s10 models have the pure silver band, this is the only version that provides the slightest warm tone to the metallurgy.question:  what's the deal with the black samsung s10 plus s-view flip cover, is this official case worth it?yes, it is worth it.  this black case keeps the phone almost as slim and low profile as having no case at all.  the cover is translucent but appears opaque.  the s10 plus can detect when the cover of this case closes and then goes into aod (always on display) mode.  this allows the cover of the case to operate like a screen when desired (while still keeping core functionality locked).  when shut, this glossy black case looks almost identical to the phone without a case - the surface is smooth and reflective just like the actual screen, and the touch sensitive isn't degraded through the material.  it also wirelessly charges through the case without trouble.the results of combining these two products - the white ceramic s10+ with the black s-view cover - are impressive.  the case raises the back ever so slightly so that the camera bezels do not touch the surface it is laid upon.  and the black color blacks-out the white ceramic back so that you can maneuver through your day keeping a low profile - a white phone reflects more light and draws the attention of others much more than a black phone - so the case is camouflage for that gorgeous white ceramic.  even with the case installed, the subtle warm silver bezel is visible at the bottom, the power button, and the camera bezel - and this warm metal against the black case is super cool!so there you have it.  i'm sure others will write all about the latest technical goodies that are also included, but maybe this review proved helpful to someone interested in the visible aesthetics.  the ceramic white with the black s-view case is highly recommended.
just got my s10 plus today. opened it up and was looking at the lenses and theres bubbles under the glass.
product was opened beforehand and had a yellow sticker on the item......new is new and this was not new. it also had a bunch of spanish and i had to convert it to english so i believe i got an international version. definitely a way to do business since i notice many other people experienced the same issues.
love it, it took a really long time to arrive but once it did i fell in love
the camera quality blew my mind , and so bright, worth every penny.
awesome phone. i love it!
this is the best smartphone that has ever been made
excelent prodruct
the style of the phone
is there should have a clean plastic case include?
best samsung flagship.
ok, so i think thst this is a great phone, and while everyone's experience will be unique, i traded in my galaxy s9, so just a couple of things that stand out.  the camera on the s10e has some new cool features, and the image quality is a bit better than that of the s9.  it takes just a little longer to charge the s10e than s9 (using noot quick-charge).  i really enjoy the ultra-wide lens camera, that's something that lg been having for a long time, and i'm glad samsung picked up on that.  the finger-print sensor can be better, will see how it is down the road.  i got a supcase case (check the cnet's drop test article, supcase scored really well there).  and of course, the new wallpapers are amazing:)
i received my att samsung s10e march7th and set things up march 8th fully. i had a little bizarre problem setting up, but did a factory reset and this phone is awesome! i give full five stars. i was a two year owner of samsung s7 edge with knox setup and those that have this know how slow things can get. with s10e all problems gone! vanished! it is blazing fast. same apps. 6gbemory now. probably faster 128gb phone flash memory. reusing my 128gb samsung micro sd card. it's easily 10x faster and no delays compared to s7 edge. att was giving a very great deal on these with 2 year commitment. its physically smaller than s7 edge but bigger screen. fingerprint sensor is in logical place and i use it all the time. build quality is excellent. when i upgrade family, will be on these devices!!!

battery life. very nice. time will tell how soon it need battery replacement, something that's been a big issue for me with my iphones, how soon they seem to go bad.3. if you haven't had wireless charging before, you will love it. i almost never have to plug my phone in having wireless charging pads or stands wherever needed. the reverse charging is a nice option although i didn't get my free buds yet so haven't had a chance to try them out but i've had other wireless buds and they always seem to start having issues fairly quickly for the high cost. if you are single like me, the ability to charge another phone isn't all that helpful but for families it may be a really nice plus. it does also mean you have to be careful about the case you get if you want to make sure it works with this feature. ones that support wireless charging are not necessarily going to work for the reverse charging.4. lots of great camera options and of course, five cameras (3 on the back, 2 on the front). this was a big reason i got this camera, and it's a lot of fun to play with them, but see the cons for my experience with them. super slo mo video is also very cool to play with. coming from an older phone, the options here are a joy, particularly the pro mode. in the past i've had to use other camera apps to get even close to what the pro mode can do.5. android os and samsung's version in particular is awesome for power users like myself that love to tweak everything. coming from an iphone it's a joy to be able to customize my phone so much. i particularly appreciate the one-handed features when using a large phone like this (but see the cons list again).6. lots of security options in terms of how to protect your phone. face id is a fast way to unlock the phone but easily faked, so not very secure. i've had issues with it in the past as well when the lighting is not good. the new fingerprint scanner is supposedly very hard to fake and works in lots of conditions.7. plenty of space with 128 gig memory to start with, and it has microsd which is nice if you want to load up lots of music and video for a trip (not so much for everyday use). i also love that it still has a headphone jack. the ability of the phone to recharge headphones is nice, but there aren't many that will work with it yet and nothing sucks more than your bt headphones dying and not being able to plug in a backup set of normal ones.cons:1. the design of the phone is pretty blah and it's super slippery. you want to get a case on this thing asap. the sensitivity of it all the way up to the edges makes this even more important, trying to turn it from portrait to landscape without a case seems to always cause it to think i'm clicking on something. i really don't see it being usable at all without having at least a minimal case on to hold it with. also the plastic screen ""protector"" it comes with is not going to do much protecting and is the kind that is easily rolled on the sides when trying to get the phone in and out of cases.2. which brings me to con #2. the fingerprint scanner. this was touted as such a huge breakthrough but seems a step back to me from having used scanners on the outside of the case or in a button as they were on my iphone. first, there's nothing to help you feel for where to put your finger, no haptic feedback or anything to give you help with getting your finger in the right place other than the visual pseudo-button on the screen, and the messages that come up to tell you it couldn't read your print are so ridiculously tiny and hard to read. you have to press quite hard on the screen, maybe eventually i'll get the hang of it but right now it's constantly telling me to press harder. i've never had that issue with normal scanners. it also makes using glass protectors on the front far more difficult as many will render it unusable.3. for as much as the wide and tele lens are touted by samsung, the quality of the images you get with them are pretty sub-par. at best, you can get semi-decent photos outside in excellent light, but compared to the primary lens, particularly for indoor shots the difference is very obvious. likewise they talked about having a ""night mode"" that would rival the quality of the pixel 3, but it's nowhere close. the pictures are far too soft and clearly not using the kind of hdr that google is using in the pixel to produce such good low light shots. outside in bright light shots tend to have blown out areas still. i also get frustrated at how only the normal photo and video modes will allow you to use the wide and tele lens (pro and super slo mo for instance will not), and how much you have to let the camera control what's happening such as using scene detection (vs. being able to set the type of scene myself). granted it's still a big improvement having a pro mode at all, but there's still more i want to be able to do. they still seem to think throwing hardware at us will suffice without addressing the software side, but for top-quality photos, the pixel 3 with its one lens is still going to win out in many situations. likewise the additional front-facing lens for selfies. i'd much rather have had the wide-angle view the pixel 3 offers vs. using up space on the front just for a camera to help blur the background. do they even bother to ask users what they most want?  luckily the folks at moment support even these new phones with their great professional addon lens, so i'll be upgrading my kit for their new super-wide angle and tele lens as certainly the performance from the main lens with its adjustable aperture is quite excellent. but i'm glad at least to have the additional lenses built into the camera to use when i don't feel like carrying the extra lenses with me, as i usually don't in my daily routine. but if only google could deliver a phone that isn't sub-par on battery life as the pixels have been, they would probably pull even more customers like me over, but as much as i care about my photos looking awesome, i've had my share of having to carry battery chargers around all day to deal with phones that die out too quickly.4. as much as the os gives me some good one-handed options, the hardware design seems to completely ignore it. why are the buttons so freaking high on the phone?! i've used an s9 and don't recall it being this bad. the power button (which doubles as the camera button on a double press) is particularly frustratingly high. the volume toggle as well, virtually impossible to reach without using the other hand.5. there's still some things about the android/samsung os that i find baffling and frustrating. at times i get lost trying to find my way back because something i did sent me off somewhere else. a number of times i've ended up in the animoji section of the camera app and couldn't figure out how to get back to the regular camera. far too often it relies on dragging or other screen gestures when a simple menu option to switch screens would be so much more user friendly. likewise how confusing it is that the bluetooth setup shows me all these mac ids of devices i can't connect to. it's almost comical what that screen looks like in a large gym these days. why not just show me the ones i *can* connect to? it's definitely not always easy to use a really feature-heavy device like this and not sure i'd recommend it to less experienced users.6. likewise between all the stuff google wants to control and samsung loads on the phone, i feel like i'm turning over my entire lives to these companies privacy wise. i quickly switched it over to using duckduckgo for web searches and use other privacy features, but it's concerning how much access these big companies want to what you do on your phone. samsung does provide a vpn service on the phone you can use as well to help keep your activity secure, but do i trust they are not using that to track me? given what companies like facebook have done when people give them a phone number to enable 2-factor auth, i'm not sure i trust any of them anymore.7. price. we're in iphone range now with this phone. it's clear that samsung is justifying pushing the price up with additional hardware features like the improved screen, more storage, in-screen fingerprint scanner and extra cameras. some are definitely a step up, but others, like the scanner and sub-par cameras, not so much. some like the reverse charging may in time be more beneficial than it likely will be for most people initially.overall, this is still a really good phone. however, if you are happy with 64 gig, i'd probably recommend getting an s9+ and saving a good bit of money. there's really nothing on the s10+ that is so much improved that it's worth hundreds of dollars... and some things are a bit of a step backward imo. however if you really want 128 gig, this phone is worth the relatively small additional bump in price over an s9+ with comparable storage.
amazon had fast & safe shipping...kudos to them, they did their part. samsung created a great phone with this one. snappy os system, camera is great, battery seems good, i have been downloading and using the camera and battery is draining like any other phone under heavy use. i do believe that the battery on this unlocked version will be better than a carrier version...there is no bloatware running in the background. the screen is just...the best i have ever seen. size, i like the 10+ size, its big..i have gym shorts and when i sit...it's poking out the top big. decent weight (you know its there) so far so good.now, a couple things with the phone and the pre-order fiasco,1. the phone comes with a screen protector on it already from the factory, so save your money.2. it does not come with a sim card, depending on your situation, you may have to go to your carrier and ask them for a new sim card...because your old one might not be compatible. (i had to take it to sprint, they gave me a new sim and activated it)3. do not freak out at the little grey bar on the extreme right,(in the middle past the curve) bezel. those are not dead pixels, thats the mini menu/quick access thing. hold and drag left to show the menu.4. the earbuds situation, i pre-ordered this phone in late february, on this website. i saw an ad on here that said i would qualify for the earbuds. i called amazon, the rep said ok, he will call samsung and get the details. i said ok, he called me back later and said ""  log into the samsung shop and redeem for your earbuds "". he was right it worked, so download the samsung shop app, and put in your information and you have to send proof that your pre-ordered before march 8. i took a screen shot of my amazon page order details.ok, so thanks, and if your samsung, ill take a wireless charging pad if you got one laying around you dont need anymore.
i've been using the samsung s8 for the past two years without any major issues. so i decided to purchase the s10e since it was about the same price i paid for the s8. but after using the s10e for a few days, i don't like it as much. first off, the pixel density of the s8 is about 100ppi higher. some may not notice a difference, but i do. small text looks ""out of focus"" on the s10e, but is sharp and clear on the s8. also, the front camera ""hole"" is a constant distraction when using the phone.the second issue with the always on display does not turn off if the phone is in your pocket, and keeps using the battery. from what i've read, this is a ""know issue"" on all s10 models, as the proximity sensor does not work properly. on my s8, the always on display turns off in my pocket or if i place the phone screen-down on a table.lastly, i'm really missing the led notification light. all my previous samsung phones (s and notes) had the led notification, as it was easy to tell from a distance if there was a missed call, new message, or e-mail. but with the s10e there isn't a notification light that keeps blinking, so i'm always having to checked the always on display for new notification.at this point, i'll be returning the s10e, as it feels like a downgrade from my s8. even if i went with the regular s10, it would have a higher resolution screen like my s8, but would still be missing the led notification light and the always on display would stay turn on inside of a pocket using the battery. maybe i'll go with the s9, or lg g8 when it comes out.------------update:after owning the s8 for the past two years, i first got the s10e and didn't care for it, and exchanged it for the regular s10.i do like the s10 more than the s10e. but with that being said, it's not a huge upgrade from my s8, and is actually missing features.first off, the ultrasonic fingerprint reader on the s10 works about 50% of the time. i even registered my right thumb as finger 1-4, and it still has issues reading it. the face detection does work (in good lighting) but isn't as secure. what was best was the iris scanner on the s8/s9. it was fast, accurate and secure.next, there is no led notification light on the s10 series. this means you can't easily tell if you had a call or message by a flashing color light, and instead you are dependent on the always on display that you have to check. i really missed the led notification light when using the s10 and found myself always checking the phone for missed alerts.now for the good...the screen on the s10 is a modest step up from the s8. i'm not fond of the camera hole, but did get use to it. the cameras also took good quality pictures, and i'm glad to see a dedicated wide-angle lens (like my lg g5 had). call quality was good, signal reception seemed ok. battery life was better on the s10 than my s8.right now samsung is selling the s9 for under $350, so i may upgrade to that from my s8, since it still has the led notification light and iris scanner.
i am a straight talk customer making the big plunge from an iphone to an android. i expected to lose all of my stuff because of this change but was pleasantly surprised by the samsung s10's ability to back up all of that information. this was an easy transition to a great phone.
i have just received that phone yesterday. it is amazingly fast comparing to my old samsung phone. i have yet to discover all the features.phone came with fast charger, samsung headphones, charging cable, micro usb to c adapter, opening tool.  i was able to easily activate it with metro pcs. i took my old micro sim card of my old phone, made couple of cuts on the outside of that card i made it smaller to the size of a nano sim card required by samsung galaxy s10e.  i was done with activation it within 15 minutes. everything works perfect including calls over wifi.so far i am pleasantly surprised with this phone. with included adapter, i connected this phone with my old phone and transferred all my data and apps to new phone in less then 5 min.i have to admit that this phone feels a little bit slippery and in my opinion requires a case to handle it better.front screen protector feels extremely smooth so there are no fingerprints on it. it feels glassy smooth. amazing.now, when i'm writing this, i've had this phone for almost 5 days.  screen:from what i have seen so far, the camera and a video quality on this phone is superb, just like i read in various reviews.i recorder couple of video clips and when played on this phone i was blown away with how sharp and crisp the picture look like. my friend, when he saw that asked me if this was 4k display. it is so amazing.also, this display has really dark blacks and all pictures and video looks better on it then on my lcd monitor or my tv.  camera:camera has lots of features that will take few hours to explore. i love 2 lenses, wide and regular that allow you to capture everything you want. picture quality is amazing. photos taken with this phone look better then from my regular camera.this s10e has optical image stabilizer when shooting video. there are 2 options. stabilizing and smooth stabilization. both of them give you super smooth video. i will post few clip later.again, i was blown away but low light performance of this camera. i was taking pictures in very low light conditions and picture looked perfect. i can take much better low light pics then when using my regular camera.  battery:on my first day i was using it almost nonstop trying to learn all the features and battery lasted me all day. it was 23% at 8pm. there are great 3 battery saving modes that allow you to adjust battery consumption and your app power load. i posted a pic showing my battery at 35% and in most restricted power mode i have more then a day of battery left. with this extreme mode you still have access to your email, web, sms, camera and gallery. love this option.  finger sensor:finger sensor is on right side. once i scanned fingers i use to unlock it works 99% on first touch. it is fast and easy way to unlock your phone. super easy to use.  bixby:i think it will take a while to use bixby more frequently but i see potential in this samsung version of alexa.my old samsung phone had option of speech recognition in polish for typing. this one does not and this is a bit disappointing.i will post more updated as i learn more about his phone.manual has more then 200 pages and i really need to go through it to learn all the features.i've posted few pics taken with this phone as example of perfect camera quality.enjoy you phone. it is worth it.
i bought this phone and it came in its usual packaging but not factory sealed. just a yellow sticker. during setup, everything was in spanish and i switched it to english and followed through with the setup. even after setup, many apps were in spanish. i put my straight talk sim card in and nothing. i couldn't text, call, browse, etc. i'm pretty sure i was sent an international phone. i also kept getting a message that said ""open channel for bip"". i had no issues with my galaxy s9 plus. for $999, you'd think they'd sent the right product. it's a shame because the phone i ordered was beautiful but useless.
so i bought my phone from another seller who was prime eligible in order to save money on taxes (buying from amazon directly wanted me to pay almost $100+ making this phone over $850 for the 10e)the seller was very responsive and did give me the 10e like i ordered however, i belive this phone was intended for a mexico or south american market and not the north american market.i have cpu-z installed on my phone which allows me to examine the hardware on the phone and instead of getting the new snap dragon 855 processor this phone has samsung processor the exynos 920 processor which is anywhere from 5 to 20% slower depending on the applications used. it can even be slower than last years snapdragon 845 processor in certain video rendering tasks. this is incredible disappointing for me however it did come with a couple of items that did make it a little bit better to swallow such as a free 128gb microsd card and a free case (not sure if that's standard or not) which was a nice touch.let me be clear this is still a fantastic phone and a great upgrade from my lg g6. but i wish that i had the snapdragon phone instead of this exynos one just for longevity sake. the extra goodies though do make it worth it for me to keep the phone instead of exchange it and reordering from samsung directly. plus i don't edit videos on my phone directly so the weakest performance sku doest really affect me too much.i gave it 3 stars just becuase i felt a little decived for paying full price and getting the slightly inferior phone. i also have concerns if samsung will honor the us warranty coverage the product page advertised.overall just be careful who you buy from.
i had a few questions before per-ordering the ceramic white ceramic version of the samsung s10 plus that were difficult to answer using the marketing material alone.  in particular i was wondering about the physical appearance of the ceramic white s10 plus.  well, i received the phone now, so i thought i would drop into amazon and comment on my first impressions.  maybe someone else has similar questions, so hopefully this is helpful to someone.question:  does the metal band around the ceramic white version of this phone have a rose-gold tone?answer:  it does has the very slightest hint of pink in the metal.  but let me emphasize here that it is very subtle.  at first glance it looks silver with no color, but when examined closely a hint of warm color can be detected.  and let me also emphasize that it is beautiful!  the contrast against the pure ceramic white back and the clear glossy black front is perfect.  concern yourself no longer, this is the color to get.  also keep in mind that all other s10 models have the pure silver band, this is the only version that provides the slightest warm tone to the metallurgy.question:  what's the deal with the black samsung s10 plus s-view flip cover, is this official case worth it?yes, it is worth it.  this black case keeps the phone almost as slim and low profile as having no case at all.  the cover is translucent but appears opaque.  the s10 plus can detect when the cover of this case closes and then goes into aod (always on display) mode.  this allows the cover of the case to operate like a screen when desired (while still keeping core functionality locked).  when shut, this glossy black case looks almost identical to the phone without a case - the surface is smooth and reflective just like the actual screen, and the touch sensitive isn't degraded through the material.  it also wirelessly charges through the case without trouble.the results of combining these two products - the white ceramic s10+ with the black s-view cover - are impressive.  the case raises the back ever so slightly so that the camera bezels do not touch the surface it is laid upon.  and the black color blacks-out the white ceramic back so that you can maneuver through your day keeping a low profile - a white phone reflects more light and draws the attention of others much more than a black phone - so the case is camouflage for that gorgeous white ceramic.  even with the case installed, the subtle warm silver bezel is visible at the bottom, the power button, and the camera bezel - and this warm metal against the black case is super cool!so there you have it.  i'm sure others will write all about the latest technical goodies that are also included, but maybe this review proved helpful to someone interested in the visible aesthetics.  the ceramic white with the black s-view case is highly recommended.
just got my s10 plus today. opened it up and was looking at the lenses and theres bubbles under the glass.
product was opened beforehand and had a yellow sticker on the item......new is new and this was not new. it also had a bunch of spanish and i had to convert it to english so i believe i got an international version. definitely a way to do business since i notice many other people experienced the same issues.
