5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, so good.  It is very hard to tell that this phone is a refurbished phone and not new.  I received it last Thursday and have been busy installing updates, apps and accounts in order to switch over from my existing Windows phone.  I have not activated on my Verizon network but I have verified, by swapping my old phone's SIM card into the S7, that it could connect to the Verizon network in CDMA LTE mode.  Once I've configured it I'll need to go to a Verizon store, get a new SIM, and activate it.  Other than that this refurbished phone seems like it will work just as expected with a new phone.  I will update this review once the activation is complete and I've been able to put it to actual day-to-day use.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I believe this is going to be my best phone yet. It came in the time promised and it looks to be brand new. Setting it up and transferring my data was a breeze. I love the ""always on"" screen that shows the time and date as well as certain other information. Really a handsome phone that is the right size for me.The only reason I have not given it 5 stars is that I don't have my sim card yet, so I can't actually use it as a phone, just wi-fi. But I will have that installed soon and I imagine it will be wonderful.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Product works as a phone. Headphone jack does not. I don't have time to return it because I actively need a cell phone for business. I'd appreciate changing wording from ""Refurbished"" to ""used"" or ""broken"". Just so consumers are clear on what's up. ""Like new"" should be pretty clear and apply to things that are, yknow, like new. Thanks.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Really nice phone for the price! Everything on it is perfect, except when I try to play music through the aux cord in my car, it has a loud, annoying static sound that won't go away. I can bypass this though a bluetooth adapter, though, so it's not a huge issue, and it's the only issue I've had thus far. Everything else works amazing and it looks like new. Another minor issue was shipping. I ordered this phone last Thursday and paid extra for one day shipping, but the phone arrived the following Wednesday. The phone is nice enough that it wasn't a huge issue, but definitely don't pay extra for one day shipping or expect this phone to arrive in a hurry.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"The battery life on this is terrible, it last about 2 hours. the Operating system is about as slow as Christmas and apps quit on me faster then battery does. Will probably return, not worth the hassle. Not to mention risking what feels like first degree burns from the thing overheating in my hand.Pros:-Cute ability to let Google rule over everything-Android-Can cook eggs and the Waterproof-ness prevents that yoke from entering the phoneCons:-Low security-Heats up to the point where I thawed out two cavemen to show them this marvel of technology, they said it was dumb and used it to make fire-slow-battery dies faster then my last relationship(Star if you read this I miss you you)

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Whoever this phone belonged to before me (the seller) knew that this phone had an issue, that is why it was sold for such a cheap price. Yes it was a refurbished phone, BUT still with an ongoing issue. This phone requires a system update all day everyday, but once it is done, nothing reflects that update and then it asks for another update. It is a never ending request! I have to keep allowing the phone to update and reboot and I do not have another phone that I can use to send this one back. I can make and receive calls, text, etc. for the most part, but the last phone that I had was a decent phone, it just did not have enough storage space and a terrible camera, but it did not require updates every morning or every night! I need storage space and a great camera with great pictures. I am disappointed and I have NEVER done a bad review about anything that I received through Amazon! (I do understand that each seller is different, but this could cause issues in the future)

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Item was defective, screen broken, huge pink lines flickering before 90 day warranty was up, contacted company 1 day after 90 day warranty period which apparently starts when it was ordered, not received and would not help me out at all.I had not had the phone active for more than 60 days when this happened.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So glad I decided to purchase Amazon certified refurbished.The phone I received was like new and fully functional. No problems activating it to my Verizon account. Battery life lasts all day with medium use. Came with a Samsung quick charger. I couldn't be happier with the performance and quality of this phone.
            "
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I would not consider this a certified refurb. It came with generic charger that wasn't useable so I'm using a Galaxy S charger I had from another product. Phone charges to 100% but does not stay charged more than 12 hours even with very limited use, notifications and smart background off. Wish I had spend the extra on something more certain. ANY Certified Refurbished ELECTRONIC Item Ive purchased previously always came with a name brand charger and good battery life therefore I am disappointed.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am mostly please with the purchase. The phone looks great cosmetically and works great. Only problem is with the battery. The battery is not good and I would have rated this only 3 stars. I get about 6 hours of light use before phone's completely dead, 2 hr's to 3 hr's max if I'm talking on it and have the blue tooth earpiece connected . We have another S7 we purchased new about 18 months ago, and when configured identically and placed side by side with the one we purchased from Kiss Electronics we can see an obvious difference on remaining battery power within 10-15 minutes. However, I called Amazon customer service and explained the problem. They quickly offered to credit me $20 so I could purchase a new replacement battery, which I have ordered and will swap out with the bad one soon. So, I've raised my rating to 4 stars because of the incredibly responsive customer service response and my belief that a new battery will resolve my only problem with the phone. Lastly, the S7 battery replacement process looks to be a little more than just a quick swap out. It involves special tools, heat gun, etc (I suggest watching a YouTube Video before attempting this battery swap). I will update this review after I replace the battery.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"When we got the phone, the previous owner's information was still on the phone. That was bad enough, but now, after just 4 months, the phone has crashed and is completely dead. Even though the phone appears completely fine, hasn't been dropped, and hasn't been wet, Verizon employees said it was done. Unless this seller follows up and something changes, our recommendation is to avoid them.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"BEWARE-Phone aesthetically looks great.-Charge port is loose.-Unable to get rid of software update notification (run update and it still keeps coming back up every time.  Tried factory reset and didn't fix problem.-Battery life is very bad.  Complete discharge within normal conditions (very little usage) from 100% at 6am to 45% at 10am to 0% by 2:30pm.  Not possible to replace battery since it is a integrated battery / device.-Called customer service and they will issue a refund or replacement but I have to go without a phone until new one arrives after they received this defective one.-I have to go to Verizon to get a micro SIM (had to cut old one to fit GS7 nano SIM slot) for my old device just to send this one back, or go without a phone.UNFORTUNATE EXPERIENCE OVERALL.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was skeptical ordering. Was assured it would work on Verizon. Has Verizon logo on back. Hardest part was getting a SIM card cause it is an older phone and I had to drive over an hour to a Verizon corporate store on a busy weekend.  Husband loves it. Itâ€™s his first smart phone.  No complaints so far. Questions were answered quickly. Fast shipping.Def recommend this seller and this product.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This cell phone was available from a number of different sellers, with mixed reviews across the board, and almost the same pricing.  I opted to go with Dealfisher and  was very pleased with the entire order process.  See a ""seller review"" separately.  As far as the phone goes, I was a little bit hesitant at going with a refurbished unit, but it was almost $250 cheaper than purchasing new from Verizon.  I'm glad I took the chance.  The phone is to any non-technical examination brand new.  Not a scratch, rub mark or any other discernible indication that it has ever been used before.  It did NOT come with a sim card, or memory card, but that was clearly indicated in the product description.  What I did not know was that the Galaxy S5, that I was replacing, has a ""micro sim card"" and the Galaxy S7 (the new phone) has a ""nano sim card"".  They are NOT the same.  That's the bad news.  The good news is that my local Verizon store (NOT and authorized vendor, but a ""real"" Verizon store), installed a new nano card in a couple of minutes and then, since they weren't busy, cross loaded all of the contents from the old phone to the new...at NO cost!  It can't get better than that.  By the way, the memory card IS the same for both phones.  Hope you get the same great results I did.  Cheers...Ed B.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"The phone is missing the Verizon Voicemail app.  And spoiler alert you can't add it.  According to Verizon support it is something that has to be added when the phone is first configured.  Also per Verizon they say this means its not really a Verizon phone, its just a phone that will work on the Verizon network.  Ultimately what this all means is you can't tell if you have a voicemail, how many voicemails you have, who they are from or when they were left.  You have to dial the voicemail number and then listen to each message in its entirety and then check the info on the voicemail to get any info about it.  For someone who lives their life by their phone this is a no go.  If this would have been disclosed in the product description I would have picked another phone.

After-market accessories, charged very hot, screen had a light 1/3 section that jiggled, black colors were green, speaker cut in and out, mobile reception strength started out half of previous phone and decreased to near zero.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Update: after rebooting the phone 5 times and doing a system update I was finally able to use the fingerprint sensor to unlock my phone.

I received the phone and when I put the sim in I keep getting a notification that unauthorized actions have been detected.

I still get the same message. This phone is a piece of you know what. I am sending it back for a full refund.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"For what it's worth, I bought my phone from DealFisher and it was great. Battery is very strong and only one or two minor scratches that suggest this thing was hardly used. It was no trouble getting this phone switched over to my existing Verizon service. Last thing to note was that my package just included the phone and charger without any other extras. That's fine with me. Just happy I got a good one!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"So when I was initially looking to buy a new phone I knew that I didn't need the newest or shiniest phone so I decided to buy a phone that was a few generations back. But I debated about where to buy a used phone. I researched for a long time and went back and forth with a lot of websites and Amazon had the cheapest price, which made me both happy and a little bit warry. But I decided to go with the phone on Amazon, I choose my seller carefully to a one that had good reviews and a high quantity of reviews. When it came the phone had no defects and looked brand new! It didn't have a  sim card (but I knew it wouldn't) All in all great phone great deal! I waited to write my review for a couple of months just to make sure. So I highly reccomend buying a used phone.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect quality and flawless performance. I had a brand new Galaxy S7, which I lost after about 6 months of use, and I decided to replace it with this refurbished S7. Because I had been using the exact same (but brand new) phone just prior to using this refurbished, I can undoubtedly confirm that this performs the same, and it looks and feels brand new as well. No scratches, no dings, not even any dirt or dust in the speaker grill etc. At first I was hesitant to purchase a refurbished phone, but all my worries were for no reason with this seller. Thank you!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this phone to replace my aging S4 that was still working but getting tired. The S4 was in an otter box all it's life and had a few battery replacements since i bought it new. Back in those days smartphones were free when you signed a 2 year contract so I had a bit of sticker shock when I went phone shopping. I'm over 60 and retired, I just don't need the latest gadget filled cell phone.I read all the reviews for this S7 phone on Amazon and found a wide mix of comments from junk to like new condition. The thing that sold me on this one is that Amazon certified it with this statement ""A Certified Refurbished product has been tested and certified to work and look like new, with minimal to no signs of wear, by a 3rd party distributor""Certified to work and look like new from Amazon's description means to me I could return the phone if I was not completely satisfied with it's condition. The 3rd party distributor for my phone was Kiss Electronics.I live in SoCal and ordered the phone with Prime 2 day delivery, to my surprise it arrived the very next day!first Impressions,I opened the prime box to find a generic phone box inside. When I opened the phone box I found the phone, a wall charger, and a phone number for Kiss electronics customer support, that's it. No manual, no release key for the sim card and no instruction manual. I was soon encouraged by the like new external condition of the phone and I saw what appeared to be a factory original peel off plastic screen cover on it.  I plugged it into the provided Amazon marked charger to find the battery was completely discharged. I found a safety pin to release the sim card holder and quickly realized my old S4 Verizon sim card was way to big to fit. The next day I went to the Verizon store and they happily supplied me with a nano sim card. I asked them if they could transfer all my old contact info from the old sim to the new one and I was told that is not possible. Now that I know about the sim card data transfer problem, I would have used google in advance to back up all my data first before going to the Verizon store. Oh well, I transferred all my data the old fashioned way, hey I'm retired, who cares.After getting the new nano sim card installed I was ready to try out the phone.I turned the phone on to update my contacts, then decided to check for Android operating system updates. I found that it was currently running Marshmallow 6.0.  I updated the first, then the second, then the 3rd. On and on for a total of about 7 different operating system updates, it took a few hours to complete all the upgrades. It updated all the way to Oreo v. 8.0. This is when I realized this must be a new old stock phone that has not ever been operated or used before.I had read that manufactures (like Samsung) often have many brand new phones that are earmarked for their warranty exchange programs. I suspect these phones were new phones that were not needed by the manufacture and were sold at auction to various electronic device distributors (like Kiss Electronics)I have had the phone now for about a week. After removing the bloatware and configuring it the way I want it, I am very happy with it. I would highly recommend this phone for anyone on a budget or whoever doesn't need the latest and greatest cell phone on the market. I rate my entire experience with Amazon and Kiss Electronics A+

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Aside from a little rash around the charging port from being used, the phone was like new. No scratches, no issues. phone been working great so far. Bought it for my wife, I may order myself one now.UPDATE: 09/12/18I purchased this to replace my wife's Galaxy S5 (I am still using mine).  Since she bought it I have not been happy with her call quality.  I have a hard time understanding her unless she speaks deliberately and clearly.  5 months later I realize that we are not being connected using the HD Voice option on Verizon phones. The ""Advanced Calling"" options are not present on this phone.  I spent hours with VZW Support and Samsung support to no avail.  Samsung told me that a phone that has been unlocked does not have these features.  Verizon says that this must not have been a Verizon phone and that's why it is not available.  The phone I bought from Deal Fisher was supposed to be a Verizon phone and was not listed as an unlocked phone.  Ultimately I am overly disappointed.  My S5 has way better call quality and now I am hesitant to replace it with another one off of Amazon.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Phone did not have software compatible with Verizon and so cannot be activated. Despite multiple attempts to factory reset and to update the software through Verizon's software tool on my computer, I cannot use the phone with a new SIM card from Verizon. Since it was sold as a Verizon phone, that renders it essentially useless to me. After spending 2 hours on the phone with Verizon tech support, following by 2 hours of my own time attempting to reset the phone, I'll be returning this for a refund. I still have no phone, after waiting over a week for this one--an enormous waste of time for a useless device.My options now include rolling the device and waiting another week to get a new phone from Amazon/this seller, or switching to another seller and phone on Verizon. Either way, I'm left without a working device for another week.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been a Samsung user since 2012, and over the course of 6 years I've had the galaxy S3, Galaxy, S4, Note 5, and this phone (S7). I'm not sure if it's the phone's status as certified refurbished, but this is the laggiest phone with the shortest battery life of any Samsung I've ever had. I probably charge this 4x a day, using it from about 10am to 10pm. The functionality is all right, as it hasn't fully frozen yet, but even texting causes a lag. Maybe it's just the device I received, though, bc this doesn't seem to be many people's experience?

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This phone does what I need. It isn't so large it can't be put in a pocket, which is important to me. I put a Zagg screen protector on it and have it in a case and with a bit of luck it will last a couple of years. The cost to replace with a refurbished was about the same as I anticipated spending on repairs. Unfortunately, modern phones with water resistance include glues that are difficult to remove to make a repair a self-service option unless one is truly determined.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Four month's into owning what I thought was a decent phone, it has turned into a brick.  Listening to music last night I heard a peculiar zip like sound and the music stopped.  I knew it was fully charged, but it wouldn't respond to any button pressing.  I tried plugging it in this morning with no effect.  Later my screen lit up with nothing but static.  I'm not sure what  to replace it with.  New phones are prohibitively expensive.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"We decided to purchase an S7 for my wife (the year is 2018) because her iPhone 6 crapped out at the 1st sign of water. She saw how mine has been with us since our wedding day in reliability, functionality, so we decided to get a refurbished on Amazon since they don't make them anymore. She loves it, although there's a learning curve coming from iPhone, it works great and the battery life is like it was new. Were running these bases boys into the ground.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"We were so sad when my husband fatally crunched his relatively new (to us) Samsung Galaxy S-7 cell phone - right after we had ordered a new case for it.  We were thrilled the KISS electronics could replace it with a refurbished phone at a reasonable price.  We have now restored all of the features that were on the old phone and life is GOOD! Thanks, KISS!!
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was an upgrade phone for me, and I really like the phone. It has been easy to use, the battery life is wonderful (my old phone wouldn't hold a charge throughout the day anymore). The price was great, considering I was looking at phones for three-to-five hundred dollars. Very similar to my old Samsung phone, so easy to figure out some newer features.
            "
3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have friends with the same phone,  and even running just the factory installed apps my battery life was terrible compared to theirs.  I ended up buying a replacement oversized battery and opening up the phone and replacing it. Kind of a pain, but that's life when you buy refurbished stuff I guess.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Was not notified that the device was rooted, the whole reason why I was sticking to Samsung is to use the Samsung pass and pay, did not even bother inquiring about having full functionality on the Samsung.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"WeDeliverWireless - phone came damaged there are small cracks in the screen and the area where you plug it in to charge has most of the paint around it scratched off, when I purchased this phone before it was from SikkSound did a great job, the phone came in a flawless conditionEDIT: The phone no longer works due to ""moisture detected"" and is unable to charge

2.0 out of 5 stars,"We received this phone with a poorly placed screen protector that had dust stuck under it. Upon peeling it up we found the screen scuffed, and the home button worn completely down and scratched. Disappointing, especially considering shipping took a week.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Few scuffs and scratches but it was refurbished so no big surprise. Phone was completely dead so I put it on the charger. It started to charge for less than a minute and the charging box made a really weird noise then it popped and stopped working. The phone went off and came back on by itself. I guess it was a problem with the charger because I've had no problems with the phone since I started using my old charging box.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've ordered a number of used cell phones and had to send a few back. The ones from Prime Mobility have always held up and outlasted any others! This S7 was great. Amazing condition and everything synched up right away after putting my SIM in. Battery life has been good as well. Will always go to Prime Mobility storefront first!!
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"A refurbished phone that looks new.  I upgraded from an S4 and the speed of the S7 is much better along with 16 more GB.  The colors are crisp and I love the ""push the home button twice"" feature that takes you directly to the camera.  Great phone!
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Seems to work pretty well, been using this for about 4 months now and it hasnt been slowing or breaking down so far. Comes with charger but the adapters kind of a knock off, it works fine but of course its not as good as the original fast charging adapter. Nice of them to apply a hard plastic screen protecter since there us a very and ever so slight crack on the screen but pretty unnoticeable when using it but I had to remove the protector since it made the touch screen less sensitive and can barely activate any button. Also overtime the battery may drain alil faster, I try to restart my phone every once a week or turn off battery saving when Im home to lessen the problem. Overall good price and works well!
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this phone about a week ago and so far, I have been very impressed with it. It came rather fast and sooner than expected. When I took the phone out of the box, it looked brand new with no scratches or obvious imperfections. The phone started right up and the screen looked perfect. Overall, I'm very impressed with this phone and would greatly consider buying another phone from ths company in the future.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Out of this box this phone was almost like new. Just needed to get a sim card from Diamond Wireless and everything works like new. Functionality works as expected and the S7 is great phone overall. This is a great product and even though a couple models old, performs admirably in comparison with all of the newer phones.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I managed to get my old phone switched to this phone with out a problem but I believe the touch screen is not right. It randomly shows as if I'm clicking all over, send random gibberish and opens crazy apps. I tried powering down and can't touch power button since the touch screen shows as if I'm touching randomly all over the screen. It's extremely slow and glitchy where apps just start flashing and close. I can't type a text with out having to hit some spots in multiple areas and tack out letters not really typed. Last night it was at 6% battery and after sitting on my night stand charging for 2 hours was only up to 12%
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"OK I can't really afford phones, I have Page Plus and need unlocked phones. I had an S3 and the highest I could afford was an S7.

            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a much more fiscally sound purchase than a Galaxy S8 from the carrier. I had some reservations about it being refurbished and worried the the carrier would give me trouble when I got it activated, but everything has been just fine.  :-)

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was a little concerned ordering a phone online, but it was a great experience.  Arrived Timely.  Looks brand new.  No wear and tear at all.  The battery is so much better than my Note 4.  I do miss the camera on my Note 4, but still good quality pictures.  I actually like the smaller size.  Fits in my pants pocket and it is much easier to deal with on a daily basis.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"No problems.  Always look at ratings for the refurbisher you order from.  My refurbished s7 has performed like new for a fraction of the cost of a new phone.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First-time used phone buyer here. I read a lot of reviews before buying a refurbished Galaxy S7. Most were negative, but I took a chance anyway. I'm only one week in on this purchase but so far, I'm very pleased. The only indications that this isn't a brand new phone are there's a bit of dust/crud in the charging port, and the after-market charger vs. a Samsung-branded charger. Otherwise, it seems to be in perfect condition. I did have to do several software updates back to back, but I don't think that's unusual.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Worth every penny, the screen wasn't scratched, looks like brand new, I like the new features of the S7.  Upgraded from an S5, such a difference

5.0 out of 5 stars,"My refurbished samsung galaxy 7 came flawless, and, after inserting Consumer Cellular sim card, and 64 gig storage , and learning my new phone, it does some amazing things, and, takes cool photo's and videos on voice command.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Arrived on time and in excellent condition.  I installed a separately-purchased Verizon SIM, contacted Verizon for activation assistance and was up and running less than 20 minutes later.  I should also add that the battery works as though it had been replaced and the case is free from any signs of wear.  Excellent value.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm honestly blown away at this phone. I ordered it expecting the worst, despite the great reviews. I have had zero issues with my phone in the 2 weeks that i got it. The only thing that i questioned was the fact that i had to do 4 system updates, but once it got caught up everything was great. The phone looks and performs as if it were a brand new phone.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Screen is in near excellent condition (one miniscule scratch you have to look for). Back has expected wear from a cheap case.  Only real concern is whoever had this phone before obviously hadn't heard of gently plugging something in (paint scratched off in several areas around charge port area).  Overall though for a refurb and less than half what I paid for this model new last year, not too shabby!
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Came on time. Came in prime condition. - The phone itself is absolutely excellent. I began using it every day, it even has made my life at work far easier. It counts my steps with Samsung Health, and is helping me to stay healthier. Great choice. Great smart phone!
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"It's been just over 3 months since I bought the phone, and already the charger port is finnicky and a pain. I will add, I only charge when the battery is low and never overnight. If the phone isn't held at a specific angle, it will not charge. Should have just bought the s8 from Verizon directly.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The only signs of wear are the witness marks from the previous owner's case and a scratch on the home button. The button and fingerprint reader work fine. The screen is perfect. Battery seems pretty good. Processor is pretty quick. I did have to go to the Verizon store to get a nano sim card as my existing sim card didn't fit (this was free & painless). Perfect buy for those that aren't cool with spending $600+ on the newest smartphone.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"There is something wrong with the phone, it doesn't always charge, and it when it does it doesnt always go to fast charging mode, other than that its a nice phone but i wish to have it fixed.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Our second mistake.  We purchased this phone after making things mistake once before.  We purchased from another amazon seller hoping for a more successful experience.  Again, the phone came with an AT&T symbol on the back.  Uh oh. This phone was more dinged up and in worse condition than the first phone we purchased. We took the phone to a Verizon store to put on our plan.  It didn't work.  The phone will not work on a Verizon line.  They tried to help us sincerely, but to no success.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Looks and functions like new, at a fraction of the cost from Verizon.  And I don't see any issues with the battery life either.

Other than that its looks like a brand new phone.I upgraded from a note 3, so I did have to change my sim card to a smaller format, so if your replacing an older phone just something to be aware of. Verizon changed my sim card for free, so wasn't an issue.At first felt tiny compared to the note 3, but I adjusted in few days. I am happy with my purchase.

I tried this Verizon version of the phone for a Verizon line and it had a problem unlocking from the home screen. Three times it just wouldn't unlock and I had to do a complete system wipe and reboot. I picked up a second Verizon version of the phone from a big box store and after a few days of use it too became stuck in an endless loop when I tried to unlock it. I am starting to think the Verizon version of this phone has some issue with unlocking.

However, after the 3 month warranty from DealFisher was up, not even a week afterwards, the phone turned off while I was asleep, the phone on the charger, and never turned on again.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Was leery of buying given the horror stories of vendors with Amazon.  Happy to report, no problems (yet) after several weeks.  Verizon mailed me a free SIM card (no need to buy one) and I installed a 64 GB ram card along side it for a few more bucks.  Why buy a highly fragile S8 for twice the price when you can get this one?  It came new in the box.  Did not have original charger, other than that just fine.  Might buy another one.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"While all functions of the phone work as advertised, the battery life of the phone is so poor that it absolutely eclipses every other possible positive quality of this. Im currently getting only 6 hours of battery life worth only one hour of Screen On Time nested within the same time. This means that if i leave my house for drinks at 8pm, my phone will be basically dead by the time bars close and i wont be able to call an uber or even use google maps /maps to walk back to an apt or my house. Every time the screen is on the phone loses more than one percent per minute, even as the battery manager says it has hours left.  I heard great things about the phone and battery life in particular and I know that it may be due to the fact that its refurbished or but its so distracting and such an inconvenience that I dont think it can be honestly used in a day-to-day environment. I have just contacted the company responsible and will amend my review if the issue can be quickly and adequately resolved.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Four stars since the first one was very defective out of the box. It would reboot every few minutes. They obviously do not check these phones very thoroughly. They were both in perfect cosmetic shape.  The phone its self is a great phone. Good feel, weight etc. the screen is amazing and the camera is far better than my 5S was in low light. The only negative for me was the removal of the IR emitter. I used that a lot on my 5S.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The refurbished Galaxy S7 phone I purchased from BuySPRY looked and performed like new with no cosmetic defects at all. I received the phone 4 days after ordering and the seller sent a follow up email the day after delivery to make sure I was happy. Took it to Verizon the same afternoon I received it and Verizon activated it with no problems. Battery life is great.  It took 22 minutes to download my contacts, pictures, and apps from an older model Galaxy phone. I used quite a lot of Google searches to help me customize the phone the way I wanted. I love this phone. I looked at an S8, but for my needs, the few extra, and much more expensive,  bells and whistles weren't worth it.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"The phone arrived in perfect condition, without any signs of use. I'm really happy about taking this chance so far.I'm knocking off one star because the ""relevant accessory"" wall plug charger it came with does not support Samsung's Fast Charge - it's labeled as supporting 2v at 5A only. The original Samsung charger supports variable voltage/amperage combinations up to 15 watts. It's not a huge deal compared with the savings over buying the phone new or even getting refurbs from Verizon. I ordered a Quickcharge-compatible wall plug by Aukey on Amazon for 15 bucks. It's also possible that other sellers may include a fast charger.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had a Verizon LG G4 on Straight Talk and I loved it. However, it finally succumbed to the dreaded boot loop effect that LG is currently being sued for. I was looking at a V20 from LG but I read that it, too, was part of the class action law suit and as far as a refurbished G6 for about $40 more, well, sorry, LG, but you've pissed me off now.I started looking at alternatives, and it came down to the HTC 10 or a refurbished Samsung Galaxy S7. After much searching and reading reviews, I settled on the S7. There were several vendors offering them, and I went with DealFisher because they had the ""fulfillment by Amazon Warehouse"" label. Amazon is pretty picky, so I figured they'd be held to a higher standard than these other 3rd party vendors. I paid an extra $8 for next-day shipping.Package arrived on time, in a generic box with an aftermarket charger and USB cable. The phone itself was in excellent condition for a refurbished model. There are 3 small, very light scratches on the otherwise flawless glass on the front. I didn't notice them when I first got the phone, so it could be a result of sitting in my pocket with my keys (screen protector is on the way). There are signs of wear on the plastic bezel around the camera lens, and whatever it is that covers the flash and IR sensor (I read it's some kind of polyurethane coating and shows scratches easily but doesn't effect the functionality) has several marks on it. Everything else on the phone looks brand new. I'm using a Supcase case for it and it fits perfectly.As far as the phone itself, I really like it. Fast and smooth, camera is very good, low-light shots are the best I've ever seen on a phone. the screen quality is amazing. I like watching 4K videos on YouTube just so I can bask in the S7's pixel density goodness! It's eye-candy.I like the size, it's not too big and not too small. Bluetooth works well and pairs with my devices just fine. Audio sounds good and is plenty loud enough, in both earphones and speaker. One thing that irked me about the G4 was no native FLAC support. The S7 plays them just fine with no need for a 3rd party paid-for app like Poweramp. UPDATE: Does not play M4A audio files, so back to Poweramp.My G4 had a pretty finicky battery that would rarely get me through the day. The S7 seems to be much better in this regard. Also, the G4's lock screen would randomly come on all the time, and I don't have that issue at all with the S7 (I disabled the Always On Display feature).My G4 never received updates and it irked the crap out of me. I guess it had something to do with being a Verizon phone using a Straight Talk SIM card. One thing I had to do with the S7 was to get a new SIM card, since it uses a NanoSIM, not a MicroSIM. Surprisingly, upon connecting to the Verizon network it showed an update available and now I have Android 7.0 on my new S7.Time will tell just how durable this refurbished model is. If anything goes wrong, I'll update my review.Bottom line: For just over $230, it's a very nice deal for what is still a great phone that doesn't seem dated to me at all. I like it.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you get what you ordered, this is a really nifty phone.  When I decided to upgrade from my 2.5-year-old Galaxy Core Prime, I researched Samsung's flagships back to the S4, and decided the S7 is where they finally got all the changes right.  Great screen, camera, plenty of memory plus expansion slot, runs android 7, and oodles of options, settings, and customization.  The fingerprint unlock is a nice feature.  To me, this phone is also the perfect size, and will still fit in a normal pocket.Only cons so far: finding a screen protector that fits may be difficult, and the notification LED is smaller and dimmer than I am used to, making it hard to notice from a distance.It took me two tries to get the proper phone, however.  There are numerous third-party vendors all selling under this same product description, and I surmise there may be some tension as to what counts as a ""refurbished"" item.  The product description seems to indicate minor defects are acceptable.  Amazon's definition seems to indicate it should be repaired, cleaned, and essentially remanufactured to original, like-new specs.  Now, I have purchased refurbished on Amazon before with great results: A couple Samsung WiFi cams that were as good as new, and a DSLR, refurbished by Nikon USA itself, that was stunningly immaculate.  Alas, the first phone I received did not meet that standard, and was more what I would consider used but decently well taken care of (light glass scratches, dirt/corrosion in speaker and microphone ports).  It was also the wrong model, G930U instead of V, and had an ESN that Verizon could not recognize and activate.  No SIM card for me!  That last bit, of course, was the deal-breaker.Luckily, I had selected an Amazon-fulfilled item, so return and refund was of course fast and painless.  I repurchased from a different seller, also Amazon-fulfilled, and the only one who could deliver before the weekend.  I then timely received a pristine S7 that truly exemplifies what I would call refurbished or remanufactured, and am most pleased.  The short extra wait to get it totally right was well worth it.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought two of these refurbished Galaxy S7's.  I've only had them less than a week.  My wife's appears to be working well, but mine hangs up and needs a system reset several times a day.  This happens when it is idle for a length of time - several hours.  Seems OK if it is on a charger, but if left overnight off the charger it is unresponsive in the morning and needs the system reset.  When it comes on it still had battery life two nights, but the battery was at 0% another night.  Sometimes it hangs up during the day after being idle a few hours, even with a nearly fully charged battery.  Looks like I'll have to send mine back.Also, I have a hard time typing on that touchscreen keyboard - seems I have to backspace once for every 2-3 characters I try to type.  But in fairness, my grandkids seem to have far less difficulty.  Maybe I'll get accustom to it.UPDATE:  The day I wrote that review, I arranged to return the bad phone and buy a new one.  But I did not send it back right away.  That was about a week ago and I haven't experienced the problem since.  The S7 had required a couple system updates - perhaps they fixed the problem.  I've decided to retain the phone since then.  I'll leave the score as is.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I actually bought an unlocked S9 from this group and it works great. Got a 20% off Amazon like one day thing, so it was very cheap and that was why I did it but in thrall of all the hype. BUT, I had to give up my S7 I had gotten from Verizon for about six months to my wife as her old S5 finally bought the dust.I gotta tell you I really loved the S7 having come from an S5 back in August of 2018. Essentially, an S7 is an S5 on steroids with a better OS updated to Oreo in like October 2018 so recent.  The S7 is all about substance over form. The S7 in some ways is the last of the purely functional phones with a hard button. Samsung reached a peak with this phone. They essentially fixed all the ""issues"" they had with the S5 (plastic) and S6 (glitchy not polished ideas) and created a nice looking decent phone with a good camera, water resistance and a fast chip inside.  Ever since, for the S8 and S9 all they did was make em prettier and faster with bells and whistles.  The glass backs on the S8's and 9's are just another thing waiting to break. You better get a good case. They are slick in your hand too. But that screen is nice I must admit, but it is obvious that the new phones are all about form first substance second. It must be prettier and more flashy and oh by the way, it is very fast.But we are talking about the S7 and it is a very good phone for the average user who isn't going to play shooter games and doesn't need the latest, greatest and flashy. The S7 is not slow.  It s a highly functional phone that is water resistant (IP68), pretty darn fast built like a tank (metal), with unconnected fast charging and with a very decent camera. I loved it. I love its size in a hand. It fits perfectly in pockets whereas the S9 is long.  Not a biggie..until you bend over in jeans. And I am not too sure I am totally sold on these curved front glass on the S8's and S9's. I have already cracked one tempered glass screen protector because of the little pretty curved glass front. I never had a problem on my S5 or the S7. Apparently, this is common. The S7 is a little solid brick (still pretty) has a nice solid protective metal bezel and back and with a screen protector is good to go always. I have lately picked the old S7 up off the charger and noticed right away how comfortable it was in my hand remembering it fondly. The S9 is a great phone, but I miss the S7's pure functionality as a practical necessary device that ""fit"" in so many ways.  I may try to see if the significant other will trade me. She does like that Lilac back on the S9...So, I promise you if you are an Android person over 50 and just want a nice functional fast reliable phone that still looks good without a case, go with one of these and save yourself around 500 bucks. You won't regret it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"This phone locks up (unresponsive) far more than my Galaxy S5 ever did. It seems to do it at the most inconvenient times too like when I am trying to use the camera....the camera is great and I love the features but I could NEVER use the phone as my go to camera for the lag reasons.Or take today, I missed 2 incoming calls (it never even showed incoming) and then when I tried to call VM the phone basically locked up. I was finally able to respond to a text but this thing lags even when typing!Even after I rebooted...which sometimes takes 90 seconds for me to initiate when it gets into lag more, it was slow after the reboot!It's unreal. I think this is my last Galaxy.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"The phone looks perfect. It came with an off brand charger that does not seem to charge it, but that is not a big deal to me, as I have chargers that do work.  This did not come with ear buds either, which is also not a big deal to me but may be for someone else.  It took a full week to get delivered which took way to long.  Amazon has rarely taken that long.  Once I finally received this phone, I did the smart switch from my Samsung s5 to this s7. That was easy and worked perfectly.  I got everything set up and it all worked great.  So I finally switched my sim card and ready to make calls.  That's when everyone I talked to on the phone said they had a hard time hearing me.  They can't hear during the call unless I use the speaker phone.  Since it's not always feasible or appropriate to be on speaker this is a huge issue. Calling Amazon tech support I was told to install any updates or reset the phone to factory settings.  Neither of those things worked.  With regret, I will have to find another option.

The J7 while nice, didn't have the camera as the Note 5.I opted to try a refurbished Samsung S7. You would never know it wasn't brand new.  For less than $270 I've got a flagship handset, with an incredible camera and expandable storage. I highly recommend expandable storage if you enjoy taking pictures and loading mp3 files.I often drop my phone and rougher than most...so I couldn't justify the cost of an S8 or the newer S9 model phone. I'm very happy with the S7 and glad I took a chance on a refurbished item.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I give the product 5 stars, but the delivery was all over the place.  It finally arrived a couple of days late.  Who knows what happened, but the package arrived in excellent condition, so the extra routing did it no harm.  The Cell phone is like brand new.  It is a beautiful phone and my wife loves it.  In fact, after a few days of use, we like it so much I ordered one for myself.  AND GUESS WHAT?  It to has gotten lose in route, can you believe it?  I keep getting apologies for the lateness and when I track it it seems to be zigging and zagging its way to my address.  Never had this problem before when ordering PRIME from Amazon, weird.  I do not mind it come days late if it is in the same condition as the phone my wife received.  I would buy it again.  I liked the S8 and S9 but the roll over screen appears to be too sensitive for me.  My kids have these and you cannot pick it up without setting something off.  This S7 can be bought in the EDGE model but I prefer the standard screen.  The fact it is water proof (? resistant) and dust proof is a plus.UPDATE:  I liked this phone so much I ordered on for myself.  And guess what?  It too seemed to have gotten lost en-route.  When I did received it the packaging was fine, just a late delivery.  Also, I had assumed this was a Factory Refurbished, like the one I bought for my wife, but it came in a different product package and without the Refurb. stickers.  The phone looks like new but has a warning on the inside saying that it only has a 60 day return warranty, as opposed to the 90 day warranty of the Cert. Refurb. models?  So far the phone is working flawless and is like new -- I would guess it is actually a new phone, except it came with a Nokia charge cable, and a small transformer charger that is not from Samsung.  I have found a flaw, the headphone plug is crap.  You have to hold the plug in with pressure or it will not work.  For me?  I don't care about that because I never use headphones.  Everything else looks like new.  I have marked my calendar for the 60 trial, because that is what it is, for me.  Both of these phones came through Amazon Prime and say the supplier is Samsung, so I am assuming they both came from the same distributor, but the difference in packaging says otherwise?  We will see.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned a lot of phones throughout the years and this is the worst phone I have ever owned, Period ! I have mostly owned Motorola phones up until my nearly new Moto Z Play was accidentally submerged at the lake while putting my new boat in at the dock. At that point I decided I needed a phone that was water proof and this was suggested by a sales person at my local Verizon store. I currently owned a 10"" Galaxy Tablet and it was OK so didn't think twice about buying a Samsung Phone. Well, it was a huge mistake and I noticed almost from the beginning how short the battery life was and also how slow and sluggish the phone seemed to be compared to my Moto Z. At first it was tolerable but it just seemed to get worse, slower and more sluggish and the battery life after only a year is at a point to where I can barley make it through a full day a work and I find my self having to plug the phone in throughout the day just to get by. I did go through some steps on Google to try and speed the phone up and free up resources but this only helped a little and the battery life is just a deal breaker. The other issue is the phone is so damn fragile, I dropped it for the first time the other day, and even in a protective case the back completely shattered. I dropped my preious model Motorola phones countless times and other than a slight mark or blemish the phones were absolutely fine. So after only a little more than a year of use,  I now find myself needing to purchase a new phone due to its less horrible battery life, glass-jaw like build quality and piss poor performance and it will certainly not be another Samsung !!!

4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a solid phone in very excellent condition, and the price was great.It's still pretty tied to Verizon - you have to do quite a bit of manual setup to get it to work properly with other carriers (I had to call T-Mobile to have them reset some settings). I also get some annoying notifications about the SIM card not being from Verizon when I restart the phone.
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge have a common defect where the rear camera glass cover will spontaneously shatter. There are quite a few reported cases of this online, and Samsung is as of yet not acknowledging it as a manufacturing defect. Because of the design of the Galaxy S7, it is virtually impossible to repair this yourself, and in order to have it fixed you have to go without a phone for over a week after shipping the phone to Samsung, paying them to repair it, and waiting for them to ship it back. In my case the rear camera glass cover shattered while sitting on my desk, and there are numerous other reports of similar events (as crazy as that sounds). Samsung Support is unhelpful and denies that this issue has been previously reported, despite evidence to the contrary.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I decided to try something new for a change and purchased a Samsung Galaxy S7. It took me awhile to get used to the new software of an android phone and all the features that the S7 has to offer. I found the S7 to be overly complicated and it took me a lot longer to complete my endeavors with the S7 compared to an iPhone. In addition, I have found my Galaxy S7 has constantly froze and forces me to close applications. In my opinion, I think that iPhone is better than Galaxy because of the simplicity that iPhone offers.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Keep in mind that I only got the phone today so this review doesnt cover long term issues.Condition: It looks new and has no damage what so ever. Now it might not have the shine or feel of a new phone, but I put it under strong light looking for any signs of damage and I found none. Touch screen is perfect and all the buttons work. I'm a little worried that the home button might fail in time (it does feel a little weird) but for now its responsive so no complaints. The phone also has a Verizon logo at the back.Packaging and delivery: I dont have prime. I ordered this on Monday afternoon and I got it on Saturday. Not bad. The shipping box had the protective air bubbles and all. The phone does NOT come with the original packaging. As the case with most refurbished products it comes in a generic box. It had a changer and a short USB cable but no headphones (bummer). It also doesnt have the user manual but who reads that.The phone takes a nano sim and I micro SD. I had to replace my sim at the Verizon store and they added me to the network no problem. I'm not sure if this phone works with other networks but it does have setup guide for non-Verizon carrier. The battery doesnt seem as bad as some reviews are saying, but then again I've had my S5 for almost 3 years so anything will feel like an upgrade.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"The screen has lots of minor abrasions which make it extremely prone to retaining many fingerprints and oils. The earpiece is all scratched up (the black paint is chipping off of it a lot), and the home button has a big chunk taken out of the middle of it.  The corners are also pretty dinged up and the charging port is filthy as though it wasn't ever cleaned out with alcohol as it should have been - I cleaned the charging port myself when the phone failed to charge at first.  Cleaning it did the trick.  The power button is finicky and doesn't always function on the first press.  The microphone and speaker holes are also somewhat dirty right out of the box.  The phone still functions just fine aside from these points, however, and it seems to still have its waterproof properties.  The SIM card tray is perfectly intact as it should be, and there are no scratches in front of any of the cameras, luckily.  The last owner of this phone certainly didn't go out of their way to keep it clean or take care of it with a protective case or even a screen protector.  Adding a screen protector does help with the scratches that are all over the screen, at least.  You get what you pay for I guess, but I am mostly happy with the phone so far simply because it is surely an upgrade from the S6 that I had before this.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been a Blackberry person for over 20 years. One of my first cell phones was a Blackberry. My husband checked me for a temperature when I ordered this Samsung Galaxy S7. So, I LOVE IT!!!! I have had very little trouble getting use to the the new icons. The phone works so similar to my Samsung Tablet that I really did not have any trouble converting. Phone was in excellent, like new shape and ported right over to my Verizon plan. I had to do a couple hours of download on OS updates about a week after I began using it, but went to Verizon store and used their data, saving mine for my stuff.  The size is excellent for me to carry. The features are clear and easy to use. The price was GREAT!! Delivery was as stated. Totally satisfied!
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Caveat: I got this as an upgrade from my first phone, which was old and not the best quality to start with. So I might be a little off perspective about some things.That said, I love this thing. Migrating my information and accounts was really easy, as was dropping the stuff I didn't want. The keyboard is much more precise than my old one. It is much easier to read the screen than my old one, especially for extended periods (I like ebooks). The screen adjusts to ambient light conditions, which is a great. The screens are pretty self-explanatory, and the icons are easy to see. I am still working out some of the differences with services between this and my old one (which wasn't a Samsung), and I don't like any of the default ringtones, but overall I love it!
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"It looked like a good deal until I tried to get it to connect to Verizon,  come to find out is wasn't a Verizon phone,  had to send it back (I paid shipping),  bought a brand new one on eBay cheaper, no tax,  that one was defective, had to finally send it back,  I am using my old S5, bought a new case, makes me think it is new,  oh well i had a black cloud flying over me that week.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered two of these certified refurbished  phones. One was great: in really good shape and worked perfectly, the othe one same shape but the microphone  didn't  work. We have sent it back for a replacement. It has not arrived yet so we don't  know  if  there are any problems with it.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works as spec.  Battery life is as new. Updated immediately to Android 7.0 when first started.  I just plugged in my sim card from my old Galaxy  S7 Edge (I prefer the S7 by the way) - et voila!
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone. Works on AT&T. Quality refurbish.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Needed a charging port replaced. Intermittent wired charging. Too bad..... nice phone otherwise.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great upgrade from my Galaxy S5 - it is SO MUCH faster even with little things like connecting to my bluetooth headset. I was a little hesitant to purchase the Verizon model (G930V) since I am an AT&T customer. I was told in the AT&T store when I had to activate the new sim card that since it's a CDMA device that it would be stuck on the ""H"" (Hospitality) speed network which would not be LTE but would be on 3G speeds. The mobile network will sometimes switch over to H or 3G, but it does stay on 4GLTE most of the time - I'm just using the normal AT&T APN settings. I just tested and got 43Mbps down and 9Mbps up on the mobile network - this is definitely not 3G speed. :) I still need to work through a voicemail issue, though.Also, the device came to me in what appears to be like new condition. There was a small scuff on the top of the phone, but the screen seems pretty much flawless.
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Piece of crap, battery life is terrible. the whole curved edge screen (not even the S7 Edge) makes the phone buggy. As soon as I can I'll be switching to another brand or the iPhone.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"The phone wasn't unlocked and after taking it to 3 different stores none of them could get it working.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a new galaxy s7 from Verizon only to have it not charge after 6 months.  Will be last Samsung I buy.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my S7. I cracked the screen on my old one and I was told I could trade it in for an S8 but instead I purchased another S7. I will be sad when I actually have to give up my S7 for something else.The shipping was quick and the packaging was fine.I will say that the battery life on my phone was so short that I was charging it 4 times a day. I purchased a replacement battery and replaced it myself. It was a little tricky but worth it because I love this phone.The camera on this phone is great. I take tons of photos! I have yet to run out of room. I also use my phone to record videos and it's fine!
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm giving 5 stars. The product is exactly what it was described to be. It works awesome. I've had no issues this far with one exception. Phone kept prompting to have software update. I tried to update from phone several times with no success so instead I used my pc which as long as it works then that's all that matters. The phone came in 2 days early which was awesome! I have purchased several phones online and this is by far one of the better ones.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was a little concerned about buying a refurbished cell phone but decided to take a chance. It looked new out of the box and has been working like new as well. There seems to be a wide range of reviews on these phones. I think it depends on who you buy them from. The issue I have when reading reviews is that is the one thing nobody mentions in most cases. Mine was purchased from BuySPRY. It has been an excellent phone so far and I am glad I went with a refurbished phone now.
            "
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Went to Verizon for some troubleshooting and was told this device belong to another account. Even after taking the box I got it with, was told they couldn't help me. Had to buy another phone.
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased this because the description states: ""Samsung Galaxy S7 G930v 32GB Verizon Wireless"". Verizon could NOT activate this phone because it is not a Verizon phone. Phone came in a box with only the charger and phone. Outside on the box it states ""Samsung galaxy s7 g930 32g Verizon/unlocked black"".  Returning for a full refund.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Could see only one tiny scratch. Otherwise, the phone looks brand new. Battery life is so-so, but that might just be from adding apps and playing with the phone. In typical Samsung fashion, the screen is very sensitive to touch. Annoying, but not a big deal. I added a screen protector that seemed to help.  I've only had the phone for a couple of weeks, but hopefully I'll continue to be happy with my purchase.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"received 3 different phones before the one I have right now, they have great, easy, and fast customer service, everything went fine with a few replacements. convinced the phone doesn't have a oem battery, it discharges very quick.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The phone works very well. I love the camera and the photo editing features. The blue light reduction feature is great as well. The touch screen can be slow and sometimes the words that came up while typing can be very off, but overall I really like my new phone.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the S7 refurbished to replace an older cell phone of mine. Prior to this purchase, I had only purchased new cell phones directly from Verizon, so I was nervous. Well, the phone worked so well and was so easy to set up that I came back and purchased a second one for another family member. The first one shipped from BuySRRY and the second one from Kiss Electronics, but it did not make a difference as both were identical, quality products.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My son's Galaxy S7 screen went dead the last time he dropped it. We bought the same phone from this company and we stuck in his SIM card and SD card and its worked like a dream. Its a certified refurbished but looks and acts like brand new. It was fast shipping too! Thanks!!
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I received mine from DealFisher a few months ago. The battery seems to hold up well and everything has been in good working order. The home button is likely aftermarket and a little ""clickier"" than it would be from a new phone, and the fingerprint scanner isn't quite as consistent with it  as I'd expect (less so than it was with my S6). Overall it was very much worth it to buy refurbished.
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"After reading the negative reviews mixed with some positive ones, I figured it would be a gamble purchasing this refurbished phone. Well, I lost that wager. Phone went from 100% battery to 34% in 2 hours, with very limited use. Tried removing unnecessary apps, dimming the screen, and turning off the ""always on"" screen setting, but nothing helped. Ended up just purchasing a new phone from Verizon.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Galaxy S7 is STILL an amazing phone - even two years after it's initial release. I bought this phone solely for the purpose of capturing 1080p and 4K video with the Osmo Mobile 2 that allows me to walk while recording and get extremely stable footage.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price this phone is awesome. Replaced my S5 that had become a complete mess. This phone is fast, long battery life and no visible wear. Also came with a real fast charger and an adapter so I could easily connect phones and transfer all my info over. Love it so far!
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's holding up okay so far. Brought it to a Verizon shop and got it set up easily. Two complaints about the S7: the charge port still sucks (cords don't fit/ break and probs with moisture getting in) and no memory card.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works as good as the original we bought through the VZW retailer so far (4 months). Had to call verizon and have them re-add visual voicemail because the phone didn't automatically sync when we had it synced with the old phone number (from the phone it replaced.)
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received this phone as an upgrade to my old Samsung S5.  I am so pleased with the build and quality of this phone - it has all the features I need plus more that I don't.  ;)  I mainly use it for texting and checking my social media.  Camera has some great features and pictures are great.  I'm super happy I have this new phone!  For being a re-conditioned phone there was not a mark on it - it looks brand new.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So fare so good!  I'll report back after a year if I have any problems.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Fully charged the phone prior to use. Less than 4 hours later phone was down to 15%. Eighth continued use seems to be losing 20% every hour on the optimized battery setting.The phone took 4 updates in order to work properly.  I'm not sure if that is common but I've not experienced it with other refurbished phones.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I could not be happier with this product.  It was the perfect replacement for a phone that I really liked but accidently destroyed.  It was delivered quickly and I had no problem quickly and easily transferring from my old phone to this one. It is continues to consistently perform very well.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Received a G930U instead of the G930v advertised.  Was able to make it work, but not what I wanted.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is one of the best Samsung phones to date. I have had multiple galaxy phones over the years and this was a jump from the S5 to the S7. Multiple screen ability, great battery life, wireless charging and ease of use make it my favorite phone so far.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered from Electronic deals. The first one received, wouldn't connect when I put in the SIM card. Contacted the seller, and they were great. Sent back the cell with the overnight postage covered by them.  Recieved another soon after.  Works great! Love it. Battery isn't as good as I hoped,  but better than my old one and charges fast with the fast charger I have. Just bought wireless charger and can't wait to recieved it! Highly recommend the seller electronic deals!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it.  Had an S5 but was having battery and display issues.  This was a nice upgrade.  I don't need all the bells and whistles of the latest models and the price for this was certainly right.  I have bought refurbished phones before with no issues and there certainly have been none with this one.  The SIM card is a different size so I couldn't just swap in the one from my S5, but I got one for free from Verizon (took some convincing, however, Verizon store personnel didn't seem to know that they were allowed to give me one without the phone in hand).

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Shipping took 8 days, not sure if that is normal but definitely a first world problem.  I have used this for two days and so far a 5 star. The first day it had to do updates 7 times before I could use it much. Not sure what version it started with but is now up to 7.0. When I took it into Verizon to get a SIM card they said the serial number says this phone is gold, which it is not, it is black. And when I registered the device with Samsung it also shows a gold phone.Finger print reader is very quick and effective. Samsung pay is great and quick to checkout with.Phone is fast and battery life seems good. I'll update the review in a few days and weeks and let you all know how it is holding up.-------I have now used the S7 for almost 2 months.  The only item I will complain about is the speaker phone when on a phone call.  I can hear the other party great, but they have very bad feed back and tell me to turn off speaker phone.  I attempted some troubleshooting myself and then ended up calling Samsung.  An hour on the phone with them and doing all sorts of weird phone restarts, cache clearing and safe mode tests, there is still no answer as to why the speaker phone does not work.  Is it a physical issue or software issue?  Not a clue and Samsung wants me to factory reset the phone as the next step but I am not sure I want to do that yet.The camera is great.  Phone is quick with all applications and the battery lasts all day long.  If you use the always on screen setting to show the time that kills the battery by at least 4 hours quicker so I don't use that anymore.Because of the speakerphone issue I will knock this review down to a 4 star from a 5 star.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Received the phone on time. The charger that came with the phone was slightly bent and also the battery on this phone sucks, it wont even last me during my entire 10 hour work shift which is very unacceptable because my phone is important for my job. Haven't tried contacting the seller because i know they won't help with the battery in a refurbished phone. Once i get paid again i may contact the seller or just go to a phone repair service to have a new battery put in. I will update review then

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very happy with this phone.  Bought it refurbished.  Upgrading from the S4.  32 GB is very nice.  Phone is faster.  Everything worked.  Had to get a new Sim card from my local Verizon dealer, which was easy enough.  Could have cut down the card from the S4, but was easier just to get the new one.  This phone still has headphone jacks, etc., so I am happy with it.  Like this size, like the speed, like the price.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very happy with my purchase.  Was sceptical like everyone when deciding on a refurbished  phone but so glad I did. When I opened the box the phone was flawless and OEM accessories. I am with Straight talk so I also purchased the Verizon nano sim from Amazon since my old S4 was micro then I was ready to go. I am a very satisfied customer.  Thanks

5.0 out of 5 stars,"A phone is just a phone, made for calling and talking.  NOT anymore.  A cell phone is for Talking, Picture Taking, Note taking, my Calendar, My Appointment Book, for Games, News, Entertainment and on and on...OH did I mention you can even make phone calls, TEXT, send pictures and all that good stuff.  A phone like the Samsung Galaxy S7 is a great 21st Century TOOL.  Thanks Samsung.  CC46

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was  very hesitant to purchase a refurbished phone,  but I am presently surprised on how great the condition of the phone is.  It looks brand new,  came with all factory accessories it should,  headphones charges and transfer adapter.  I obviously can't  evaluate the battery but,  I haven't had any issue with the battery and seem to be new if not in great condition.  I would definitely purchase again
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This phone only had one light scratch on the back, activation at Verizon was simple. Battery seems fine, exceeds the duration of my former handset.I'd buy another refurb from this vendor (Prime Mobility)

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had the phone less than 2 weeks when the screen died. I put it in a case and put a screen protector on it within a  hour of it arriving, and never dropped it. But somehow the screen was broken.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"No problems with the phone. It comes with the charger cord and ear buds. It DOES NOT come with the cord to transfer your data from old phone to new (included when purchasing a new phone). It also does not come with the little key to pop open the little compartment for internal cards--you have to use a paperclip.

            "
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, the phone is pretty good. Samsung did a good job. The handset I received is a close facsimile but its obvious that when it was refurbished some lower quality parts/methods were used. The screen is plagued with under-sensitivity. It can be downright frustrating to text or try to play games on it and have to deliberately press harder to get it to respond. The under-sensitivity also causes it to be unusable even with thin gloves. The charge port is also recessed on my particular handset. This hasn't caused any issues with charging yet, but it does make using a gear VR very frustrating. For the cost vs. a new one I can live with these faults, but I'll end up trading it in for a new phone much sooner than I would have if it worked as well as it should.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"just great. the phone was in perfect shape. no scratches or ds all ings.. anything. ive been using it for a couple months now and works perfectly. the only thing is that it comes with a asus charger. it DOES NOT FAST CHARGE and after the first month and some software updates, the phone did not recognize the charger anymore. but. for that price? it does not matter i got the samsung fast charger for 40 at best buy. I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS!

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome phone but the Q&A section is little misleading this phone does not work with Verizon
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"The only two drawbacks are (1) speaker sound quality is noticeably lower than a ""new"" phone, and (2) this is with respect to the model in general -- the glass on S7's is apparently pretty delicate, and after dropping it 3 feet onto concrete (with no case), I've learned that glass cracks/repairs are EXPENSIVE. (Apparently the glue and other tech aspects on the S7 mean that you'll almost certainly have to replace the glass *and* LCD/Digitzer. $200 at our local shop, ouch.)
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"For those who struggled with the horrible battery life of previous galaxy phones, finally this one is tolerable. I highly recommend the upgrade. I finally can feel safe without charging my phone multiple times a day...

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Do not buy this product. Battery exploded.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I hate this thing. Maybe I'm spoiled by the LG, but the functionality of this Samsung sucks.Three things that drive me nuts the most:#1. To unlock the phone from a sleep state first you have to hit the function button. Then you have swipe the screen. Then you have to swipe your pattern. Compare this to the LG, double tap on the screen puts it to sleep, double tap wakes it up, swipe a pattern if you have one. FAST and easy.#2. Battery non-life. My LG I could go for a week. Even when using it heavily it would last 3 days. 5-7 days if I didn't use it much. The Samsung eats the battery in 2 days if not used and 1 day if it's used.  Yes, you can turn on the battery saver, but then most anytime you need to do anything other than answer a call you have to turn it off. Very much a PITA.#3. Alarm. You have to press and hold, the ""button"" (on the screen not the actual button) and then wait, and wait, and wait, and then swipe to turn it off. LD, tap once and it's done.There are more reasons I dislike this phone. Most of it has to do with the fact that I've used LG most of my life and they function better and faster. If you don't know any better you might like the Samsung, but I'm selling it and going back to the an LG. Yes the camera is better in the S7, but the S7 is much heavier then the LG  I previously had. It's also bigger. Not by a lot in terms of inches, but when I put the LG in my shirt pocket I barely knew it was there. The S7 is like a paperweight more than a phone.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had the phone for 6 weeks now with absolutely no issues, it came looking beautiful in a Samsung box with brand new charger and headphones. Super happy with this purchase!!!
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, let me say that I don't like Apple phones. I prefer Android much more than iOS, so all problems I have with this phone have purely to do with the phone itself, not the operating system it runs.Overall, the Samsung Galaxy s7 is great. It's a fast phone, has a great camera, quick fingerprint scanner, super high quality screen, and just looks really, really good. But, on the contrary, there are some things I just don't like about this. So, I've made up a pros and cons list:Pros* High quality screen* Looks good* Great camera* Fast fingerprint scanner* Feels comfortable in my hands* Runs smooth and quick* Expandable storage* Durable* Water proofCons* Glass back* Can become slow over time* Occasionally gets hot* Not the best battery life when compared to other popular phonesMy main problem with the Galaxy S7 is the glass back. I absolutely hate it. In fact, it's the reason I don't give this phone 5 stars. Let me explain why.First, the fingerprints. I absolutely hate it when my phone gets fingerprints all over it, as I'm sure many of you do too. An aluminum backing, like the iPhone and Google Pixel use, is much better. Not only does it not get those finger prints, but it also doesn't crack.I've had the glass backing on mine crack twice now. The first time  I tossed my phone and the back hit a hard piece of plastic and cracked. I got it replaced with OEM glass within a week of that happening.One day, I was in class lighting leaning against a desk talking with my friends with my phone in my pocket. All of the sudden I heard a cracking noise only to pull out my phone and find the back cracked. Again.So, with that said, know this phone is super good and I absolutely love it, but my issues with the glass back has been enough to make me want to switch away from Samsung. I'm likely going to get a Google Pixel next.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Had an S5 and an S7, and I have not gone back to a Galaxy since breaking my S7 and do not plan on ever going back.The S7 was great in the beginning,but after about half a year or maybe less my Galaxy S7 became very buggy (not uncommonly to the point where the phone would have to be restarted), a battery drainer (I am not a heavy phone user, and I keep my screen at 50% brightness at most times), and just frequently frustrating in general.Also the camera is atrocious. It quickly developed a bug where I could not focus on objects within a foot of the lens FOR THE LIFE OF ME.Bottom line, I would NOT recommend this phone to anyone! There are MUCH MUCH MUCH better phones in this price bracket from companies like Motorola, Huawei, Xiaomi, and Essential to name a few.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"This refurb was not the quality I expected.1. The screen had obviously never had a screen protector and was scuffed and micropitted.2. It took a long time for the battery to fully charge - 2-1/2 hours from 61%.3. When I turned it on, it was in Chinese!Immediately returned.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had several Samsung Galaxy phones. The gorilla glass is nice. However, I dropped it once, with a protective case on it and it cracked all the way down the back. It appears that the back glass is not as strong as the front. I'm done with Samsung phones. I'm going to have to carry a cracked phone for at least a couple of years.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not my favorite phone. Texting is terrible. I've typed things over and over and they are still wrong. You can be watching a video and sit the phone down and it disappears. I do not recommend.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this after my s8 was stolen. Sure it's waterproof is a ""smartphone"" but that's where I draw the line. Somehow because it's been refurbished this just doesn't want to work properly. My snapchat app in particular just refuses to work- one app, whatever. But what's worse is that the LED had a strange tint across the entire screen almost like a blue light filter (not enabled) and seemed to have an icon fade from the previous owner's layout. It also doesn't work with other settings like trying to change the ringtone- it refuses to use anything but the system default. It's been 6 months so I've given up on that by now. The charger that the phone came with? A joke. Broke in 2 months. The home button seemed to ""scratch off"" so it looks like it's been chipped away. I have a very good case so unsure how this happened. I tried to contact customer service for a refund/replacement within 30 days but I guess the ONE woman who has to process that wasn't there that day? So after calling the next day a man tells me that he can only process a 10% refund because the LED problem was a ""minor problem"" but I didn't have my order number on me so I had to call back. When I called again, the next person I needed to talk to was not there. So I gave up. It still works, but disappointed in the ""refurbishment"" skills for the price. Would NOT buy again. Buy a new Motorola for the same price.  I should have gone through with the return. Also the battery lasts less than 7 hrs with medium use so good luck bringing it to school/work without a charger. I think new this phone is good but refurbished is not. (Side note: I've been buying Samsungs my whole life).
