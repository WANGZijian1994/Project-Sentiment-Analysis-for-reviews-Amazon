5.0 out of 5 stars,i'm going start review stating basically hated galaxy phones since they've come out loved old samsung flip phone made move android couldn't get them read amazing super amoled screen was thought garbage grainy colors much garish off ui cartoony weird colors years though samsung slowly stripped away bloat refined screens cleaned android skin time finally say they've sold methe feelthe first thing noticed amazing feels crazy thin encased cool smooth curved glass right amount heft make feel premium feels like smooth elegant flat pebble infinity screen and brothers note easily attractive i've ever seen departure older galaxy phones never struck aesthetic note mewhile elongated shape seems odd first actually makes screen narrow flagships works well accessing entire screen one hand still stretch managable way makes new onscreen navigation keys less obtrusive speaking onscreen keys i've never fan now work well home button even vibrating click press in like turning screen unlocking one shotthe physical buttons bit easy accidentally press don't like bixby button which i'll get later unnecessary makes volume keys harder findas much like design needs case don't mean bad thing although people i'm sure be delicate allglass design makes highly vulnerable breaking find reading reviews watching drop tests edge display detects accidental touches occasion volume keys clicky thin smooth makes easy drop case solves problems even didn't work construction which do would put case phone personally went spigen rugged armor samsung galaxy case spigen® rugged armor galaxy case cover resilient shock absorption carbon fiber design galaxy  black cs case highly recommend there's even youtube video guy drops tile floor bounces damage whatsoeversoftwarefor years samsung's touchwiz bloated ugly hated cartoony look garish colors which made worse extreme oversaturation super amoled screen now paring bloat finally become useable back samsung also introduced theme engine phones i'm glad did able change default samsung apps menus black shades love much even replace icons different themes although ended using nova launcher icons bought iti like way samsung set apps clean usable intuitive still full handy features probably least favorite gallery although complaints minor issue pictures clumped giant solid wall pictures makes difficult differentiate file little

4.0 out of 5 stars,i've using days wanted share first impressionspros gives amazing amount screen space almost bezel screen stunningly beautiful size doesn't seem overly large woman relatively small hands size noticeable whether hold use comfortably one hand also amazingly thin light amount battery power life get spent kind time playing downloading new apps still battery life nice time tell soon need battery replacement something that's big issue iphones soon seem bad wireless charging before love it almost never plug wireless charging pads stands wherever needed reverse charging nice option although didn't get free buds yet chance try i've wireless buds always seem start issues fairly quickly high cost single like me ability charge another isn't helpful families may really nice plus also mean careful case get want make sure works feature ones support wireless charging not necessarily going work reverse charging lots great camera options course five cameras back front big reason got camera lot fun play them see cons experience them super slo video also cool play with coming older phone options joy particularly pro mode past i've use camera apps get even close pro mode do android samsung's version particular awesome power users like love tweak everything coming iphone joy able customize much particularly appreciate onehanded features using large like but see cons list again lots security options terms protect phone face fast way unlock easily faked not secure i've issues past well lighting not good new fingerprint scanner supposedly hard fake works lots conditions plenty space gig memory start with microsd nice want load lots music video trip not much everyday use also love still headphone jack ability recharge headphones nice aren't many work yet nothing sucks headphones dying not able plug backup set normal onescons design pretty blah super slippery want get case thing asap sensitivity way edges makes even important trying turn portrait landscape without case seems always cause think i'm clicking something really don't see usable without least minimal case hold with also plastic screen protector comes not going much protecting kind easily rolled sides trying get cases brings con fingerprint scanner touted huge breakthrough seems step back used scanners outside case button iphone first there's nothing help feel put finger haptic feedback anything give help getting finger right place visual pseudobutton screen messages come tell couldn't read print ridiculously tiny hard read press quite hard screen maybe eventually i'll get hang right constantly telling press harder i've never issue normal scanners also makes using glass protectors front far difficult many render unusable much wide tele lens touted samsung quality images get pretty subpar best get semidecent photos outside excellent light compared primary lens particularly indoor shots difference obvious likewise talked night mode would rival quality pixel nowhere close pictures far soft clearly not using kind hdr google using pixel produce good low light shots outside bright light shots tend blown areas still also get frustrated normal photo video modes allow use wide tele lens pro super slo instance not much let camera control what's happening using scene detection vs able set type scene myself granted still big improvement pro mode all there's still want able do still seem think throwing hardware suffice without addressing software side topquality photos pixel one lens still going win many situations likewise additional frontfacing lens selfies i'd much rather wideangle view pixel offers vs using space front camera help blur background even bother ask users want luckily folks moment support even new phones great professional addon lens i'll upgrading kit new superwide angle tele lens certainly performance main lens adjustable aperture quite excellent i'm glad least additional lenses built camera use don't feel like carrying extra lenses me usually don't daily routine google could deliver isn't subpar battery life pixels been would probably pull even customers like over much care photos looking awesome i've share carry battery chargers around day deal phones die quickly much gives good onehanded options hardware design seems completely ignore it buttons freaking high phone i've used don't recall bad power button which doubles camera button double press particularly frustratingly high volume toggle well virtually impossible reach without using hand there's still things androidsamsung find baffling frustrating times get lost trying find way back something sent somewhere else number times i've ended animoji section camera app couldn't figure get back regular camera far often relies dragging screen gestures simple menu option switch screens would much user friendly likewise confusing bluetooth setup shows mac ids devices can't connect to almost comical screen looks like large gym days not show ones can connect to definitely not always easy use really featureheavy device like not sure i'd recommend less experienced users likewise stuff google wants control samsung loads phone feel like i'm turning entire lives companies privacy wise quickly switched using duckduckgo web searches use privacy features concerning much access big companies want phone samsung provide vpn service use well help keep activity secure trust not using track me given companies like facebook done people give number enable factor auth i'm not sure trust anymore price we're iphone range phone clear samsung justifying pushing price additional hardware features like improved screen storage inscreen fingerprint scanner extra cameras definitely step up others like scanner subpar cameras not much like reverse charging may time beneficial likely people initiallyoverall still really good phone however happy gig i'd probably recommend getting saving good bit money there's really nothing much improved worth hundreds dollars things bit step backward imo however really want gig worth relatively small additional bump price comparable storage
