4.0 out of 5 stars,"the S8 Plus is very nice.  The screen is great and the phone is fast, responsive and well designed.  a decent wired headset and fast charger is included.  i am getting good battery life.  my only complaint is the apps that come with the phone and can’t be uninstalled.  this is especially true of the bixby app which i don’t use.  it has a dedicated button which i disabled.  the voice dictation doesn’t work as well as the Google dictation.  fortunately it can be changed to use Google by default.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought 2 of these and so far they're working great. I had to give a 4 rating because they took about 3 weeks to reach me. Not sure what happened with the shipping. I also had trouble getting 1 of them to set up. It came up as T-Mobile and refused to recognize my Verizon card. It took me hours to get it to work. I had to factory reset and keep restarting the phone over and over before it recognized it as a Verizon card. As far as the phones go they came factory packaged and appeared to be brand new. No complaints there! Make sure to check with your carrier before buying and see if they use GSM or CDMA. Buy the wrong phone and it will not work!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The S8 is a great phone. I got this for my girlfriend for her birthday and I was worried it would be annoying to get activated on her Verizon account. I was completely wrong: she took her sim card out of her iphone 6, put it in her new S8, let the phone finish its initial setup, and that was literally it. She didn't have to even log into her Verizon account and register anything, it just worked immediately (i.e. she could send texts and calls and use her 4g network when wifi was turned off). Very impressive.Pros:- instant setup without any hassle or contacting Verizon. Didn't need to contact or even login to Verizon (already had a sim card from another Verizon phone)- Fast, great screen, Android, great camera, expandable disk space, slim, gorgeous- Powerful enough to emulate ps1 games- Still has a dedicated headphone jackCons:- dedicated Bixby (virtual assistant that I don't care to learn) button that can only be disabled not reprogrammed- inserting sim and sd card works via a flimsy insert that pops out the top. Fortunately you only likely have to do this once or twice

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I read the good, the bad, the ugly reviews and took my chances. 2-day shipping, little scratches on the box but at least the phone was in there. I activated the new T-Mobile sim card with my existing account and all my data from my old galaxy phone got transferred smoothly. The phone has a great sleek modern look and feel, no problems with it.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Arrived quickly, took to ATT for activation with absolutely no problem. I was in and out in less than 30 minutes including adding changes to my account. Phone is a nice size, display very clear. My only con is that the font sizes are not great and don't allow too much adjustment. With a bigger screen, this is harder to read texts on than my Galaxy 5. I will play with the screen zoom and fonts, may see if I can download one that works better for me. Overall it's very nice, and a definite upgrade. Glad I stayed with Galaxy.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"SO I ordered the Samsung galaxy s8 unlocked 64GB-US model  G950U midnight black US warranty. Used in good conditions retailed for $519.00 plus tax . It shipped Amazon prime and it arrived via Fedex. Presentation and packaging was nice I expected a crappy box but it came in a nicely detailed android smartphone device box.  So when I turned on the phone I was worried because it had a Verizon smart up menu and when we inserted our metro pcs sim card it read "" not a verizon sim card"" anyways so I went to Metro pcs decided to get a new sim card because mines was old anyways and then they asked if the galaxy s8 phone was unlocked I said yes, the guy was kinda rude and said some features are not going to work properly it seems like no carrier wants to activate unlocked phones these days anyways he set it up. I got home and checked my main features I use like, casting to tv, wifi, browser & youtube sharing, messaging, messaging sharing, bluetooth, wireless charging, sharing, phone calls, google chrome, google home everything worked perfectly so maybe its just the feautures offered from the Verizon network.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Where do I even begin? This is advertised as a new 64gb black Samsung galaxy S8. What I received was a 32gb gold Samsung galaxy S7 edge inside of a S8 box. Not to mention the front and back of the phone were both shattered - and the cherry on top? There was a little ""don't open if this seal is broken"" sticker on it. It would be hilarious if it didn't cost me $400. I'll be putting this straight back in the box to return it, but it's tough to fight the urge to toss it in the trash.This is a complete waste of money and this seller is a blatant scammer.  I saw some other negative comments and thought ""surely it will work out anyway, I know what I'm doing."" I suspect the positive comments were posted by bots, shills of some sort or by the seller themself. Please save yourself the time and money and don't fall for this like I did.Pics so you can laugh at my misfortune.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this to use as part of my Verizon account.  Obtained a sim card from the Verizon store and they activated it successfully.  This is an AT&T Phone and comes with an AT&T sim card.  It does work on the Verizon network but the AT&T logo is all over it including the built-in AT&T apps.  The built-in apps can be disabled but not deleted.  The time did not want to sync but that may change with updates.  I gave it 4 stars because they could be more up-front that it is AT&T.  The Galaxy S8 is a great phone.  So far, it is worth the $400 savings over getting it from Verizon.  Only time will tell.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was skeptic about buying this because I wasn't sure it would work with my phone plan (Ihave boost mobile). Plus the phone was used and I was worried about what condition it would actually be in once I've gotten it. Once I received the phone it looked brand new not 1 scratch on it. Boost couldn't activate it though so I became a little discouraged. The girl that worked at boost told me I could go to sprint and they would help me for a fee. I went to sprint to get the sims card that boost does not carry on hand. They would have had to order it. So I went to sprint gave them the info on the sim card I needed. They were able to help me and the sims card ended up being free. Setup was easy after that. I just needed to put my info into the phone and less then 5 minutes it was up and running. I love that the phone came with a warranty. I purchased the phone October 2018 and I called samsung to find out how much longer the warranty was good for. They told me August of next year. I do have two cons about my purchase #1 being it doesn't come with a charger and #2 it doesn't come with the fancy headphones that the s8 comes with. Overall I'm please with my purchase.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got tired of being forcibly throttled by iOS.  I had an iPhone 7 and like my iPad Air 2 both seem to be running slower and slower regardless of actions taken to remedy.I decided to go back to Android.This S8+ COULD redeem Android for me as prior Android phones were slow, laggy, and poor performers that proved unreliable.  This phone is fast, works smooth with minimal issue and most importantly, is reliable. Unfortunately some of the little, insignificant things have not been resolved but functionality is much higher than with my iPhone 7.Of course, it is still early on, if I have any issues, I will update my review as usual.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had a Samsungs since high school. It is just easier to use and I know how they work. I like the slickness, the volume, and the picture quality. I am a simple person and I don't generally find out everything that my new technology does but the Samsung has prompted me to do just about everything it could possibly do. Also, it being unlocked worked out. I thought it was going to be a hassle but I walked right into AT&T and they had my new phone and new service up and running within 30 minutes. Great buy in my opinion. Being a prime member was worth it in the end also because it arrived on Sunday as promised. The only thing the US post office service dropped this VERY expensive device at the door without knocking to let anyone know it was there! As opposed to UPs or FEDEX they don't bother to get you to sign. I would advice using one of the Amazon mailbox stations at the QT gas station or where ever they are closest to your location. Much safer.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a Samsung so I live it. I got this to replace my S7 that was terrible,and battery life as super low.I was thinking about getting the S9 with Sprint,but their prices are insane and the S9 has not much difference from the S8 other the finger print scanner button, new processor and new camera. It is not worth the price and the monthly payment to the carrier. I decided to get a unlocked S8 and not own them a penny what's great. It works with Sprint just fine, I highly recommend you to buy your own phone than deal with these carrier financing scam.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the look and functionality of this phone. It's got plenty of internal storage and a slot for my memory chip. I'm not thrilled with the charging port, all my micro USB chargers are now useless, and the battery life is not amazing. My old phone, a cheap Samsung J3, had a 12 hour battery life. Usually, far longer. Even so, I love this phone and it did come with an attachment to convert one of my micro USB car chargers into a compatible charger, so... Ultimately, a great purchase. I'll just have to charge it on long work days.
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this in September of 2017 and absolutely loved it. Then they pushed an update for Oreo about 6 months ago which caused the phone to no longer allow Bluetooth control of streaming services through my vehicles head unit. I waited for a fix. I looked online, and tried everything from factory resets to changing developer mode settings, updating the firmware on the head unit, contacting Pandora's tech support. Samsung's solution is for me to send it (my only active phone) in, and wait a week or two with no phone so they can send me a refurbished one... with no guarantee that it will fix the issue. Yep, I send them a phone that was purchased new, go without a phone for two weeks, and then they'll send me back a 'refurbished' phone potentially with a scratched up screen and poor battery, that will likely not fix the issue since it is clearly a software problem. I used to swear by Samsung, but I can no longer recommend Samsung to anyone based on my S8 not working properly for 2/3 of the time I've owned it. I currently own the following Samsung devices, Galaxy S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, Gear, Gear S Nano, Samsung Refrigerator, and a Curved 4k TV. I say this so you know how much I have enjoyed Samsung in the past. If they release an update that breaks something, their expectation is that you'll just go buy a new one - I've given them 6 months to fix what they broke in the Oreo update and they haven't done it... they haven't had any trouble though pushing their new phone. No thanks. Now as items stop working I will make sure to avoid Samsung.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"The Samsung Galaxy S8 I was shipped had model number SM-G950F, which is the international version of the phone, not the US version as specified in this item.I recently got lines of dead pixels in my S8 and Samsung refuses to pay for it because the international version of the phone does not have a warranty coverage as promised in this item.

I reboot the phone and notice at start up a Verizon start up screen a peers.  Is the phone locked or unlocked as advertised?

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was skeptical about buying this phone off Amazon instead of Verizon because the reviews were half good, half bad as far as activating it on the Verizon network.  My advice is dont go to the store and activate yourself on their website.  It takes just 5-10 minutes.  Just make sure to have a Verizon nano SIM card, I was able to use the one from my iphone 6.  Transfer your contacts, music etc on their app as well, it's very easy.  Other than that the actual phone is great.  Very sleek looking phone.  This phone is $756 at Verizon and they try to sell their payment plan to you but I would much rather pay the cheaper Amazon price and keep my phone bill lower.  If you're on the fence like I was I hope this review can help you out.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This review is coming from a long time Apple user. After years of drink the koolaid I decided to make a change.Upgrading from the Apple ecosystem isn't easy as it is a big change but this phone is incredible. It may not be a 2018 flagship but it is still great.CAMERA: the 12 megapixel camera is clear and bright. It does not take the best low light pictures but as good if not better than other flagship of 2017. In daylight this camera shines and is excellent.SCREEN: Samsung has a always had the best quality smartphone screens. The infinity display is something to get used to but the super sampled display is no different. The colors are bright and vibrant. When the display is set to 1440p (factory defaults the display to 1080p) is crystal clear and watching videos or photos it will blow your mind if you compare it to comparable smartphones.DESIGN: The infinity display and glad back are a very elegant design, while allowing for great features and one not so great.FEATURES: This phone most of the features of 2018 flagships. Fingerprint scanner, face unlock and iris scanner. The only thing is the placement of the fingerprint scanner is in less than a desirable location. Being right next to the camera lens it is very easy to smudge it when reaching for it, but the face unlock is very reliable and extremely fast so you have options.Due to the glass back the s8 has wireless charging alongside Samsung's fast charging system allows for easy and fast charging anywhere.HARDWARE: The snapdragon 835 with gigs of ram may not be the latest and greatest but for multitasking and everyday tasks are seemless. Gaming is also fast and smooth. It's no razor phone or note 9 but it is more than capable.All in all this is  great smartphone and is defintly worth your consideration if you can't stomach 1000$ for a phone.
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Just after my support ended, my screen seems to have begun having a hardware issue. Horizontal lines have begun appearing, and it looks to be a hardware issue. Pretty disappointed that the Amazon support does not last longer considering I've seen multiple posts online about this being an issue. I haven't had any drops or water issues with the phone, so it looks like the AMOLED screens become defective after a certain time potentially.  Note that if you contact Samsung about this, they will require you to send your phone back, which can be a problem if you do not have another phone to use during that time. Buyer beware!
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am honestly astounded by how beautiful and advance this phone is. Coming from an iPhone 6s, this is truly an upgrade worth getting for the price.Firstly, the screen is absolutely the best you can get on the market on any phone right now. It has a beautiful 5.8"" Quad HD+ Super AMOLED (2960x1440 resolution). This makes the colors, contrast, and blacks more vivid and pure.  The pure black is pixels turned off when they aren't needed. This gives an amazing black color and helps a bit with the battery not needing to display extra pixels. The screen also employs Samsung's ""Infinity Display"". This creates a nearly bezel-less design on the front screen which gives can provide more information on the screen. They have removed their physical buttons, but it's really noticeable after a few minutes. A feature that I have come to use quite a bit (with widgets and fast opening of certain apps) is the Edge. I am very glad they've introduced the Edge screen onto the regular S series. If you don't prefer it, you can also turn it off. Samsung has also added an Always On Display. This shows the date and time along with notifications you receive. This doesn't consume hardly any battery life (with only losing around 1% an hour)Software: Out of the box, it runs Android 7.0 (Nougat). It also does come with Samsung's 'controversial' TouchWiz skin. However, they've greatly improved the experience and fluidity of the software. I have not noticed any lag with using it for some time now. It's responsive and I personally enjoy the look of it. You can always download different launchers to your liking. S8 users should be able to get Andriod 8.0 (Oreo) within early next month.Hardware: this phone sports 64gb (along with MicroSD slot of up to 256gb of expandable storage) and 4gb of RAM. I am really happy with the amount of RAM and space that's offered. With my iPhone, I've always had to load up the pages I was on again due to the low RAM, along with the very disappointing 16gb of Space (12gb in usable). This limited to using my old phone for daily news and chat apps, while hardly being able to play many games. This is definitely not an issue with the S8! I've downloaded many things that I previously couldn't and I still have a beast amount of storage left. It's also IP68 certified dust and water resistant.Charging: I love the Adaptive Fast Charge that Samsung offers for their products. It charges my phone quickly without it getting hot. The battery capacity is 3000mAh and fast for hours. I can go around 4-6 hours of Screen On Time while going around 12 hours in general. I am very happy with this as regular charging seems quite dated to have it on any (premium) phone.Camera: This Camera is truly beautiful and very detailed. I am surprised by how much I am using it. The photos are clear and crisp all with just one snap. Selfies are also detailed and great to look at. 8MP AF for Front and Dual Pixel 12MP AF for the Rear.Security: The S8 employs two different biometrics for unlocking your phone (along with the regular number/line password). The one we've known for some time is the fingerprint scanner (to which they have moved it right next to the camera. This is not a preferable location as I do hit the Camera often) and the new Iris scanner. The Iris scanner has been quite convenient, though you do have to be a bit close (and in light) for it to work.Voice Command: Samsung has added a new 'Bixby' to their phone line that is to be used similarly to Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, and Google's Assistant. There is a dedicated button on the left side of the phone that allows for Bixby to hear your voice for your questions/command. This button will also open Bixby home, which shows some news, events, personal widgets, and Bixby 'levels'. That is right, you can increase the levels gained on Bixby by using it and helping it with feedback. This doesn't lock you behind any level requirements to use it to the full. This only allows customization unlocks. This has been a controversial feature so far (as many find it unnecessary), though I have been fairly enjoying it. I really use it for screenshots. If you don't prefer it, there are apps to redirect the Bixby button to use it for other apps.Overall, the experience is astounding and I wouldn't trade it for anything else really. This is a phone that will feel premium for years to come. If you're holding out, don't wait! It's an experience unlike any other.NOTE: I have covered the broad specs of the S8, however there are also smaller details that you can view on Samsung's homepage if you want all the specs and information.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I read the reviews and I needed a waterproof phone.  I've only had this for a few days so far and still getting used to why it makes noises at different times.  It told me ""it appears you go to bed around 0030, do you want to enter in plans for tomorrow now?""  or something to that effect at 6pm today.  That is a little creepy to me.  These are supposed to be phones, communication devices not creeper tracking you.I truly believe the prices for these ""smartphones"" are between insane and stupid (over $500 for this one and IPHONES run close enough to $1000), but times are a changing and we all ""need"" to stay connected with these little devices.The camera works really well on this phone as it takes nice, sharp photos.  It was a bit of a challenge to transfer my contacts from a non Samsung phone to this one.  Just export your contacts to a micro SD card from your old phone and put in the new S8.  It only took a short time to bring all the info over to the new phone.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"At first I was thinking ""Am I nuts for spending 600 bucks on a phone?"" Well sanity not withstanding, I am happy with my new phone.I use it with my Tracfone account. So it is cheap for me to maintain for the year. It's nice not having a phone that is locked to any specific carrier.And the functionality of the S8 is great. I like the biometric features. The DEX functionality is a bonus. I didn't even know about it at the time I bought it. The built in device maintenance means I don't have to run an app that bombards me with ads just to clean the phones OS.The bad.Samsung Bixby. I don't have a problem with everyone trying to come up with their own digital assistant software. But it should be optional not forced. In order to disable it on the phone, first you have to agree with the license. Not happy about having to agree to let someone in my house in order to be able to tell them to get out.Samsung Pay. No you cannot hold my wallet.Samsung Health. Stop shoving advertising in my face.But other than that, I love the phone.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Was supposed to be unlocked and compatible with cellular/data programs offered by, among other major providers, Verizon.  Well, it wasn't.  Finally took it to a Verizon store and was told that the phone was simply not compatible with Verizon. So Frustrating! It's so obvious the answer is the best course of action is to go to a provider brick and mortar store (in this case Verizon), and buy the phone there.  Whatever the difference in price is, if any, is more than offset by the time and hassle saved. Ugh!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ordered this device while Harvey was ongoing. There was a slight delay, but that was inevitable due to the inclement weather. Arrived within the time frame and Amazon notified me, as and when there were delays.The device was grouped with the Case and Screen Protector that I had ordered, which was very convenient. Packaging was secure which is expected for this device at such a price range.Overall, the phone is brilliant. Sharp display, clear camera images with AF. It runs all apps like a breeze and is well suited for heavy multitasking. The bezel-less display is a joy to look at and reading on it is very comfortable. It also ships with USB (B to C) and (A to C) adapters, which helps during our transition to USB C type plugs.The battery life is amazing, for a phone with such a sharp and bright display, and also considering the hardware. The 3500mAh battery offers enough juice for an entire day of light usage. Heavy use - like watching movies or playing games like Real Racing, etc. drains it faster, but that is expected from demanding apps.The issue of the fingerprint sensor being too close to the camera is real for the first few days; but after using it as your daily driver, you tend to figure out where it is and it doesn't pose much of a bother, unless you deliberately want to smudge your camera lens.I would highly recommend this device to anyone with a moderately high budget. It looks amazing and performs much better than it looks. I would also recommend to get a protector case (the rear side is a fingerprint magnet and you wouldn't want to crack this amazing display) and a screen protector. To all those having second thoughts, I would say: Go for it!

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I did buy this phone NEW and FROM Amazon just FYINow I know the quality of the product has nothing to do with Amazon so this rating is obviously for the product specifically.I even noticed that someone had the same problem with the phone that I did.It completely died after owning it for about 3 months. I did not do anything to the phone other than add a micro SD card (which is allowed with this device) and it worked fine ever since I bought it.However Amazons warranty is not so great. Samsung does offer a 1 year manufacturers warranty on NEW items. The CSR (Customer Support Representative) was helpful and straight forward. You do have to ship the phone to them, but they will email you a paid for shipping label (Print 3 to place on 3 sides of the box). Excluding the shipping time, maintenance and processing will take 9-11 business days. Obviously no one should have to deal with this in the first place, but I just want a helpful review if someone has a bad situation happen to them like I did. Samsung's CSR is 866-371-9501. Follow the menu prompts and you will get the option to speak to a CSR (it can get annoying waiting through all the options but you'll get there)

4.0 out of 5 stars,"The good: I'm really glad that I got this over spending more for a Verizon phone. There's less garbage on it from the carrier (and the few things that it tried to install when I inserted the SIM card were able to be uninstalled). The battery life is pretty crazy. Even without the power saver mode turned on, it lasts all day. Switch on power saver mode and it won't use hardly any power unless the screen is turned on. The curved screen doesn't cause issues with the touch screen while using it one-handed, and is positively gorgeous. People actually ask me what phone I have. The camera is super fast and takes amazing pictures.The bad: Bixby is not what it's cracked up to be in my opinion. Sure it can do some cool stuff, but 90% of the time it's not helpful. Additionally, there's a really quick, perceptible wait for the microphone to turn on when you hold the button down. I also tend to push the button (or it gets pushed as it's going into my pocket) on accident. For some reason when I type the microphone key on the keyboard to do voice dictation, it refuses to use the Google voice recognition engine. It's not really slick so it won't fall out of your hand, but when I put it screen down on my nightstand, there's some coating or something on the screen that will actually let the phone slowly slide around (because the table isn't 100% level).

Had to use google to translate so I could get it set.The phone will only only use 3g and 2G. 4G is not available.Do not purchase this phone if you are expecting a US version. Amazon should prevent fraudulent vendors like this from selling on their site.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Read my review before make your decision!!!!!!!!!I have purchased the S8 from this seller for around 5 months only. I have never dropped the device, never done any physical damage to the device, never done anything to the operating system. Then when I was using the cellphone for fun, suddenly it shows an problem: Device Storage Corrupted.Therefore, considering this device is still under US one-year warranty, as the seller states in the product description, I contacted Samsung service and sent the S8 to repair. However, Samsung repair center told me that the motherboard of this device is replaced, therefore, it is out of warranty... I am not sure if the seller has an explanation on this?If not, I can only suspect that the seller has done something to the device. Then Do not buy anything from the seller! It will not be under the warranty if there is any problem!!! The Samsung would say it is not from official sellers, they won't be responsible for it!!!

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this in September of 2017 and absolutely loved it. Then they pushed an update for Oreo about 6 months ago which caused the phone to no longer allow Bluetooth control of streaming services through my vehicles head unit. I waited for a fix. I looked online, and tried everything from factory resets to changing developer mode settings, updating the firmware on the head unit, contacting Pandora's tech support. Samsung's solution is for me to send it (my only active phone) in, and wait a week or two with no phone so they can send me a refurbished one... with no guarantee that it will fix the issue. Yep, I send them a phone that was purchased new, go without a phone for two weeks, and then they'll send me back a 'refurbished' phone potentially with a scratched up screen and poor battery, that will likely not fix the issue since it is clearly a software problem. I used to swear by Samsung, but I can no longer recommend Samsung to anyone based on my S8 not working properly for 2/3 of the time I've owned it. I currently own the following Samsung devices, Galaxy S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, Gear, Gear S Nano, Samsung Refrigerator, and a Curved 4k TV. I say this so you know how much I have enjoyed Samsung in the past. If they release an update that breaks something, their expectation is that you'll just go buy a new one - I've given them 6 months to fix what they broke in the Oreo update and they haven't done it... they haven't had any trouble though pushing their new phone. No thanks. Now as items stop working I will make sure to avoid Samsung.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"The Samsung Galaxy S8 I was shipped had model number SM-G950F, which is the international version of the phone, not the US version as specified in this item.I recently got lines of dead pixels in my S8 and Samsung refuses to pay for it because the international version of the phone does not have a warranty coverage as promised in this item.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"What I like the most about the phone is that it was a unlocked phone but when I had it activated by T-mobile it work fine for a day unlimited data,talk, and texted. The second day I got a notice in notification screen that it needed a Verizon Sim card ,the phone became useless no talk no text. I reboot the phone and notice at start up a Verizon start up screen a peers.  Is the phone locked or unlocked as advertised?

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was skeptical about buying this phone off Amazon instead of Verizon because the reviews were half good, half bad as far as activating it on the Verizon network.  My advice is dont go to the store and activate yourself on their website.  It takes just 5-10 minutes.  Just make sure to have a Verizon nano SIM card, I was able to use the one from my iphone 6.  Transfer your contacts, music etc on their app as well, it's very easy.  Other than that the actual phone is great.  Very sleek looking phone.  This phone is $756 at Verizon and they try to sell their payment plan to you but I would much rather pay the cheaper Amazon price and keep my phone bill lower.  If you're on the fence like I was I hope this review can help you out.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This review is coming from a long time Apple user. After years of drink the koolaid I decided to make a change.Upgrading from the Apple ecosystem isn't easy as it is a big change but this phone is incredible. It may not be a 2018 flagship but it is still great.CAMERA: the 12 megapixel camera is clear and bright. It does not take the best low light pictures but as good if not better than other flagship of 2017. In daylight this camera shines and is excellent.SCREEN: Samsung has a always had the best quality smartphone screens. The infinity display is something to get used to but the super sampled display is no different. The colors are bright and vibrant. When the display is set to 1440p (factory defaults the display to 1080p) is crystal clear and watching videos or photos it will blow your mind if you compare it to comparable smartphones.DESIGN: The infinity display and glad back are a very elegant design, while allowing for great features and one not so great.FEATURES: This phone most of the features of 2018 flagships. Fingerprint scanner, face unlock and iris scanner. The only thing is the placement of the fingerprint scanner is in less than a desirable location. Being right next to the camera lens it is very easy to smudge it when reaching for it, but the face unlock is very reliable and extremely fast so you have options.Due to the glass back the s8 has wireless charging alongside Samsung's fast charging system allows for easy and fast charging anywhere.HARDWARE: The snapdragon 835 with gigs of ram may not be the latest and greatest but for multitasking and everyday tasks are seemless. Gaming is also fast and smooth. It's no razor phone or note 9 but it is more than capable.All in all this is  great smartphone and is defintly worth your consideration if you can't stomach 1000$ for a phone.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Just after my support ended, my screen seems to have begun having a hardware issue. Horizontal lines have begun appearing, and it looks to be a hardware issue. Pretty disappointed that the Amazon support does not last longer considering I've seen multiple posts online about this being an issue. I haven't had any drops or water issues with the phone, so it looks like the AMOLED screens become defective after a certain time potentially.  Note that if you contact Samsung about this, they will require you to send your phone back, which can be a problem if you do not have another phone to use during that time. Buyer beware!
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am honestly astounded by how beautiful and advance this phone is. Coming from an iPhone 6s, this is truly an upgrade worth getting for the price.Firstly, the screen is absolutely the best you can get on the market on any phone right now. It has a beautiful 5.8"" Quad HD+ Super AMOLED (2960x1440 resolution). This makes the colors, contrast, and blacks more vivid and pure.  The pure black is pixels turned off when they aren't needed. This gives an amazing black color and helps a bit with the battery not needing to display extra pixels. The screen also employs Samsung's ""Infinity Display"". This creates a nearly bezel-less design on the front screen which gives can provide more information on the screen. They have removed their physical buttons, but it's really noticeable after a few minutes. A feature that I have come to use quite a bit (with widgets and fast opening of certain apps) is the Edge. I am very glad they've introduced the Edge screen onto the regular S series. If you don't prefer it, you can also turn it off. Samsung has also added an Always On Display. This shows the date and time along with notifications you receive. This doesn't consume hardly any battery life (with only losing around 1% an hour)Software: Out of the box, it runs Android 7.0 (Nougat). It also does come with Samsung's 'controversial' TouchWiz skin. However, they've greatly improved the experience and fluidity of the software. I have not noticed any lag with using it for some time now. It's responsive and I personally enjoy the look of it. You can always download different launchers to your liking. S8 users should be able to get Andriod 8.0 (Oreo) within early next month.Hardware: this phone sports 64gb (along with MicroSD slot of up to 256gb of expandable storage) and 4gb of RAM. I am really happy with the amount of RAM and space that's offered. With my iPhone, I've always had to load up the pages I was on again due to the low RAM, along with the very disappointing 16gb of Space (12gb in usable). This limited to using my old phone for daily news and chat apps, while hardly being able to play many games. This is definitely not an issue with the S8! I've downloaded many things that I previously couldn't and I still have a beast amount of storage left. It's also IP68 certified dust and water resistant.Charging: I love the Adaptive Fast Charge that Samsung offers for their products. It charges my phone quickly without it getting hot. The battery capacity is 3000mAh and fast for hours. I can go around 4-6 hours of Screen On Time while going around 12 hours in general. I am very happy with this as regular charging seems quite dated to have it on any (premium) phone.Camera: This Camera is truly beautiful and very detailed. I am surprised by how much I am using it. The photos are clear and crisp all with just one snap. Selfies are also detailed and great to look at. 8MP AF for Front and Dual Pixel 12MP AF for the Rear.Security: The S8 employs two different biometrics for unlocking your phone (along with the regular number/line password). The one we've known for some time is the fingerprint scanner (to which they have moved it right next to the camera. This is not a preferable location as I do hit the Camera often) and the new Iris scanner. The Iris scanner has been quite convenient, though you do have to be a bit close (and in light) for it to work.Voice Command: Samsung has added a new 'Bixby' to their phone line that is to be used similarly to Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, and Google's Assistant. There is a dedicated button on the left side of the phone that allows for Bixby to hear your voice for your questions/command. This button will also open Bixby home, which shows some news, events, personal widgets, and Bixby 'levels'. That is right, you can increase the levels gained on Bixby by using it and helping it with feedback. This doesn't lock you behind any level requirements to use it to the full. This only allows customization unlocks. This has been a controversial feature so far (as many find it unnecessary), though I have been fairly enjoying it. I really use it for screenshots. If you don't prefer it, there are apps to redirect the Bixby button to use it for other apps.Overall, the experience is astounding and I wouldn't trade it for anything else really. This is a phone that will feel premium for years to come. If you're holding out, don't wait! It's an experience unlike any other.NOTE: I have covered the broad specs of the S8, however there are also smaller details that you can view on Samsung's homepage if you want all the specs and information.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is for the model SM-G950 and SOLD and FULFILLED by AMAZON.*I bought this phone from Amazon directly, so beware of other negative reviews from other shops*So far I love this phone. When it arrived it was clearly brand new in the box, never been touched. It also came with Samsung headphones inside the box, even though the option I selected was 'phone only'.  It is lightning fast and the camera is incredible!  It was an easy transition from my old Galaxy S5. I am with Tmobile and had to go get a micro-sim activated for this phone. Never had an issue in compatibility with T-Mobile and my overall service coverage actually improved. There is a minimal amount of pre-installed apps which is nice as it won't slow the phone down with unnecessary bloatware.  Completely satisfied with my purchase and will update if anything changes.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"In less than 8 months, the call volume on this phone no longer works.  After numerous hours on the phone and at an authorized service center, it was determined that it is a manufacturers defect.  Customer support from Samsung was not helpful.  I have to send the phone back to Samsung to be repaired; and although the phone is under warranty Samsung support refused to provide a loaner and told me I have to wait 2 weeks for the phone to be repaired.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"After my phone started to show it's age (about 5 years old and the battery needed to be constantly charged up during the day). The hunt for a new phone began. After reading a bunch of reviews and going on the various phone forums, I decided to go with the Samsung S8+. I had an iPhone before and hated it, so, that was not an option.I've had the S8+ for a year now and I couldn't be any happier. The unlocked version was a better buy than getting it from my carrier because Samsung sends out updates immediately, while your carrier is a lot slower in rolling out the latest updates. One of the reasons for not getting it from my carrier is the lack of ""Bloatware"" that carriers like to add to their phones. My unlocked phone still has a very good battery life (I can go three days without charging my phone). Under heavy usage, I can go two days between charges.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wifey's an Apple-Head ... I'm Team Samsung ... the debate continues.  She recently upgraded to the iPhone 7 Plus (Red Special Edition) ... & it's 'nice' ... but when I received my new Galaxy S8+, I was instantaneously reminded of the style, quality & excellence that only Samsung can deliver.  It's not even close.* FYI ... I purchased a Verizon Prepaid SIM Card, as a suggested add-on through Amazon after adding the phone to my Cart.  The Verizon SIM Card is a 'Verizon Wireless SIM Kit Prepaid Sim Card - (Moto G & Any Verizon Branded Phone)'.  When I attempted to activate the phone w/ SIM Card through the Verizon Wireless website, the activation would not complete & Verizon claimed I needed a 'Samsung' SIM Car Kit.  However, my wife completed the activation steps that accompanied the SIM Card Kit (the instructions on the packaging), & the activation completed flawlessly.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This phone was rated as ""good"" from warehouse deals. When it arrived it was in the factory box and looked like it had never been opened.  The plastic was still on the screen. I found no scratches or imperfections. My carrier is Sprint. It is truly unlocked for all carriers.They had me hooked up in about 15 minutes. The clerk asked me if i had bought the phone new from Samsung directly. He told me it was the unlocked version that would work internationally too.I have had the phone a couple of weeks and it has performed flawlessly. This was another great buy for me here on Amazon. If you are on the fence like I was about upgrading to the S8, go ahead and buy one here, its just an awesome phone. I had an S5 that was great but this S8 is so much better. Trust me on this. Go ahead and buy it. You will be amazed too!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ordered this device while Harvey was ongoing. There was a slight delay, but that was inevitable due to the inclement weather. Arrived within the time frame and Amazon notified me, as and when there were delays.The device was grouped with the Case and Screen Protector that I had ordered, which was very convenient. Packaging was secure which is expected for this device at such a price range.Overall, the phone is brilliant. Sharp display, clear camera images with AF. It runs all apps like a breeze and is well suited for heavy multitasking. The bezel-less display is a joy to look at and reading on it is very comfortable. It also ships with USB (B to C) and (A to C) adapters, which helps during our transition to USB C type plugs.The battery life is amazing, for a phone with such a sharp and bright display, and also considering the hardware. The 3500mAh battery offers enough juice for an entire day of light usage. Heavy use - like watching movies or playing games like Real Racing, etc. drains it faster, but that is expected from demanding apps.The issue of the fingerprint sensor being too close to the camera is real for the first few days; but after using it as your daily driver, you tend to figure out where it is and it doesn't pose much of a bother, unless you deliberately want to smudge your camera lens.I would highly recommend this device to anyone with a moderately high budget. It looks amazing and performs much better than it looks. I would also recommend to get a protector case (the rear side is a fingerprint magnet and you wouldn't want to crack this amazing display) and a screen protector. To all those having second thoughts, I would say: Go for it!

4.0 out of 5 stars,"There is a lot I love about this phone but a handful of things I'm not crazy about. Picture quality, sound quality, storage, all of those are great. The Bixby button sucks. The location of the button is TERRIBLE and I'm constantly hitting it on accident and having Bixby take over my screen. I dont use Bixby, I can't figure out how to turn the option off (of that's even possible). Another thing I dont care for is how easy it is to move apps and folders around on the screen. It seems like at least once a week I look at my phone and some apps/folders are in a different place I have no idea when it happened. Lastly, I switched to this phone from an iPhone 5, and it seems like my cell service (which didnt change) is WAY worse. Lots of calls going straight to voicemail without my phone ever ringing. I never had that issue on iPhone. Overall I'm very pleased. The battery life is amazing (kicks the iPhone's booty for sure), memory space is amazing (again, kicking booty). I wouldnt go back

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This phone is dope, it looks cool and it feels cool. Some people dont like where the finger print scanner is located but I dont really mind, I got used to it in a day but thats just me. This is one of the best phones I've had, its really fast and you can customize everything!One thing I would like to point out, wich I havent seen any other reviewer talk about, is that when I put my SIM card inside the S8 it dint activate my LTE service, so this is what I did, grab another phone that has a SIM card from your same carrier and copy that phones VPN setting to your S8, it worked for me.Id recomend buying a case if you are prone to droping phones like am, but I have a friend that has had her S8+ for 5 months without a case and has not droped it once, but i wouldnt take that chance.Edit: I added some pictures of what I did with the VPN, you just have to manually copy the information from another cell phone to your S8, hope this helps.Ps.My friend dropped her phone a few days ago lol, buy a case.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This Samsung device receives 9.5 from me.  I have had an issue with almost every apple iPhone, mostly because of their weak cell receptions.  I was always frustrated with call quality and apps crashing.  Also with the last IPhone 6S I had owned the battery would always drain once down to around 25%.  This S8+ does not have any of those problems and is phenomenal in performance.  There is no slowdown switching from apps, video and call quality are top notch.  Color calibration to app resolution, video games to Microsoft apps, whatever you throw at it, it does without difficulty.  Call quality, audio and cell reception quite excellent.  I have T Mobile service and was worrying that the speed would drop from LTE down to 4G or 3.  Not once does it drop from LTE speeds.  I know many people complain about the 16:9 ratio.  This doesn't bother me.  If you want to use pictures for desktop, just adjust the ratio in Camera app.  Almost every app is now fitted for the screen ratio and when streaming videos, you can double tap the screen to zoom to fit.  This feature makes the video streaming very very enjoyable.  The only complain I have is with the AKG ear phones the phone comes with.  Ear buds do not have a good bass.  I ended up using the Samsung ear buds instead.  Factory Unlocked version is definitely worth the price because there are no Carrier bloatware on it.  Yes!  No more Bloatware.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like this phone, upgraded from a comparatively ancient Note 2 and got it last week. The battery life lasts me a bit under two days using it normally with the ""always on"" screen feature, but there are some fancy-looking power saving modes that reduce some of the phone's functionality for significantly longer battery life. I haven't tested them yet though because it hasn't been necessary. I'm sad to see the S Pen go, it wasn't worth spending another $350 for the Note 8, but I'm impressed by how much smoother the screen looks and feels. The camera is also pretty reasonable. Low-light situations are pretty questionable, but for a phone it seems to do a decent job. The camera fares much better in bright indoor lights and outside.The S8 feels pretty light and a bit slick due to how much glass is used in its construction. It's a nice-looking phone, but after having dropped my old one and living with a cracked screen for two years, I took zero chances and put it in an Otterbox Defender case almost immediately.The software is also quite nice. There's no carrier bloatware on it so you don't have to spend half an hour trying to uninstall and disable apps that you'll never use, but it still comes with most of the basic apps you'll need. Samsung clearly put in a lot of effort on the overall aesthetics of the interface too. Overall no complaints.My carrier is Verizon and it was relatively painless to get the phone set up with them. I just went to one of their locations (not a third-party retailer) and they gave me a SIM card for free. I was alone during this so they texted a code to my parents and I called them via a landline phone at the store so they could read it me, and after punching that into the terminal the Verizon employee took care of the rest. I recommend using Google or Verizon's cloud backup or some other software (like Samsung Kies) to get your contacts BEFORE getting the new phone. I forgot to do that so I walked around for two days getting texts from disembodied numbers until I worked it out on my own. Set up backups NOW, my old phone's screen was completely broken (hence the new phone) and the only reason I was able to get my contacts off of it was because the S Pen digitizer was still functioning (but nothing else) so I could blindly punch in my PIN to unlock the phone.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had this phone for several months now.This phone has great specs and does not fail in that regard. It also contains many of the features expected of flagship phones such as waterproofing and wireless charging.With that said, I had 3 concerns when initially purchasing this phone after coming from a Nexus 6P.1. Phone updates, including upgrades to new versions of Android.2. Non-stock experience, including many Samsung apps already installed.3. Single bottom firing speaker.With that said, the first issue is still a concern. Updates are slow, especially considering that my previous phone is already on the latest version of Android. This is a huge disappointment and will likely prevent me from purchasing another Samsung phone again.The second issue has been less of a concern for me. Many of the Samsung apps add additional functionality that is not found in stock Android. They are very usable and are worth giving a try.The third issue is still and issue, but some people have been able to enable stereo functionality, but will require rooting the phone. The speaker is loud, but stereo audio sounds much better.

A literal life saver, as it ""secret serviced"" a .45 hollow point meant for my femur...I'll elaborate.While I was at the shooting range there was a negligent discharge and the round impacted my left thigh.  Fortunately, I kept my Galaxy S8 in my front left pocket, and it took the round for me.  The bullet went trough the case smashed the back of the phone dented and deformed some metal plate in the phone and then deflected out of the back of the case and came to rest in the bottom of my pants pocket.I'd post pictures but, well, the S8 didn't make it.  I've been using Samsung phones for a few years now with no issues, and now that one has saved my life (probably) I am likely to keep using them.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I was a Apple User for the longest time and i decided to try a Samsung product. I loved the phone, I thought the phone functioned a lot better then any IPhone i had. After about a month of no issues at all, the phone just stopped working. I never dropped the phone or anything, just out of the blue it stopped working. I went and bought 4 different charges (about $100 in chargers) to find out none of the chargers worked to turn the phone on. Luckily, Samsung was very upfront about solving the issue with my phone. Since i bought the phone only a month ago, the phone does have a warranty. I haven't received my new phone yet so still to be determined how they handle the warranty. Assuming they send another one and everything is smooth then ill be a customer again in the future.Overall good phone, just make sure to take care of it assuming it breaks on you. Just to make sure they honor the warranty.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Oh yeah! Few things I have emotional response to when pleased, but this phone, I love him! The wrap around edge beautiful. Hi def screen. Options in depth.I'm getting to like Bixby too. It's helping open controller I can't find, look up things on the web, dial, message, calculate, set timer, define. Still exploring that feature.Fingerprint unlocks quickly. The complaints about location next to camera, I guess I got used to it faster than the average monkey! Since I use the phone in a holder in the car, I added a 3rd print, for when I reach over the phone in the holder, right index finger upside down.Iris recognition, cumbersome.  But when fingers are wet or in gloves, print reader fails. So iris scanner helps.Using for music and internet radio at the gym with belt holder and Bluetooth earphones. Nice custom sound setting for the headset, rich!Way way better than my S5.Like the feature that if stolen and they reset the phone, it will not work without my unlock info! So don't even Try to steal it!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I went from a bootloop ridden LG-g4 to a cheap $50~ phone with a cracked screen/bad mic/speaker for almost 2 years, it didn't really bother me much until I started working and going to college, that's when I started getting lots of calls. So my cheap ass finally decided to get a new phone. After some research, the s8 was the only thing in the 450-500 price range that was was this amazing so I bought it as soon as it was in stock. And I do not regret it for a single moment of the day. This phone has mostly everything I didn't have on my old phone, an amazing screen, water resistant, faster processor, great software, and a good camera. Most of the apps Samsung has are actually useful or at least decent, too bad my cell company forced me to install a bunch of bad apps. The only con I have for this phone is that it doesn't have a ridiculously long battery life compared to my cheap phone, but the tradeoff is the screen/process power of course. Anyways, great phone for the price I guarantee you won't regret it.

It may or may not have been ""unlocked by Samsung"", but that claim is certainly misleading as it leads you to believe that you are receiving a generic universal phone.  Verizon is CDMA, the other more common carriers are GSM and they are not compatible, though some phones offer some of the frequencies of both types.  When I put my AT&T sim card in it, it seemed to work, but the display came up with a Verizon welcome page and there was an annoying ""not a Verizon sim card"" error message in the notification tray.  You could force the error to go away, but it always came back when you powered up the phone.  I did not trust that I would get true GSM performance out of a Verizon phone and might experience slow or degraded performance due to a shortage of available frequencies so I returned the phone and ordered a true unlocked generic phone directly from Samsung.  It cost more but the peace of mind is worth it.  For over $700 including tax you shouldn't have to put up with nuisance messages in your new phone, potentially degraded performance or deceptive advertising.1/11/2018 -  Received my new phone that I ordered from directly from Samsung today.  It is a true generic phone without any carrier software installed and very streamlined.  Now that I have seen what a new phone should look like I can also add to my original review that the phone I received from ""Electronic Deals"" via Amazon was NOT a new phone, or had at least been previously opened because it was missing a few of the accessories were included with the phone I received today and it also had fingerprints all over it. I recommend paying the extra $75 and getting a truly new phone that is universal directly from the Samsung store.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Why didn't anyone tell me about the Samsung galaxy life! I....cuss word....LOVE this phone. Love love love! It is so sleek and beautiful  and smooth. The texting ease. The apps. I hardly know what to do with myself, I am overwhelmed by awesomeness. Listen to me. If you're like me and keep things in your cart for days and weeks at a time because of indeciveness, please believe me....this will be the one thing that is worth the fast click purchase. I'm so sorry I didn't get it sooner but I will never look back. #Samsung fer life!

2.0 out of 5 stars,"It is a nice phone and works well. I have been using it for about 4 months and have not had any problems with how fast the phone operates or any software glitches that are game breaking. However, I do not use the bixby button and it is annoying since my old phone's unlock button is now where that button is located. Also, when utilizing the phone and accidentally touching the curved edges you get little popups in the corners that are also really annoying. And lastly the curved edges make it extremely hard to protect the phone's screen. This is due to not having a phone case that protects those edges of the phone. I much prefer a flat screen. I did not think this would be a huge deal breaker when I purchased the phone but after dropping it twice, with a case on it, I have received two cracks in the screen. One crack for each drop. I will probably end up replacing the screen and trying to make due with the issue, but I am not happy with samsung over this phone and looking a bit harder in the future at other phone manufacturers.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this phone supposedly new from Amazon. When it arrived, everything worked okay except for two major issues:The phone refused to perform software updates over mobile data, despite having proper settingsThe phone microphone does not work at all. Phone calls and other tasks which require the microphone render the unit useless unless a headset is connected. Amazon support was unhelpful, and Samsung support is also useless. This is the second phone I have purchased from them. The first was sent back because the screen stopped responding to touch input. I would not buy a another ""new"" phone from them.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"OK, I'm a mediocre tech, so this phone will do a million things I'll never ask of it, I'm sure. I'll leave the reviews of the actual S8 to those who can do it justice. I will keep my comments to the method of purchase, since if you're like me, you worry that the price here is so much less than at ATT. So, let me just say that the phone arrived in what appeared to be pristinely new packaging. Because my previous phone was an S5 I had to go to ATT for a new SIM card (nano vs micro). Anyway, they didn't charge me for the SIM. I haven't gotten a bill, so I don't know whether I'll have an activation charge, but that would be the case no matter where you purchase. After charging up the phone I started all the opening, transferring, updating. That took an hour or so I think. After that I could text and connect with ease. But, incoming phone calls were so horrible I was just sure I'd screwed up. Online research led me to rebooting the phone and that immediately cleared everything up. All of the startup had apparently set something off. So, I'm VERY pleased with my purchase. I saved over $250 by buying it through the Amazon link as opposed to the ATT plan!!!.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I know I shouldn't be surprised how much nicer the Galaxy S8 is than my S4, but good golly!  It's not difficult to make the transition; the way it works is very similar.  But it's got like an intuitive little brain inside it that knows exactly what I want to do next!  I love it.  And they say old dogs can't learn new tricks.  I feel so technologically capable and advanced!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay. There are lots of negative reviews about this phone but honestly I absolutely LOVE this phone. I used to have an s5 until it got old. I switched to LG for 6 months and I missed my galaxy phone. So I decided to splurge and get myself an s8! That being said... this phone NEEDS A GOOD CASE. I work around concrete floors so I made certain to buy a solid, shock resistant case with protection around the edges. I also got a glass screen protector just out of paranoia. The phone works incredibly well and performs my level of work I need it to do with no problems. :)

3.0 out of 5 stars,"It is as satisfactory as my Droid but the screen broke very easily, light impact.  Two weeks old.  So bummed as it was my first phone which I purchased outright.  Get your screen covers immediately or a case with a cover.Bixby button is where you hold the phone.  If you don't use Bixby you spend frequent and frustrating moments accidentally turning it on and the of course off.  Nuisance.  Good photo quality.If you use Page Plus, there is no Wifi Calling option provided for on their SIM card making good connection unreliable.  Odd as it is the same Verizon network but what do I know?
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The phone was delivered ahead of schedule which is always a plus and was exactly as advertised. Had no problem smart switching info from previous S4 and carrier activation (Sprint to AT&T) was seamless. BTW, Something not advertised, I did find that the S8 will not allow custom sounds to be tagged to individual contacts when messaging. Ring tones sure, but no messaging notifications. So now no matter who messages you, they all sound the same something to keep in mind if that's important to you. I'm told there are work arounds and Apps you can download, but..........Will modify review later if anything changes.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered this on Black Friday and after waiting a few weeks it arrived. I didn't expect to actually enjoy an Android based phone, but I was pleasantly surprised. My carrier fully supports this phone and I consistently get maximum speeds in my city (150/20). At home I get gigabit wifi. It was a little weird to look at the curved sides, but I got used to it after about 2 days. I highly recommend the OtterBox Defender case because this phone, like many others, is a bit too thin for large hands.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this phone when it was on sale for $625. Great deal, based on other prices. I purchased this after my Galaxy S5 died. Coming from the S5, this is a major upgrade. The phone is beautiful, but due to my tendency to drop phones, I have it in a case. I expected to be annoyed by Bixby (based on other reviews), but I actually like ""her"" so far. She's not Siri, but I think she is better than Google's personal assistant. I like that you can unlock the phone by telling Bixby a voice password and because she learns your voice, she won't respond to another voice. My husband tried to talk to her and she ignored him.Besides Bixby, there are a number of upgrades from the S5. Rather than several pages with apps (you can still do that), there is an edge ""tray"" that you can use to easily access your favorite apps. I strongly recommend watching a youtube video to get to know the phone because it can do a lot. Without it, I wouldn't have known about the edge tray, because it is well hidden. I've only had the phone for less than 24 hours, but I will update the review if my opinion changes.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just got my phone yesterday, it arrived in two days.  I thing it should have been backed a little as only was shipped from an Amazon warehouse.  The phone came in a box with very little padding.  I have to say I love my new phone, at it was new not refurbished.  I also had no problems registering it on the Samsung website.  I was a little skeptical in purchasing this at first, there are many negative reviews when it comes to buying a cell phone.  I am glad i bought and I am sure you will too.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you want a gorgeous device with a great camera and amazing specs look no further. When I got the S8 I was a little worried about it being used. To my surprise it was absolutely perfect. I had a couple concerns and after emailing the seller and they went above and beyond to help. I'm completely satisfied with my purchase.
            "
3.0 out of 5 stars,"The phone came in it's original box. At first glance it looked like everything was in order but upon further inspection the booklet was nowhere to be found. The headphones included weren't the usual Samsung brand ones but AKG ones. I found the sound quality of said ear pieces to be subpar to the Samsung ones, not to mention that one of the covers that held the logo of the brand AKG came loose after 3 days of use. Next on the list are the charger and the USB-C cable, we own another S8 so we compared the USB-C ends of both. The cable that came with the new device had a slightly longer end that didn't fit either device properly, not to mention that the inside was a different colour and looked sligthIy damaged. No matter what cable was being used or what device was being charged the charger would emit a loud and annoying buzzing until whatever was being charged had full batteries.The phone is performing well although it's important to note that upon first startup the phone didn't go through it's first setup process but instead went straight to the home screen. All other accessories were present in the box. tried contacting the seller regarding the issues I found to no avail. The phone is excellent, however I would not recommend the seller.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me begin by saying that due to the poor reviews and questions regarding whether the phone has a manufacturer warranty or comments that the phone was not new, received without included accessories, or stopped working shortly after being purchased, I went direct to Samsung to purchase an S8 as my S6 suddenly stopped working.I had no problem paying a slight premium to know that I'd be getting a warranty and a new phone, however after placing my order on Samsung.com, I was informed the S8 was backordered for two weeks. Since I was without a phone and AT&T wanted over $900 to purchase up front, I didn't have much of a choice and decided to try purchasing this one from Amazon.I placed my order on Friday, purchased the supplemental warranty from SquareTrade, and my phone was delivered just as I got home that evening. Even with the SquareTrade warranty, the total price was still less than what Samsung wanted just for the S8.The phone was in the original Samsung packaging and contained all of the standard accessories including the wall charger, cord, adapters for a USB to Micro USB and Micro USB to USB-C, headphones, pamphlets, and the protective plastic on the phone. It was clearly brand new.I logged into my Samsung account after setting the phone up and entered the IMEI number. The phone came right up and stated a valid Samsung warranty. I confirmed this with Samsung customer service as well. The warranty is for 12 months and covers everything aside from water and physical damage, so the SquareTrade warranty should cover the physical damage portion.As for the phone itself the picture and sound quality is fantastic, the camera is great, and it is overall super user friendly. Battery life is OK as it will run a full day with heavy use, but my S6 was nearly dead by early afternoon so I can’t complain.Overall I’m very happy with this purchase. Received the phone hours after ordering and it was in perfect condition with everything I expected. I have AT&T and I just inserted my SIM card and was good to go. I understand the negative reviewers may have had bad experiences so I cannot comment on the consistency of the phones but mine was great all around.
            "
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Learning experienceI’ve been out of the phone market for a long time. Our Samsung S3 & S4 were excellent for many years. They started crashing, so it was time to buy new. I did not want to spend a grand on new phones, so started with Motorola G6 from Costco, on sale for $189. Before I get into the details, while speaking with my carrier tech support, I was directed to Amazon and the S8 on sale for $449.00. That is a grand for two phones. I sat down with the Motorola and Samsung side by side.My old phones had visual voice mail (no data required) and I could send photos via text through wi-fi to save on data. Neither the Motorola or Samsung will do that, and after speaking with a bunch of folks apparently no new phones will do that without third party apps. Data must be turned on to use visual voice mail or send photos. What a rip-off. You would thing since the consumer spends a significant amount of money on Samsung products or whatever brand you prefer, they would be vastly superior to the old phones-not so. Buy a carrier-based phone and they have an app for visual voice mail, but not so for unlocked phones. Using the phones side by side for a few days, I did not see the value of over double the price of the Samsung vs. the G6, so the new S8’s go back to Amazon. I’ve always been a Samsung fan, but am disappointed that the industry has gone this route. Wish my old S4 still worked, I’d keep it.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Relative to what I would have paid if I'd gone full price, I'm happy with the phone overall.I did a side by side comparison of the used device and the brand new device I ordered on my own and with enmployees at the ATT store and none of us could find any imperfections so A+ in that regard.However, after less than two months the speaker is terrible. It sounds like I'm playing whatever I'm listening to (mostly music and podcasts) from the inside of a box. I thought the muffled noise issue might have something to do with water exposure after being near the shower (I know, I know, water resistant does not mean waterproof), so I took some precautionary measures as soon as I noticed the distortion, turned it off, and tossed it in a bag with silica gel overnight. For a phone that's advertised as being resistant to spills, it's kind of a joke that sitting on a shelf outside a shower could spell disaster for its audio output.Additionally, the phone is a lot less durable than one would expect. I still expected the glass screen to be more resistant to scratches.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to write a review about the product because other reviews helped me when deciding on whether or not to get this phone. AllI can say is get this phone. The phone itself is beautiful. It's sleek and fits nicely in your hand. The processor is fast, it's very responsive, and all around a great phone for this price. I've always been an Android user and this phone doesn't disappoint. Most of these reviews are about Bixby and how annoying she is, how the battery isn't as good as other Samsung phones, and the list can go on and on. Regardless of those things, I think it's still an all around great phone, because nothing is perfect. For this price, I would recommend getting this phone! Just remember to keep it protected no matter what! Hope this review helped other skeptical buyers! :)

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I had this phone for about 2 weeks, but I ended up returning it. The camera was really great and took quality photos. I also like the overall design and feel the phone felt very premium. But ultimately I didn't enjoy the Samsung skin over Android, and the software felt jittery compared to my previous phone which was the OnePlus 3. Additionally the placement of the fingerprint sensor was very annoying to me as a left handed person who holds their phone and their left hand of majority of the time. It was just too hard to reach and inconvenient to use.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Samsung Galaxy S8+ is very powerful, very large screen with excellent picture quality.  From a usability standpoint, there simply isn't many better phones out there.  But the curved screen, while unique, leaves a bit to be desired.  When gripping the phone, it's easy to touch things on the sides.  And when apps are not optimized for the curve, some ""buttons"" may be on the curve and difficult to click on (good example is a X for closing an ad.  Might be right on the curve of the glass).  Also, it's difficult to find a good case and that case may not be able to fully protect the phone.  This is because the case cannot fully cover the sides of the phone due to the curved glass.My next phone will not have curved glass.
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The title of this phone states that it is an unlocked phone by Samsung and works on all networks and is a ""U.S."" version.  These are all lies.  The IMEI number was BLACKLISTED and even after calling Samsung they informed us it was NOT a ""U.S."" version but rather an international version which would not work....a complete waste of time and ruined what was going to be a Christmas present for a family member.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great, great phone.  If I could change one thing it would be the glass backing.  I removed my case because it degrades the quality of photos greatly.  I walked into a cement pylon while walking around sightseeing and it ended up cracking the back glass just below all the important stuff.  Thankfully it all still works but I wasn't running, just walking, and the compression between my leg and the pylon was enough.  About the only issue I have had with it that is Samsung's ""fault"".

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hardware is top notch. The phone is impressively powerful and the beautiful screen makes using it a joy. Music fans will love the SD card support and 3.5mm jack. (Yes, it's still able to store your old massive collection of MP3s AND you can enjoy it with your expensive wired headphones!)Battery lasts the day (unless you're in a cell deadspot) and will get you through the night if you do a rapid top up around noon.The unit is mostly waterproof and will survive in the rain or shower (both tested) but it won't be much use under water and probably won't survive anything much deeper than a bathtub.Software might not be to everyone's liking but it's the usual Android system underneath so you can change it however you like.Only real downside is that it's so pleasant to use I don't use my expensive PC much anymore.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the phone on November 2017.1. Two weeks of use and I started noticing a green line appears on the screen. When I searched, found that it is a common issue. I raised a request with Amazon and got the phone replaced.2. I always use a phone cover. Close to one year of usage, I removed the phone cover to clean the phone. Noticed that the phone back cover has cracks. I have never dropped the phone. Not sure how the cracks came. Again when I searched about it, looks like many people have the same issue.3. Now after 1 year and 2 months of use, the phone has completely stopped working. Keeps restarting and displays ""RAM dump by hard reset"". I can't get into boot mode or download mode to reset the phone. When I took to the Samsung customer care, they said it is out of warranty now and cannot be fixed. It seems that is a motherboard issue and they can't fix it.Total waste of 600$..

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Phone works great on Verizon even though the box etc had the AT&T logo all over it.  Strange thing was that I ordered an S8 a couple months ago from the same amazon web link and got a Verizon phone which is what I wanted.  So my wife liked my phone and I simply used the link from my previous amazon order and low and behold I get this AT&T one.  Took this new S8 to the Verizon store and they did their magic and loaded all my wifes contacts/apps/etc from her old phone to this AT&T one and everything works fine.  Strange thing is that both phones were ordered from the same Amazon link but were fulfilled by different suppliers.  The Verizon phone came from JTS Wireless and the AT&T phone came from Levy Commerce.  I should also say that both phones were definitely NEW phones, not rebuilt, even though the Amazon website did not explicitly say NEW.  I did post a question and was answered that I was purchasing a NEW phone.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm typing the review on the phone right now so it would be rather difficult to take a picture of the product, but that being said. I'm very happy with the phone and only have minor complaints about it.The Good:Great and quality displayThe speakers are better than most phones from this particular generationI'm yet to have the phone crash or have any major problemsGreat INITIAL battery life (will come back to this)Camera quality is astounding even on lower settingsThe bad:The bixby button is a satan spawn and never should have been made into an actual button. ""Okay Google"" is far superior in basically every way.The battery life I've found has steadily declined in only a few months. It used to I could go almost a full day and a hald without charging. I purchased the phone I think in June and it's now December 31st, 2018 at the time of my review, and I have to charge 2-3 times a day usually with the same amount of use.Also did I mention the bixby button?Conclusion:All in all a great phone with a great interface and very user friendly as well as good durability with very few complaints about it

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was getting sick and tired of my one day battery life on my old phone.  The Samsung S8+ is rated higher than the S9+ for battery life so I went for it.  It was several hundred dollars less than what Verizon wanted.  I charge it every other day now.  The bad:  Well, not that bad.  My Verizon caller ID no longer worked because this is an unlocked version (kind of generic so to speak) Also my Verizon voicemail (visual voicemail) was not available.  Big deal,I found another.  No issues.  I am using the free app Hiya for caller ID and block.  Awesome.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"The phone itself works fine with great colors and reasonably fast. Take excellent pictures and videos and all in all would buy it again. My biggest negative is that for some reason within two weeks of having this phone it crashed and unfortunately I had just taken about 60 pictures that day which never made it to the cloud and I lost them all. Very disappointing.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a very fast and attractive phone. It is narrow enough to hold comfortably in your hand but still has a large screen. The camera takes sharp pictures and is quickly accessed from your lock screen. I like the edge menu and customized it to give me quicker access to apps I use most. Audio in all forms gets great playback quality. The speakerphone is loud and clear for video or voicemail playback and there is customization in the sound menu to tailor headphone audio to your hearing spectrum. Battery life is good, generally lasting anywhere from a day to a day and a half, and power saving mode is easily enabled if you're low. I effortlessly enrolled it in Samsung Premium Care, but I purchased directly from Amazon, a Samsung authorized retailer. The phone is not perfect. I don't find Bixby useful and am disappointed about the inability to reassign its dedicated button. The phone has a quality feel, but the all glass exterior made me wary to use it unprotected and I wrapped it in a case and screen protector immediately. The curvature on the screen edges also makes it difficult to find and install suitable screen protection. Overall, this phone does everything I want, it’s unlocked so I don't have to root to cut carrier bloat (although there is some Samsung bloatware) and none of my complaints outweigh the things it does well.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I was sold a Galaxy s8+ that was for AT&T and not unlocked. I was on Chat with Verizon tech support for over three hours trying to add my current account to the phone and we found out it isn't unlocked. So, I had to purchase a code in order to unlock it and I won't get the code for two-four days. Very unhappy. Shouldn't advertise that a phone is unlocked if it actually isn't. The phone is compatible with Verizon but it is just the fact I have to go through this after spending about $450. Other than that the phone is nice and does work great.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I will simply add to the ""I love it"" category but I do want to add something that might not be known. Samsung is a bit deceptive in their advertising of this phone. The infinity display is NOT really infinity. Notice they overexpose the edges on the image shown for this product. This is to hide the fact that the display does not really go from edge to edge. It goes over the curve slightly but there is a noticeable edge around the display. It is not technically an Infinity display. That's a bit of a letdown, but not a game changer for me in saying I still love the phone. Mostly because the camera is great and the battery is sick, that is awesome.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had this phone for a couple months now and I thoroughly enjoy all the features especially the camera.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"That was a great price. Took the nano sim straight from our One Plus 2, inserted and booted up and worked 100% (tmobil). Painless switchover! Battery is better than my S6, not twice the life of when the Sy was new, but significantly longer between charges. My S6’s camera is still hard to beat, but for processing, graphics speed and display, and the extensible storage make this a clear winner!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"After reading the reviews, I was a little skeptical about purchasing this  phone, from this seller.  But I had no problem with having Verizon activate this phone. I am on a prepaid plan with Verizon kamma and all they did was walk in to the Verizon store ,and he put the SIM card in, he got on the phone ,asked me a few questions and it was activated.  When I told him what I read online , about some Verizon reps saying the phone wasn't compatible, he agreed that there may have been a ploy to get them to return that phone, and buy it through the Verizon store.  Considering I live in the northeast, and we have had several snowstorms ,  The seller kept me updated as to when my prime Amazon delivery would get to me. It was due to be delivered on a Thursday, but was ultimately delivered on Saturday. Absolutely great experience all the way around

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very happy to find the Samsung S8 unlocked version on an Amazon Warehouse deal. I saved tons of money, and the phone came brand new in the box with plastic protectors still on and everything intact. One CAUTION about buying an unlocked phone is some features that your carrier offers may not work. For instance, I have AT&T, and I don't have Visual Voicemail on this phone. You should research online before you buy an unlocked phone for your particular carrier and see what may not work on the unlocked version. But other than the minor nuisance, I love the freedom of being able to take the phone to whatever Network I may want to use.  In terms of the phone itself, I personally don't like the curved screen aspect at all. But it works very similarly to my Samsung S6 (RIP),  and you pretty much have to keep upgrading (unfortunately) to keep a fast, functional, supported phone.
            "
3.0 out of 5 stars,"First and foremost, the Samsung Galaxy S8 has been one of my favorite Android smartphones of all time. The camera quality, for amateur photographers like myself, is pretty darn good. Furthermore, the processor is super fast and responsive, which compared to the Galaxy S5 that I had, is a huge upgrade. Also, the battery life is amazing. For me, with excessive use of listening to music, scrolling through social media, and other nonsense stuff, the charge lasted from 5-6am to around 10pm or 11pm. Overall, I was very impressed with the phone.Some things that I personally did not like: - the side button that kept triggering the assistant was super annoying. Even after disabling the assistant, hitting the button would still bring up the interface for it - audio quality wasn't the greatest; however, what phone has perfect audio - the screen size was also larger than the standard screen size at the time. So videos and images taken with other devices didn't fit perfectly on the screen, which was slightly annoyingOverall, I was satisfied with my purchase of a certified refurbished phone from Warehouse Deals, Inc UNTIL my phone wouldn't turn on one day while I was studying abroad in Costa Rica. I tried both hard resetting and soft resetting the phone to try to get it turned on, but nothing worked. Eventually, once I returned to the US, I sent the phone into Samsung, mistakenly thinking my phone was still under warranty, and it turns out that whoever declared the product that I received as ""certified refurbished"" was clearly mistaken as there was a huge problem with the circuit board with my phone that was more than likely caused by this ""refurbishing"" process or by the previous customer who had sold the phone to Warehouse Deals, Inc. Furthermore, since Amazon does not supply the IMEI number on the receipt, Samsung could not fulfill the request to fix the phone per the warranty, and I would have had to pay over $600 to repair it. Moral of the story, I recommend buying a warranty, either through Samsung or Amazon, with the purchase of a certified refurbished phone to avoid the hassle that I went through, unless you want to waste $500 on a phone that only lasts 3 months due to a hardware malfunction.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Im not going to get into huge detail here, but I love this phone.The Camera is amazingThe screen is amazingThe fingerprint scanner works better than everyone says it does.I have taken this phone in the shower with me multiple times. 0 problems.it played music underwater (not recommended) with 0 problems.It does take a little getting used to, but the longer I have it, the more I love it.Honestly I can't think of one thing I don't like.except that I wish the bixby button was programmable.And I would recommend the otterbox Defender series case. Ive had it for weeks and it has been incredible.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had a blackberry PRIV with Android that cost me gazzilion and died on me in about a year.As soon as I turned this phone on, immediately noticed incredible difference as to the speed: opening apps, installing, uninstalling, opening and browsing the internet - bam! everything happens just about immediately with this phone, no delays, no ""thinking"" no crashing (so far).One thing that annoys me a bit is really how sophisticated the phone is, like if you put it on a table screen down it will do certain things, face up others, tons of options for how the screen will behave what light what notifications even the movement of the phone itself makes it behave differently, basically I'd have to spend many hours figuring it out that's the only thing but I guess there are bigger problems out there..

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Samsung is on a roll right now when it comes to making flagship devices. The S8 bundles in good looks, an amazing screen and some great software features.I was a bit hesistant buying a samsung phone due to their infamous software lag and heavy skins on top of android. But this UI is much better than previous samsung releases.The only cons are the late software updates and possiblity of the phone slowing down in a couple of months. But for now everything works great.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love it.  It works like a charm.  I just wish they kept the LED notice lights where I could program the different apps and callers with as with the older versions.  You should download the Google keyboard, I kept hitting the period button instead of the space bar with the key board that it came with.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Loving my S8+. Upgraded from Moto G5 Plus. Loving the big edge to edge display. Battery life is amazing. 15% battery on old phone estimated about 1 1/2 hours left. On the S8+, when I got 15% battery reminder I checked in settings and it estimated about 3 1/2 hours worth of battery left. Thought the S8+ might be too big, but now it feels like the perfect size and I'm glad I went for the bigger screen. Fast charging is awesome. Bought myself a wireless charger for the nightstand and I'm loving that feature, as well. Pictures are great. Phone arrived earlier than expected. Great seller. A+

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Phone works great HOWEVER, I realized I cannot do the video calling to another Verizon customer as I did with my Samsung 7 phone.  It's a Verizon feature that these unlocked phones do not have or come with.  I actually loved the fact that you can be on a regular phone call then switch over to a video call.  Will have to use the WhatsApp video call instead.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The best phone ever! !The specs of this phone don't speak out much, but this phone is filled with tons of features, just name the feature. It is thin, perfect looking, brilliant camera. Looks great in our hands. BATTERY My old phone used to consume around 80% of the battery life during the day but this phone has only consumed 35%. Amazing perforce. The new Bixby feature is a great move by Samsung. Google assistant makes the phone even better. The new screen off feature is too good. The edge feature is very usefull at times. Has fingerprint scanner face scanner and iris scanner. The iris scanner, my favorite,  is super fast much better than the iPhone X. The finger print sensor is awkward in position but its super fast too. The screen is mind blowing. Dont hesitate to buy this... Worst every penny

5.0 out of 5 stars,"What a great phone.  So happy that I left Apple.  Everything is great: camera, wireless charging, face or fingerprint sign-in, the built in speakers, the gorgeous screen, the headphone jack (!!!!)... A very smartly made phone, very reliable and quite a tool when you're out in the world - a powerful computer in your pocket.  Even the free earbuds it came with are pretty good.  It's a new world being a non-Apple customer.Once I got a wireless charger for home and a wireless charger for the office, I appreciated this phone even more!

4.0 out of 5 stars,"YES!!! It works on Verizon wireless. I took out the sim chip out of my working s6 and plugged it into the s8 and it just worked!!! Nothing else needed, no activation needed.This is an early review.. Ill append as I fiddle around with the phone.Con:  NO IR blaster (so no controlling infrared devices like a TV or Cable box unless theyre ""smart"" devices on the same network) so you cant use it as a universal remote control like I did with the S5 and S6

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this despite their description stating that it is not compatible with Sprint because people state that it did.

But it is a better business for me to buy an Iphone.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this phone for my wife. We have Verizon as our carrier so we were just a tad nervous if it would work or not. Received the item with no scratches or ding marks. Screen was perfect. Put in her SIM card from her S7 Edge and the phone immediately picked up Verizon. No issues. All of the apps on her old phone transferred perfectly to the new phone. Battery seems to be in great shape. It holds a charge very well. So far no issues what so ever. Keeping fingers crossed that it stays this way. We are Prime members so we knew we would be ok for the first couple of weeks if we had any problems with the product, but so far, all is good! Very happy.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My high school son received this phone just over a year ago, and has had no problems with it and is still using it. So this is the second one we have purchased for our house. My complaint, when this one arrived was the fact that this multiple hundred dollar item was in a box 3 times it size with absolutely no packing at all. It was just free floating from one end of the box to the other when I pick it up. Just the lack of respect for my money to not take the time to humor me with some packing ticked me off

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Gorgeous phone. All glass. Fingerprint sensor location is not so bad as reviews indicate.Disabling app power manager/optimize battery is a must for receiving notifications in timely manner.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This phone has been amazing so far, no issues and the battery last for quite awhile, anywhere from 8 to 12 hours or possibly more based on how often I decide to play games and text on my phone.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"After reading some of the questions and answers I contacted my local Verizon affiliate and told them that I wanted to activate this phone.  I've been a good customer there over the years and they were eager to help me.  Basically we activated a new micro SIM card in a used phone they had using my existing number.  We then transferred the SIM card into this phone and basically the deal was done.  I still had to log into my google account and use the Samsung transfer setup to move info but it all went smooth.  Really enjoying this phone!  What a camera!

If you're thinking about switching to Android, this is the sign for you to take that leap.Fast shipping & perfect condition!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Dope phone. I'm writing this review from it. I've had it for many months now without problems. I'm on AT&T. They activated it right in the store for free, took less than 5 minutes. Picture quality is phenomenal and the phone in general is just gorgeous to look at. I don't use a case or screen protector, just a pop socket, but I also don't drop my phone. I've heard the glass is fragile, so you should consider getting a case.

Lol, honestly, everything about this phone is so good, the camera quality is great, the battery lasts me ALL day and I constantly scroll through apps.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't usually leave reviews but this phone is stunning. I bought the phone through a third party seller that offered the phone with a bundle of high quality accessories. All for $40 dollars less than the listed Amazon price. I couldn't be happier with my purchase.A warning though like many other reviewers this phone is very delicate put a good case and screen protector on this phone it definitely is not meant to be naked. The water proof design is a life savior as my previous phones had died to h2o, it's nice to know this phone is safe against most situations.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, I am very satisfied with the phone. The camera is quite good but it doesn't handle low-light as well as I had hoped. The screen is definitely scratch resistant (you can scratch at the screen with your keys and it won't leave a mark). The glass (front and back) are NOT impact resistant and you can expect them to crack the first time the phone falls from your hands and hits a hard floor (I was aware of this issue beforehand, so no complaints here).

2.0 out of 5 stars,"i purchased my galaxy s8 and everything was great and running perfectly. After about a month or two of me having service under metro pcs (yes i know they arent the best) my phone randomly started saying that i couldnt receive service anymore. after taking it yo metro pcs, i was told they cannot really help me because it was not purchased from. the phone still works fine and this review was written from the actual phone but i cannot have service turned on because of (as it was explained to me) a problem with unlocked phones being kind of a roll of the dice especially when purchasing it online. i didnt want to go through fighting with the company to work a deal with samsung on my warranty because i didnt have time working 14 hours a day and seeing reviews saying that they dont help you anyway.overall the phone is awesome and works fine. that has been my only issue and ive had the phone for nearly a year in 3 months. i guess you get what you paid for, saving a couple hundred but cannot get service. it works on wifi but cant call or text from it but i have to much on here to get rid of it or something.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The phone itself is great, but not the primary reason for this review. Amazon customer service is. Concerns were raised upon delivery when the seal on the box was compromised, but both items were still inside. Upon further inspection, I noticed there was no factory seal on the phone box itself, which essentially voids the ""new"" description of the phone. I immediately called customer service to voice my concerns and have them noted on the order. They understood and promptly began working on a solution. The adequate compensation was nice, but not my priority. Having the notes on the order in the event that I discover problems with the device was. I was told that if something should surface, the problem will be addressed, resolved, or replaced. I found comfort in that. So overall, Amazon customer service was great in this case. The device itself has exceeded my expectations so far, and would recommend it. In fact, I'll be looking into purchasing another for my other half.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am extremely satisfied with this phone. Had no issues activating it with my current Verizon account. Just went to the retailer for a free SIM card and they set everything up. One thing that I wished I had known prior to purchasing this was that with an unlocked phone you will  not have voicemail notifications. This is software that is installed by carriers onto the carrier specific phones. The only way you will know if you have voicemail is to call your mailbox. There are some apps available to download so this really isn't an issue. I just wish I had known about this so I wouldnt have missed some messages.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I am sure I would have liked this phone as I had done plenty of research before purchasing. The phone itself is fine however upon boot it appeared to be defaulted to Spanish. Not a good sign. The phone is touted to be an unlocked US version of the phone, however, this does not appear to be the case for the one I got. After changing the language for the phone and pulling the version number (SM-G950F), I determined this one to be a European version. There is NO CDMA radio capability and Verizon fails to provision this phone on their network. A bit disappointed and returning.

Each and every text message now has the same damn notification sound. The only work around is supposed to be to download an updated version of the Samsung Messages app to set custom notifications per conversation thread. Of course, going into the app to select update shows it has the latest version of the app which doesn't include  this half-baked work around.Suggestions to switch to a 3rd party app that supports per contact notifications is  unacceptable. It's ridiculous to propose an option that will cause me to lose my 10,000+ text message history.

Brought it to Verizon and once we got a SIM card in it everything worked as it should.  I don’t have any Verizon bloatware on the phone (unlocked) which is a bonus.  Huge upgrade from my old HTC Desire 816  in almost every aspect (though I have to admit the HTC had better stereo speakers).  Amazon price was $180 less than Verizon for the same phone.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great cellphone!  It is well made and very easy to work with.  If you can, get the S8 NOTE.  I had one before this and I miss the NOTE.  Nothing beats the NOTE in any category.  I may take a $ loss and go back to/switch to the S8 NOTE.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"There are many issues with this phone.1) battery drains extremely fast , even when not using it2) cant download MMS even after restoring APN and other fixes3) lost calls where phone doesn't ring and caller goes straight to voicemailI have had other Samsung phones in past, but none this bad.Would not recommend.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought 6 months ago, and it's everything I wanted in a phone and more! I avoided setting up Bixby, just cuz I don't use virtual assistants much. The space is so awesome!!! It's also really sturdy - I've dropped it on concrete with nothing more than a thin case to protect it, no issues whatsoever! I hope it lasts a long time!

1.0 out of 5 stars,"My son ordered one of these and had no problems with it. It worked on the Verizon network without a problem so I ordered one for myself. When I tried to activate it the Verizon Network said that it was not compatible with their network. So it depends on which one they send you if it will work or not and unfortunately you will not know until you get the phone.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"3rd month with phone and its progressivly gotten worse. Phone does not come with all features of normal s8 plus such as wifi calling, as well as some camera features. It also drops random calls, as well as won't let people call you randomly. Spend your money elsewhere
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Listen to me right now when I say the S8 is a good phone. Holy crap its amazing super fast HD display this phone is beautiful! Mobile Internation LLC is a trustable place to buy your S8 look at the seller he sells new S8's with no lies or gimmicks. The S8 Got here in one-day I'm playing around with it currently and I'm sure it will gather a lot of attention. If I have any issues ill post them here. This is the type of phone you want to show off people.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"so far so good  the only thing iv noticed that seems to not be the best is the battery life, but honestly upgrading from the phone I got last year to replace a broken one, it's so so so much better. I'm very pleased, I was so scared to buy it off Amazon, over all a great phone
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The phone is amazing but Samsung is still forcing Bixby on it's customers. If you don't know what Bixby is, it's a personal assistant created by Satan himself. It is the most infuriating piece of garbage ever and you have to jump threw a ton of hoops to suppress it in your phone, you can't actually remove it.While the phone itself is amazing i would consider a pixel XL. Hell, after dealing with Bixby i wish i bought one !

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I could not register the galaxy s8+ with Samsung.  I called and gave Samsung support the information on the phone.  It turns out I received the UK version.  It can not be registered in the US.  Temperatures are in Centigrade and I bet some distances are in kilometers.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The phone is amazing and everything I expected. This review is to confirm other reviews and share what I had to go through to get this phone activated through Verizon.I took the phone to Verizon to get a new SIM card (old Note 4 has Micro sim, this phone has Nano sim) and the Verizon employees said it was not Verizon compatible (error messages came up when they scanned the box) and I had to contact customer service to see if the phone could be added to the Verizon database. The customer service employee was very helpful and reassured me that the phone was Verizon compatible and everything looked good with the phone in their system when she looked up the phone's ID number. They mailed me a new sim card and walked me through over the phone on switching the new sim card. Everything worked well and my phone works fine on our Verizon plan. I saw other reviews of people in similar situations and wanted to confirm that Verizon's customer service was helpful and this unlocked phone worked for me on our Verizon plan by going through these steps. The Verizon store employees either do not have the power in store to recognize the phone or they tell you it is not compatible to try and get you to sign a contract through them and spend more money. Going through customer service was the way to go and within 4 days of getting the phone from Amazon, I got the new sim card from Verizon and my new phone is working great!
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: This phone is not completely outdated as of yet and is still extremely functional and affordable. I had been an iPhone user for many years but their idea of trying to get people to upgrade by killing off the battery and making apps not work because a phone is 2 years old is ridiculous. I refuse to pay $1000 for a phone.Cons: This is simply my opinion but it really has nothing to do with the phone itself. Getting used to working an Android OS again.Alongside with Amazon payment plan, you cannot go wrong with this phone.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall pretty nice phone. Being water resistant is a major plus, and the fact that the touch screen still mostly works while wet is amazing. It kind of stutters and lags a tiny bit which was disappointing. Battery life is hit or miss. Sometimes it lasts 2 days, and sometimes less than 1. Obviously that should be my fault for using apps that drain the battery but I can't figure out why it happens. I'm not a huge fan of the wrap around screen and it makes me really paranoid since almost no cases actually protect the sides. It could be cool technology when they do a 360 degree wrap around screen that covers the back as well, but in its current state I don't really get the point. It does look pretty though (is that the only point...?). Glare is kind of an issue. Bixby is completely awful and I can't believe Samsung locked out the button so people can't reprogram it to do something useful. I don't get why they're competing with Google on that front, and also don't understand why they're competing in the cloud storage market. Another wtf decision is why they include an awesome AMOLED screen but don't take advantage of the power saving features unless you install third party black themes.Major concern: Samsung Premium Care will not cover phones purchased from Amazon, but they will still accept your money. Super scummy move in my opinion. There was no mention of it until I asked a rep (and good thing I did).Despite my many complaints about Samsung's strange decision making, the hardware is pretty good and the stock OS works well with some tweaks.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just received my new phone in the mail! Looks real nice! Just found out that I have to have a sims card from Sprint (my service provider) in order to use it! Fortunately, they told me the sims card is free, and that I can either order one or go to the store and get it there! We shall see!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just got it and activated it a few days ago. I had to go to the Metro store and pay to get it activated (wouldn't let me do it online fur some reason), but it does work for Metro. Haven't tried the facial recognition yet, but the fingerprint seems to be working fine. Overall the phone is functioning the way it should in my opinion, but of any changes occur I'll try to remember to update my review.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I switched from an iPhone. Took a day to get used to Android and then I just felt free. The phone is light and thin with excellent screen real estate, fingerprint scanner, and a great camera. I was able to move my SIM card directly to this phone without any interaction with my carrier or their website. Samsung also provides a Smart Switch app that transferred most of my content to the new phone via USB cable. The phone comes with an adapter so you can just use your iPhone cord if you have one.
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This phone may be good but I wouldn’t know because I received a box that only included headphones and a cord. On top of that, I am told that I have to wait three days for them to complete an investigation. To say that I am pissed would be an understatement. As a paying customer, I expect more. The issue is between the warehouse and the shipper, and has nothing to do with me, yet, I am the one being punished.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sad.  Was looking forward to this phone and and opening, there were 2 piercings on the screen.  Guess buying from AT&T is better?Disappointed.  2nd item I have returned from Amazon in the last 5 years.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"For the most part this is worth the money.  There is a slight scratch on the screen that isn't noticeable unless you try to look at it. Other than a small scuff on the top edge of the phone (which you can't see with a case on) it is in great cosmetic condition.  Now the battery life is OK but not great.  Auccu Battery says that only 2,879/3,000mah is being used so my battery life isn't as what a new phone would be like. The battery also gets a little warm while playing video games such as PUBG on Recommened settings. But the thing about that is that the seller never told me that this phones battery was in the shape that it is in.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was sent an international phone and found out there was no warranty. Was refunded my money with no hassle. Other than that this phone is a great phone. It came in the original packaging and seemed brand new But fragile so get a case and tempered glass protector. I will be re-buying because I loved it . hopefully I will be sent the the proper phone this time.
            "
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Nothing wrong with this unlocked phone itself but it was not totally compatble with Verizon. Advanced calling features such as wifi calling, hd etc are not available. Also no 4g or 3g only lte. I do not recommend purchasing if you have verizon. Had to return phone and buy a phone with Verizon software.
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I should have spent more time looking into this phone. If you search - galaxy s8 searching for gps - you will find at the samsung support site entries dating from 5/11/2017 to today(2/6/2019) about its inability to function.  I have tried the vague solutions they offer without success.  Rare times after hitting start on google maps the directions work for about a minute or two, but never longer, and usually not at all. Messaging, email and gps directions are what I purchased this phone for. Avoid it if you need gps. Understand this is not directed at the seller, the seller performed as promised, quick delivery and as advertised.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"The phone was directly from Amazon Warehouse and was original. The weight and feel is great . Set up was easy. The was glitches so far or spontaneous restarting. Touch is good. There are lots of new features. The only problem was that notifications did not come in in real time in sleep mode....but, after digging around on the internet, I discovered that the battery usage and saving feature in special permissions was the problem. Works fine now.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this for the wife, as she had an S5 with 16 gig...and she was out of space and her text messages wouldn't come in.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Phone works great so far. I didn't realize it came with a screen protector installed on it so I kinda freaked out when I thought the phone was delivered with a crack all the way down the middle.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"The phone is great, but Bixby is nonresponsive the majority of the time when trying to use voice wake up. I've gone through the setup multiple times, but it still doesn't work. Google assistant wakes up with no problem so it's not the mic or me. Also Bixby works fine with the (poorly placed) Bixby button.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased a ""like new "" from Amazon with the Earth Day deal.I plugged in the phone and immediately saw the difference in display from my iPhone 7 and lightning fast response with beautiful curved glass.I was willing to forego a few features such as stereo speakers ,slow motion video and emoji characters to save over$300 compared to the S9 plus.After registration of my product with Samsung , 9 months left on the warranty, so phone was most likely a return because someone ordered the wrong product then sent it back.
            "
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros: The phone is fast.Good battery life.Very nice looking phone.Display looks very nice.Cons:  My hand would often unintentionally touch a part of the wrap around screen and close browser windows, apps, etc.  This happened often enough to be fairly annoying.Several apps were buggy and would close by themselves or would just not work at all (such as cycletrader app).  There were some annoying quirks with the youtube app.The fingerprint reader is the worst I've used yet, it always took at least 3 or 4 tries every time I got my phone out.  Super annoying.Facial recognition on this phone is a joke.I don't like Samsung's overlay on Android Nougat.  The Samsung keyboard sucks. Stock Android is so much nicer IMO.Overall, for a flagship phone and even at a deeply discounted price I wasn't too impressed with this one.  I have a feeling I would be much happier with a Pixel or the upcoming Pixel 2.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"the planned obsolescence of my s5 finally got to me so I bought the s8+ works good - wonder how long they will allow me to use it before they slow it down.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a pretty good phone and replaced a Moto X Pure.  It's sleek and attractive.  The hardware is beefy--64GB is more than enough for me.  And if I did need more, it's nice that I have the option of using a micro SD card.  The processor and ram have nice performance on apps.  Some people complain about the fingerprint sensor being near the camera.  Personally, I haven't had a problem with that.  Nor have I had a problem with the Bixby button, although it seems unnecessary.  The iris scanner, however, doesn't seem to work for me.  I'm just not using that function.The deduction of a star comes in Samsung's software.  It's not bad.  But there are going to be times where you are banging your head in frustration--'Why won't you let me do  ________?  or why won't you let me remove _______ from MY PHONE?'  For some people, that may be Bixby.  Personally I'm using it in conjunction with Google Assistant and that seems to be working well.  But for those that don't want it, you really shouldn't need 3rd party software to remove it.  Likewise, if you have an app that you prefer to use, then Samsung shouldn't place a barrier to keep you from removing their version.  It was great that they included some apps with a new phone; I get that.  But if I want to get rid of them in favor of something else, I shouldn't have to jump through hoops.And then there are odd situations like Samsung's built in Game Tools.  Now I'm not a heavy gamer, but there are times I'll mindlessly kill some time.  But that stinkin setting was adding 2 extra buttons on the navigation screen in the corners right near the game's buttons.  When I finally managed to kill the buttons, I was getting notifications all the time when the game started-up as well as inconvenient places in the game.  It took a $2.50 purchase for an app called BK Disabler to finally get rid of it.  It's not a lot in the scheme of things.  But man, what an aggravating experience for an otherwise solid & great phone!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best cell phone I've had. The colors are vibrant, the camera's great not to mention lots of features. I haven't used bixby due to the reviews but I'm fine without it.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Beautiful. Runs fast. Worked well with a SIM card transfer on Verizon networks, instantly. Lots of neat features like running multiple windows.Flimsiest thing I've ever seen.I'd owned a Droid Turbo 2 for years that stood up to all kinds of abuse until the battery finally permanently died; This thing cannot stand up to common usage. It had a screen fracture in less than a week after a maybe two-three foot drop even with a case/screen protector on. If you can be rough on tech, avoid the hell out of this phone.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I moved from an iPhone 6 to the Samsung S8 because of the recurring battery issues. The first thing I noticed about the Samsung S8 is the significantly longer battery life. The phone is not as user-friendly as the iPhone, but that might be more a function of having been a longtime iPhone user (my learning curve). The phone looks great, comes with a lot of great apps and is relatively easy to set up. There are some quirks that will take some time to get used to, but that's probably true for any new phone. Overall it's a great phone.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"So, the makers of this phone decided to add a personal assistant that pops up whenever you click a button on the side. I have everything integrated with Google and have no need for another personal assistant nor any desire to test one out. But, I constantly accidentally hit this button, and this thing that I have no desire/need for constantly pops up, usually right when you're in the middle of something.""But why don't you just disable it?"" you might say. Well, they make you sign up for an account and go through a whole process just to get to the screen where you can disable the button. So, after a month of aggravation, I finally decided to go through the hassle of disabling this stupid thing that I have not desire nor need for. Well, ok, I finally get it disabled, but having to give it my personal information and such, and who know what kind of data it's gathering. Not to mention power it uses, data it uses, and taking up a whole screen constantly to the left of the main screen. So, I decide to disable the app entire. Well, there's like 4 apps it uses, and you have to disable all of them. But, surprise, Samsung deliberately makes it impossible to disable.So, this all seems like a grand ploy to force you to use their personal assistant, and they figure that you've already bought the phone and won't go through the hassle of returning it, accustoming yourself with another phone, etc.. But take it from me, save yourself. Get a different phone now.

Don't pay over a grand on competition (cough cough ""X"") when this phone is absolutely INCREDIBLE at almost half the cost. I could go on and on... But seriously, I love this phone.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great deal on a flagship phone without needing to worry about the carrier bloatware. I was pleasantly surprised that the ""used"" phone I purchased is basically brand new besides some fairly faint scratches on the screen. Had no issues powering the device on out of the box, and it even came with a complimentary case.This is only receiving a star less because the USB C cable that shipped with it was broken on arrival. Not a big deal, but a bit of a headache when you need to charge the phone.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have the money, go for it. High performances, great pictures, good battery life, and comes with some useful Samsung software on top of the native android.The only drawback, is that battery optimization is so good, that prevent application like Strava from running properly by blocking its background access to resources.! So, if you are planning to use Strava, have a second thought.  Still it deserves 5 stars.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I chose this provider because I wanted an unlocked phone from a Samsung official provider that was advertised as being from the USA. I live overseas and it was important that I be able to use the phone in the USA and abroad.

            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Great hardware but two things that make it terrible. Software especially phone dailer is terrible compared to stock android. You have to have a separate app just to check your voicemail with the S8 vs a Pixel where it is included with the dailer and a breeze to use. It may not sound like much but spending extra time going to that app wastes a lot time over time.  Also that bixby thing is terrible.  They won't let you turn it off without a Samsung account that they use to track you.  It pops all the time but after a while you figure out how to get it to stop saying ""hello, this bixby"" and then you learn how to get it stopped right away. Once again a big waste of time but at least it becomes less of a pain.  But really, why put up with any pain when this phone costs over $600?  Skip it, keep your old phone if it still works or buy something else.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this for my son for Christmas. He loves it! It was easy to set up - he was able to transfer all his data, contacts, etc from his old phone very easily.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hope I can cut through all the confusion posted here about Verizon compatibility.  THIS MODEL DOES INDEED WORK ON VERIZON'S NETWORK.  When I received the phone, I charged it to 100%, but did NOT turn it on.  I then took it to a Verizon store.  After a beat down by the salesperson for buying an unlocked phone online, she proceeded to warn me that lately, Verizon has been ""refusing to activate unlocked phones"" not purchased through them.  However, after standing my ground, the salesperson backed down, retrieved a SIM card and activated my new S8.  Be persistent!Awesome phone with wonderful features - and pretty snappy, too!  Everything is working great.  It is nice to own a phone without all the bloatware pre-installed.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, from a hardware viewpoint this is an amazing handset. Stunning screen, sleek lines, all the sensors you would ever need, and some of the richest blacks I have seen from an AMOLED screen. Then ... Samsung goes and mucks the whole thing up with gobs of horrendous software that they lock down and won't let you disable. I literally JUST wanted to change my wallpaper image and the software refused to let me do it unless I updated to a new Samsung Themes market where they try and sell you themes. I just want to change the wallpaper for pete's sake!And the Bixby key? So many people don't want your Bixby key, plus Bixby makes it impossible to use google assistant from the lock screen. So Samsung adds the option to disable the Bixby key ... ONLY if you jump through all the hoops, creating a Samsung account, and letting them into every aspect of your phone. Nonsense. Just another data mining exercise. Then there is the Oreo update. I pay a premium for an Unlocked, from Samsung, handset ... then Verizon and T-mobile handsets get the update first. Really Samsung?? You're so far behind that the telcoms are beating you on major OS updates? A 200.00 Xaomi MI is a recognized Android One phone and gets the newest stuff immediately, but my 700.00 Samsung is months late? Seriously? If that is the case, then offer me a 50.00 USD plan to nix the special software nonsense and give me a stock Android experience. No Bixby, no 300 Samsung apps that I'll never use, and no locking my phone down to what YOU want me to do in an effort to mine my software.This will honestly be my last Samsung phone ... if I wanted a locked down experience I'd buy an iPhone. There is a very good reason why companies like Oneplus, Xaomi and Essential are getting a chunk of the market share, they are giving the customer what they want. A quality handset that isn't hobbled by software and apps they don't want and can't disable.At this point, I plan to see what the Oreo experience brings (if they ever get the freaking thing released) and unless they give us some control over the Bixby button and the option to use Google Assistant like it was designed, I'll sell this junk and buy a Oneplus 6. At least then I won't be controlled by a company, being told what I can and cannot do on a device that I bought and paid for. Frankly, there should be a law that Unlocked phones cannot contain software that isn't able to be disabled. I bought it, it's mine, don't tell me how to use it.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"The screen, camera, and overall build are phenomenal.The Samsung version of Android is complete crap. The only version of Android that should be put on flagships is the pure version, plain and simple. Why does Samsung still have a proprietary app for everything Google already does so well? Then I have to tell the phone that I want to use the Google version for every default app. Don't even get me started about the fact that Facebook is preinstalled and CAN'T BE UNINSTALLED. I don't even have a Facebook account.. You can't remap the Bixby button to Google Assistant without a third party app? I simply disabled it to prevent myself from accidentally opening that crap assistant. The software for a 2017 flagship is atrocious.One of the selling points of this phone for me was the SD card expansion option. I bought a 128 GB SD card and downloaded all my Spotify music for offline use and all was good. Until one day, about 2 weeks into owning the phone, the SD card reader simply stopped working. After checking out some forums I realized this is an issue that Samsung won't address. This was the straw that broke the camel's back and I couldn't forgive Samsung for all the things I didn't like about the phone. I sent it back within 2 weeks of owning it.If you want a pure Android experience with great hardware, this is not the phone for you. If you're switching from an iOS device, or simply aren't into customizing your experience AND you don't mind not having advertised SD card support, go for it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Yah it's a cool phone where the screen goes around the edge of the phone and the camera is nice, but do you like to use Snapchat or the internet? Do you like to download apps then go on wifi? Well with this phone you can't do any of those things. Don't believe me? Google it there are plenty of forums that say there are no fixes for these problems. A more recent problem I've discovered is if you're listening to music the music will just stop playing until you unplug and replug the headphones in.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great phone. It does most of what it's supposed to and is a huge upgrade from my S6. Took one star away since it advertises use of the fingerprint scanner as a means to take pictures with the front facing camera. It doesn't work. I called Samsung support many times and even got a replacement phone. Still didn't work. Face recognition doesn't work particularly well either. Iris scan is a better option and that works nicely.Not the phone's fault, but getting this thing from Amazon was a nightmare. Now I have to return the second one they sent out because it's no better than the first and actually a little worse in some ways (home button not as receptive, Bixby button finicky, and still no fingerprint shooting method). Still happy with my choice, but 3 stars seems appropriate.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"It really is a beautiful phone, and probably in the best family of phones out there.The Good:It looks amazing on the back and the screen. The curved display is very nice and only adds to the looks of the phone. The camera is epic and surprises me at every corner. The processing power is of course epic. Being able to record your heartrate, stress level and blood O2 level is nice.The Bad:For some reason you cannot change the notification sound, which is simply dumb. And you also cannot change what is on your lock screen, such as removing the clock, which is restricting.What I recommend is that if you want a new-ish phone, and don't want to play an absurd amount of money, watch the price of this phone until it is around 470$ and then buy it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"1. I was using it fine. One day failed to start. 2. Sent in for repair on 8/18/18. 3. Just got it back on 8/31/18. 4. Samsung did not fix it. The letter came with the phone said simply, ""unable to fix"" 5. Called Samsung. Was on hold for 32 min. After several transfers, I was told there was a liquid damage. 6. How can there be a liquid damage when it never went near water? 7. Isn't Samsung Galaxy S8 water resistant to begin with? 8. It took Samsung over 10 days to determine that there is a water damage? 9. I have had many Samsung products in the past. I have to confess it will take a lot for me to consider Samsung again.
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Received this phone 3 days ago, and finally got the SIM card from VZN.  Apparently, this phone has an issue with NOT being able to send sms texts.  Spent 2 hours in the Verizon store trying to get it sorted out.  2 factory resets, and 2 additional SIM cards - still will not send SMS texts.Besides the no texting problem, the other issues I found in the short time I had this phone is:-The new 'Bixby' feature is a huge disappointment.  Extra side button which is easily hit by holding the phone.Fingerprint reader is in an awkward position on the back of the camera.  Unable to use thumb print unless turning phone around.So, if you're just looking for an expensive phone without the ability to respond to texts, or constantly pulling up Samsung's attempt at AI whenever you pick up the phone - then this one is a winner.  If you're looking to actually use all of your phone's capabilities - then I suggest going elsewhere.I've been with Samsung since the Galaxy S1 days, and this is by far, the WORST phone I have ever encountered (and I even had the Note 7 for a short time).  Returning this POS.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love it.  It's a decent step up from my previous Galaxy (S6 Edge Plus).  The placement of the fingerprint scanner is my only gripe (next to the camera lens... really?) but the awesome retina scanner makes up for it.  I've read some say the retina scanner ""takes too long"", but mine unlocks consistently in under a second.This is a deceptively tough phone, but you'll want a case as it's pretty darn sleek.
            "
4.0 out of 5 stars,"ok so far
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This phone has great capabilities and sleek design. Even though I purchased the Otterbox screen protector, I couldn't put it on and have the phone still work. As a result, when my phone was accidentally knocked off a stand that was about 18 inches off the floor, the screen cracked. Now I'm getting flashing lights and I will have to replace the screen for $230. I've owned the phone for less than 4 months and it is already almost useless because of the crack that keeps spreading and the flashing light. This phone is extremely fragile and for the price, definitely not worth it.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"There is nothing I can complain about.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have owned the galaxy S2,S3, and S6(flat Display). With all of those phones I was happy from purchase, to replacement (usually fleeting battery life). I have just purchased two(one for me and my significant other) of the Galaxy S8+ phones, and am somewhat disappointed. I was reluctant to purchase at first because of the edge screen being forced upon me, but I could no longer deal with old phones. Here are some of the things I have noticed.Cons1. Screen glare - when in lit areas I seem to always have a glare on one side of the edge. Even in Samsung's display pictures there are glares on both sides of the screen. (hard to be unseen once noticed)2. Screen protectors - I have tried 3 so far none seem to like to stick to the screen well and two interfere with cases I've tried.3. Cases - Not a problem yet, but all the cases I have tried seem leave something to be desired in protection. A lot of the front of the phone seems uncovered.(very nerve racking, mostly due to curved screen)4. Finger print scanner - WHY OH WHY IS IT ON THE BACK? Next to the camera non the less. Unlocking with single hand can be a little tedious. Because hand placement for use, and unlocking it are different. Kind of have to slide it around your had to do one or other. Thick cases can make it hard to get proper finger placement.5. On screen buttons - I have had phones with them before, HTC M8. After about a year the phone slows a touch, and they seem to take a couple seconds to appear. May be an no issue with this in the future.Pros - (most other flagships are equal here)1. Battery - Very good battery life. After a day of moderate use its still over 40% remaining.2. Speed - A very fast phone, little to no lag launching apps.3. OS - I do like the Samsung version of android over some of the other companies. Probably because I've had so many of their devices.4. Camera - Very fast and great pictures. video recording is very high quality too.In conclusion, I would recommend looking at other options if you are on the fence about the infinity(edge) display.  I took a chance and do slightly regret it. I am currently stuck with the phone for most likely the next few months.Only way I'll buy a Samsung again is if,1. I can get a flat display again2. Take the buttons off the screen.3. Bring fingerprint scanner back to front.

Nice display, quick function, just a bit of a challenge to navigate around the phone. Imbedded apps are a pain, and slow the phone down. Google got it right with their Pixel 2. Aftermarket products are hit-or-miss for the S8, as many cases for this aren't very snug-fitting. READ the reviews for cases and accessories. Some really suck.

            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"This was the worst purchase I can recall making. Run, don't walk, away from this thing. The Android platform is what it is, and if you're looking in this space you are already OK with it vis a vis the IPhone. The real problem is the casing. It is absurdly delicate, and the screen is so configured that it presents a fragile curved glass edge rather than a hard plastic rim. While this feature no doubt increases screen capacity, it means that there is a very high likelihood you will break the screen with ordinary use. To this day I'm not sure how I broke mine. Once you do that, you are in a world of pain. You can't get screens from Samsung as an end user, and if you go through an approved repair facility you are in for a wait of a month or so, and a total cost to repair of roughly half of what you paid for the phone. Meanwhile, you don't have a phone. Handy. If I could go back in time and pay money to avoid making the mistake of getting this thing, I would gladly do it. As it stands, I am probably going to write it off and get an IPhone, from which I mistakenly switched in the first place.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Update:  New phone has arrived and is working great. Five starts for Amazon customer service,  4 stars for the phone(the first one was defective but if not for that, would be five stars)Like the phone while its working, seems to be quick and the pictures seem really nice,  I'm unfortunately one of the ones that have been affected by the constant restarting problem.  Two stars for now since Amazon customer service is replacing it,  once the new one gets here and it doesnt have the restarting problem(restarts at random 15-20 times a day) I'll update the score/review.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Galaxy itself is fantastic. I love the picture quality, which is most important to me. Apps and customization are also fantastic.

            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"There is NO IR Blaster!!!! Seriously, why this hardware was not included in the S8 is beyond me. Rediculous! This hardware has been included in cellphones for YEARSSS and has been included in Samsung Galaxy cellphones since the S4!!! Smh. This was not a feature I thought I needed to research. I have utilized the IR blaster in all my previous cellphones to control electronics at work and at home, TVs and Air Conditions mostly, and I am incredibly disappointed to find out, after buying an S8, that it is not built into this phone.
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"I had high hope for Samsung's flagship phone, but was very disappointed.The positives:1.  The phone has a headphone jack, an SD Card slot, and wireless charging.2.  The phone is unlocked and has the transmitters necessary to work on all four U.S. carriers.3.  The Wireless Hotspot feature works even if you don't pay your carrier for the privilege.4.  The Screen is sharp and bright, just like prior Galaxy phones.The negatives:1.  No hard button on the front.  I really appreciated that the earlier Galaxy phones that had a physical button.  I like the tactile feedback that a physical button gives you.  It allows you to wake your phone without having to look at it to make sure your hand is in the right place.  That tactile feedback is missing on this phone.  Also, on this phone, to wake the phone you must press the virtual button TWICE, then you must swipe, and then you must type in your passcode/PIN.  That means a total of FOUR actions just to get the phone to the home screen.  That's just stupid.2.  No user replaceable battery.  This is simply inexcusable.  I know that they big companies want you to throw away your phone every two years and buy a new one, but that is incredibly wasteful and unnecessary.  There is nothing about the design of this phone that mandates a battery that cannot be replaced by the user.  It would have been very easy to design the phone to have a user removable rear cover.  Even wireless charging can be accomplished with a user replaceable battery.  I had wireless charging on my Galaxy S3 and S4, both of which had a user replaceable battery.3.  Oddly sized:  This phone is too tall and too narrow.  As a result, it does not easily fit into my pocket and will fall out fairly easily as well.4.  Oddly shaped:  The waterfall feature on the screen has an appeal that's similar to the appeal of curved TV sets.  Initially, it looks interesting, but you quickly come to realize that it heightens glare and distorts the image.  In the case of this waterfall screen, it distorts the images at the edges.  It also makes it almost impossible to get a case that will protect the phone from screen damage when it is dropped.5.  Bixby Button:  Bixby is a Samsung's answer to Apple's Siri.  There's a dedicated Bixby button, which is located directly across from the power button, which makes it super easy to inadvertently push when you're pushing the power button.  Samsung just recently made it possible to disable, but not remap, the button.  But, in order to do so, you *must* create a Samsung account, share some personal information with Samsung, and link Bixby to the account.  Until you do that, you cannot get to the screen that allows you to disable the button.  Again, this is stupid.  If Bixby is so great, people will choose to use it.  Samsung shouldn't need to force people to do so.In the end, even though I got a smoking $574 Black Friday price on this phone from Amazon.com, I'm going to send it back and either keep my S6, or upgrade to S7 instead.
            "
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Despite reviews, the camera is not very good. Specifically, the native dynamic range is very limited, and the HDR feature seems to be faked in software (with poor results) as opposed to ""real"" HDR where multiple images are captured at different exposures and blended together into one.When shooting at night, areas around light bulbs are bleached. When shooting during the day in contrasty scenes, the blue sky is bleached white, even with the HDR mode on.My 2014 iPhone 6 plus does not have a problem capturing the dynamic range of these scenes without bleaching, and takes much better overall pictures (despite the lower pixel count) because it has real HDR that works well.I even tried a 3rd party true HDR camera app. But, in the darkest exposure setting the areas around light bulbs at night are bleached. Basically, the camera's hardware just doesn't have the range to do it.Also, the camera has awful halo effects at night, regardless of whether I use the stock camera app or the paid premium one. Streetlights, etc. have horizontal lines that run across the screen from end to end.I am thinking of getting rid of this brand new phone because the camera is so sub-par compared to my past iPhones. In fact, my iPhone 4S has a preferable camera in some ways because it does HDR properly.The 1080p video is also inferior to my 2014 iPhone 6 plus. There is a notable lack of detail and contrast in the videos. While it is encoded as 1080p, apparently due to compression artifacts or whatnot, there is a notable loss of detail that makes the result look like a good 480p shoot.And the audio for video, while fairly good, is also inferior to the 2014 Apple model. This is quite apparent when shooting at a concert.And, the S8 chews through battery rapidly, even with almost all app push notifications and auto updates turned off, and even with the phone in the middle battery saving mode with the processor and display throttled back. I couldn't get through a day in an amusement park without running out of battery.Lastly, while the OLED screen has stunning brightness and color gamut, the color accuracy is notably off. I found this to be occasionally irritating when watching movies, and it prevented me from accurately adjusting photos with photo editing apps.The phone is quite nice looking, and the iris scanner works better than I expected. The front facing camera the best I've yet seen. The cellular reception is slightly better than my old phone - i will get 1 bar in some places where I used to get ""no service.""Good phone all in all, but the camera flaws are a dealbreaker for me.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first ever written review, I was so dissatisfied I was compelled to write. I feel completely scammed and mislead by mention of the Warranty. I went to register my S8+ product with Samsung and was rejected. I attempted to register  using the S/N then IMEI. REJECTED BOTH. I would have been much more satisfied with a Chinese phone for a much cheaper price with ZERO Warranty. I purchased this phone ONLY for the promise of some form of warranty. WRONG. NOTHING.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"To be honest, I purchased this phone June 5th and have had nothing but problems with it since I bought it. The biggest problem, the battery and charging problems. Every time I let the phone get to 40% or less battery life, and plug it in, it automatically just shuts down completely. Not sleep, not screen off, SHUT DOWN. It has been crazy annoying but i dealt with it since it is the ""best phone out there"".Next, the always on screen. Sometimes it is literally ALWAYS ON. screen is on, at the main home screen, not the lock screen. Anyone can get into the phone, browse away and make calls if I a not watching. Also, in this state, if it isn't charging and I put it in my pocket, it actually heats my leg uncomfortably. The only solution is to hit the power button to put it to the lock screen. Very frustrating but I dealt with it because it is ""the best phone out there"".Now this morning i awoke to find the phone powered off. I assume the battery had dies so I plugged it in. Normally, as soon as it is plugged in you would see a circle with a lightning bolt inside that appears, letting you know it is at zero percent but it is charging. The LED light would also blink at the top....nothing. No LED light, no circle with lightning bolt, nothing. I then proceeded to spend 3 hours looking on the internet, calling Samsung, everything to try and rectify the issue. It just will not turn on.So now I get on the phone with Samsung and they have me go through 20 minutes of attempts to resolve the issue, the same things I just spent 3 hours trying. Still nothing. I also read in their warranty for cell phones (see attached screenshot) that ""During the applicable warranty period, provided the Product is returned in accordance with the terms of this Standard Limited Warranty, Samsung will repair or replace the Product, at Samsung’s sole option, without charge."" So i figured they would just ask the woman to overnight a replacement of this 5 month old phone and I would ship this broken one back, done....nope. The woman on the phone refused to even acknowledge replacing was an option even though I read her word for word what the warranty stated. The only option was to send it to them, wait for them to fix it, and then send it back. All of which will take 2 weeks! I replacement can be shipped in 2 days!. I asked her nicely again to replace it as I cannot be without a phone for 2 weeks, no; she wouldn't even consider it since she didn't believe it was in the warranty in the first place. After a 3rd try to get her to understand she simply got quiet as she refused to even discuss it with me any longer. Very disrespectful and lack of understanding of my situation or their warranty apparently  but also very disrespectful to a customer who has spent a fortune on Samsung products.So now I am sending the phone back to Samsung to let them spend 2 weeks to repair and send it back. In the interim I plan to buy another phone THAT WILL NOT BE SAMSUNG. I have been a Samsung fan for 4 years now and have spent close to $20,000 on phones, TVs, all new kitchen appliances. To be so mistreated after all of this loyalty is unbelievable. After tolerating all of nuisances with this phone and then to be told they cannot replace it but it must be sent in for repair for 2 weeks is just unacceptable. This is the reason why Samsung has peaked for me and will now be going downhill. As far I am concerned there will never be another Samsung product in my home and I will actively tell whoever will listen to stay away from this company who does not respect their customers loyalty.Unless this company makes this right I will get the phone back ,sell it and never even consider another Samsung product, period. The aggravation alone is worth 10 of these phones that cost Samsung less than 300 dollars to manufacturer. Losing a 20k customer is going to hurt. Further I plan to post this review anywhere I can so that as many people considering Samsung products understand the company and lack of customer focus.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Screen is very nice, and it is fast. The message app is bad, Bixby is bad. why is it that after you type your screen un lock code you must press ok. I had to take it to a Samsung service center to completely flash the software so my conversations would not magically go into mute mode.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been getting Samsung phones since the Galaxy S1. But when I got this phone the Bixby feature was a minor problem. After a month its gotten even more annoying the fact Bixby would come up and whats worse, is we can NOT reprogram or disable that button. Later on I realized there was a lot of other crap-ware Samsung was forcing on us that would popup up as well. The worst was when I wanted to take a video and yours truly Bixby vision came up and I missed the shot. There are other problems but all were minor what bothers me is the amount of small problems. Unless in the next Galaxy Samsung stops forcing crap-ware onto their phones this is the last Samsung phone I would ever get.

When I got this new S8+  I really liked this phone . I hated paying that much for a phone but I keep them a long time . The huge problem I'm having with the S8+is the reception sucks. One to two bars if I'm lucky and it constantly drops calls and fails to send text. I really like this phone so bit the bullet and purchased a cell phone extender antenna for version . Another $130 added and a real pain to install. After all this it's not better if anything it's worse.  IS THIS PHONE WORTH IT ? Srue .....That is if you don't mind running out in the middle of the street when it's snowingjust to make a call. Yes I'm being sarcastic and yes this phone is a joke!
            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't get me wrong, the functionality of this phone is incredible. However, the phone might as well come with a broken screen. This is the first phone that I have ever broken. And within 3 months of owning it, I have broken the screen twice. Both times were low impact falls from heights of about 2 feet while sitting. Furthermore, it breaks through a case, which is even more baffling.The phone is absolutely beautiful out of the box but once it inevitably breaks, you're left with an item that you just paid $400 - $800 feeling like you're trying to wait out a contract until your next upgrade is available. It would be nice to just fix the screen that Samsung should honestly feel ashamed about but that costs $150 - $200 unless you do it yourself. And then you are right back at square one with a new fragile screen not suitable for a device that is considered ""mobile.""I plan on coughing up the deductible to file an insurance claim on the phone. Mostly because the second break occurred in a way that a shard of glass is now impressing the screen preventing me from escaping a black screen while on a phone call. It otherwise works but I cannot look at texts/internet or even hang-up while taking a call.I would strongly advise against buying this phone. Even though I enjoyed my 3 months of use, I wish I had not bought it. Its pretty disappointing that Samsung is not remedying the fagility of this phone in mass. It's comical that a purchaser needs to constantly worry about a $200 bill while using this phone in a fairly standard way. The iPhone X is also a frightening phone since it looks like the same design. I would be exceedingly hesitant to buy anything that even remotely resembles this design in the future.

            "
1.0 out of 5 stars,"The features are alright, but nothing amazing. The Bixby button is just in the way and almost wholly useless. No screen protectors will stay on the damn thing and my screen was broken within 3 weeks because my kid leaned on the sofa and it slid onto my floor. My carpeted floor. This was a phone in an Otterbox case with a screen protector on (I believe it was the 3rd I'd purchased in just as many weeks since they don't stay on.). I took it in since I paid for insurance and they wanted to charge me my firstborn to give me a refurb phone. I decided to call around and it's about $500 for a replacement screen.I'm not particularly hard on phones and always keep them in a case and with a protector because I don't like having to replace overpriced gadgets. The only time I've had a cracked screen in all my years of phone ownership was when the entire strap broke on my bag and my Note 4 wound up with a cracked corner from like 3 tons of books falling on it on a subway platform. If I had any idea that the entire screen would be spider veined from sliding off the front of my sofa onto carpet, there's NO way I'd have bought this. I'm not a fan of the curved edges at all and wish they had a flat version because I really do like Samsung products for the most part. This one, however, is just a dud. It's way too fragile (and repairs WAY too expensive) to be useful to everyday folks. I've gone back to my old phone for now because I can't afford to pay to have it fixed in a repair shop and even the $200 deductible on the insurance policy just isn't worth it for a device that will likely break again if falling 2 ft onto carpet is enough to send it to the ER.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Just an average phone. The selling point being that it's an ""edge"" is kinda pointless being that most cases cover up around the edges. Gets in the way of some video formats, covering the bar. And the screen protector helps but because of the ""Edge"" it leaves the sides exposed. Now the case will cover it as I said, however it will also slowly peel the Screen protector off. And believe me you are gonna need that case. All the protection you can get. Had a foot drop, not only do I have a cracked screen but an actual hole. Waterproof selling point out the window. With such a high maintenance phone, idk why you would have it near water in the first place. Had this for a few weeks, battery was great until recently,  drains more quickly now. Damn ridiculous. (Update: beside battery continues to diminish it total life span, now having trouble shooting and storing photos. They become corrupted) I'm done with this phone, should of given LG a chance.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using Samsung phones for 10 yrs.They have made advancements with the S8+, which I truly enjoy however there are too many draw backs for me.The bixby feature is awesome, it took a while to really get use out of bixby for me. You really have to use it in order for it to learn and be useful. I recommend setting it up and going through the prompts, play with it for an hour or two. Set up short cuts. I found that ""take me home"" phrase I used when asking the previous assistant Galaxy to navigate home, does not work on bixby unless you set up a short cut. I do not however like the button. I find myself accidentally hitting the button all the time which disrupts what I'm doing on my phone because then you must wait for the bixby home page to load before you may close out.Two major complaints:The battery. I was blown away by the battery life when I first got my S8+! I've read a lot about battery preservation so I do not charge my phone while I'm sleeping because leaving it on the charger when it's fully charged kills the battery longevity. So I charge a couple hours a day while I'm at work and that's it. I stream music in the car so I expected that to drain the battery quickly but it did not! After exactly 6 months of use, my phone now loses about 30/40% just sitting idle while I don't use it in just about 3 hours. When I noticed this draining battery issue I immediately took action. I deleted every app that I don't use on a weekly basis. I set up the power saving mode. I changed screen settings. It has helped a little bit but not enough to really make a difference. I now have to charge my phone constantly.Because of the very iPhone-esk style they took begining with the S7, the phone now has a glass back that is not removable. Making the purchase of a new battery to fix said problem impossible. I've always liked samsungs products..but this was a poor decision for their consumers.The screen. While the screen is beautiful and ""unboxed""...it is 10x more fragile than any other Samsung or Galaxy I have owned. I cracked my screen within two weeks of ourchase. I was and still am, unable to find a tempered glass screen protector with a fully adhesive screen (because of the new design with the edge). I have sworn by tempered glass screen protectors in the past, they have saved me so many times. I was also unable to find one for the S7 as well. I did purchase one that only adhered on the edges, which did exactly what I thought it would.  It slid off the couch onto carpet and the screen popped right off the phone. Which for the record does nothing to absorb shock and prevent damage. I have the OtterBox symmetry case on my phone and it still cracked when dropped. Right on the stupid edge of the screen where it curves. Then a few months later, it slides off a shelf in the restroom and lands on tile flooring. Shatters again. I have shattered 3 out of the 4 corners on my screen all while in a case. I'd hate to see what happens when it's not in a case.Overall I am disappointed with this new screen, while it is beautiful and excellent for my photography hobby...it just isn't durable or practical. While the new technology advancements Android has made are excellent, I absolutely hate the quality of the phone. It's literally an $800 glass box around a computer.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"The phone is fine. Exactly what Samsung says it is. Here's what makes it awful. Carriers will not offer coverage for full service area to an unlocked phone not purchased through them. The charges for service are the same, but the service area is limited, making an independent purchase a bad decision. Carriers say it is a chip issue. That's a lie. It is a very easy thing to provide complete coverage for all customers regardless of their phones.

I watched every YouTube video I could find about this problem and couldn't find anything helpful. The phone is a lemon. Reset phone. Charged for 1.5 hours. Reset again and again. Do not recommend.

We take a look at the design, screen, Touch Wiz, OS, camera, video and audio playback and more. I've been using this as my daily driver and did my best to share my experience.The short version, if you don't want to watch the entire video - love it. One of the best looking phones out there with an awesome screen, camera, and overall performance. Plus it's water resistant and has tons of features.

There is no plastic wrap around the phone, it does look used; the package didn't deliver on time and there is no bubble bag to protect the item during delivery. Anyway, after I finish setup everything on the phone; I pulled out the headphone that comes with it to test - the volume adjustment is messed up. it doesn't work correctly. the lower button didn't work at all. I would have return this item if I didn't spend 3 - 4 hours setting up and messing around with it. I paid the full price and expecting a brand new phone.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Are you on ios and wondering how difficult jumping ship to the android flagship phones would be?  Well, that is exactly what I did and here is my experience.I'm starting with my Conclusion because this is long: I love the hardware aspect of the Galaxy S8+ with very few exceptions. It's a beautiful phone. After a couple of weeks I have my phone useable with fairly similar apps and functions I used on iPhone. I like quite a bit of the additional functionality and customization offered. However, using the phone is like having every developer trying to turn the phone into a personal billboard trying to sell me something unless I'm willing to shell out $2 to $3 per app in most cases. To gain some of the higher end customization without ads can cost $5 or more in many cases.  It is quite a bit less efficient in every day use due to lack of streamlined integration between apps and additional ads.ABOUT MEI have pretty much used ios for all my smartphone and tablet needs for about 8 years (or whenever iPhone 3gs came out - I'm 99% sure it was before 2010).  I tested an android tablet for about 5 years ago and I was not impressed with the weight of the device nor the android apps so I stayed with ios.  I'm pretty sure after that experience is when I purchased my first iPad.  About a month ago I had a water incident with my iphone 6 plus and had to decide what phone to upgrade to.My motivation is because there are so many exciting phones in the near future, the Samsung reviews are extremely positive, and the Samsung S8+ is so much cheaper than the iphone 7+ after just months of being on the market (and I don't think this trend will change anytime soon). I jumped ship from ios so I could make a better decision about the next iPhone before its release (iPhone 8+ or whatever they name it).  I've used the Samsung Galaxy Plus phone exclusively for about 3 weeks. Here is what I struggled with, my suggestions for non-android users, what I've learned about android ecosystem, the pros and cons post switching, and what I will likely choose next.PHONE DESIGNBig Pro - This phone design makes people drool. It looks great and it feel great in the hand - especially when you compare the plus size versions.  I could have gone with the plain size of this phone and been absolutely happy. My eyesight isn't that great so the larger screen is great.Pro - The size of the phone is great in the hand.  The smaller one is even better. It feels better than iPhone Plus in the pocket, however the height is about the same so short pockets still cause issues.Pro - Build quality seems top of the line. Buttons work great, etc.Pro - I like the color options better than other phones out there.Meh - Expected to be a fingerprint magnet - and it is. LOLCon - The hard to reach finger scanner on back - I type the unlock code OFTEN due to placement.Con - Dedicated Bixby button - this button is just in the way; its placement causes accidental Bixby engagement all the time and Samsung has locked users out of reassigning the button.PERFORMANCE/BATTERYPro/Meh - In terms of speed the OS (Android Nougat I believe) on this device has come quite a long way. Overall I found the OS response almost on par with ios.  I understand the difference between open architecture and Apple's closed architecture, so this is a great achievement but it doesn't outperform ios in my use so I can't mark it as a clear Pro. It felt capable in every way. It didn't glitch in a way that I didn't find acceptable but ios still wins here.Pro - The ability to change performance modes is nice for increasing battery life or performance. I don't play any high performance games, but the gaming folder options to set the phone as a priority for gaming (no interruptions and high performance) may be the reason for some users to choose this over iPhone.Pro - Quick charging and wireless charging are nice to have available (although I dont have those set up in my house).Meh - With the customization of this phone, it is easy to affect battery life without realizing it. In real day to day useage, I don't have all my charging stations set up for this phones usb c connector - I have iPhone chargers set up in many rooms of my house out of necessity. With most of the usb chargers I have, I dont feel this phone charges much faster than my iPhone. In my experience so far the phone underestimates how long it will take to get to a full charge by quite a bit maybe 20 or 30 percent. The good part is that I don't think it will be any worse than using my iPhone - but I'm not charging this thing any less either.DURABILITYBig Pro - Waterproof. Since my last phone died due water and I was always putting my phone in a ziplock bag to run when weather was questionable or out at the lake, this is something I am glad to have.Meh - Screen glass is marketed to be pretty scratchproof. I've ordered a screen protector and I tried to keep the film on the glass while waiting for it to arrive, but the film didnt stay adhered but 4 days or so.  I've been careful and only carry the phone in my pocket by itself and I have a scratch. I've never scratched a phones screen this quickly but there are so many factors that I won't list it as a con.Meh - I cant speak to back durability personally since I was able to find protector quickly and have not dropped the phone. But videos online show that the back can crack if dropped on concrete from only 3 feet which is about waist height. Although other drop tests show it surviving drops from 5 feet, most crack the backglass at this height. Drop tests online seem to indicate decent front durability often surviving a 5 foot drop. From what I've researched, the front seems as durable as (if not a bit more than) an iPhone and the back really dictates a cover.SCREENPro - The screen resolution is great. I do like the screen, but in use at mid arms length away I can't tell much difference with the resolution at max or the mid setting. I appreciate the ability to run mine at the mid setting to save battery life.Big Pro - I stream movies on my phone often and getting a larger video with a more narrow phone is a GREAT experience.Pro - The curved glass is just sexy on electronics. The screens edge does a great job of ignoring touches when holding the phone. That edge is visible when the phone is face down so it can be set for notifications and I've seen the ability to run a stock ticker down it.Pro - Always on display with very little battery impact. I didn't realize how often I turn on my phone just to see the time or even date. Once this is set to disply the things you are 'just checking,' you will save some battery life.Con - The screen seems VERY dim in comparison to iPhone. It is capable of a comfortable brightness, but when maxed out I feel like I'm using a reduced setting from my iPhone.CAMERAPro - That damn camera bump is gone!!! This phone will sit flat on the table - nuff said if you are using an iPhone.Pro - The cameras (hardware) on this phone are best in class.  I give this phone the edge because in low light, it captures more light than any Apple phone.  In bright light, it's a draw unless you truly have need of the 2 cameras on the iphone.  In my use, my cropped images come out great so a 2nd lens doesn't add the same value as low light performance.  My video needs are the same - I need more low light performance than ability to use a different lens.MEH - I'm not labeling this a con on purpose.  I know there is a phone out there with 2 backfacing lenses. 2 lenses do not make me want that bump on the back of my phone.STORAGEPro - You get a respectable 64 Gig onboard and can add a card (whenever you need it) to increase it at a reasonable price using standard 3rd party memory cards.  None of that bulls**t Apple gouging.PORTS/BLUETOOTHPro - Its accessories are all generic. It is so nice to buy an extra cable for $2. I know I can buy 3rd party apple cables but some fit well and some are so tight you may damage the phone. I LOVE not having to deal with that - although switching all my phone docks and cables did cost a few bucks. If the next iPhone switches its port, I wouldn't be able to use them anyway.Pro - The earphone jack. I am no audiophile and have gone wireless for audio in most ways. But by design, my car connects phones to the radio with an audio cable. This phone requires nothing new to use that. Its an added plus when I forget to charge my wireless headphones.Con - The usb c connection just doesn't feel as tight to me.  When I connect the cable it doesnt align straight as easily as the lightning connector - even with using the cables provided with phone. Also, I get errors from different chargers that the phone is not connected completely. I think the error is because the phone is expecting a fast charger, but it has me a little concerned about reliability in the back of my mind.AUTHENTICATION/SECURITYPro - Eyescanner is great for unlocking phone. I've had better restults than many reviews. Mine will usually scan me correctly from a reading position if I pull the phone up toward my face about 2 feet. Even in dim light it usually reads which greatly reduces this next con.Con - I am sooo used to the fingerscanner, it is an unatural action to unlock ANYTHING on this phone. The placement is not where I can reach it naturally so I have to shift the phone to scan and it has gotten to be a real pain in the ass when I unlock apps.Con - Eyescanner either does not work to unlock apps (like paypal, etc) or it isn't coded in a way to easily connect it. It seem to only unlock phone.Con - Did I mention logging into apps is a pain in the ass on this phone? Dashlane is an app that makes this a bit more bearable but once you know how easy it is on Apple it is hardly comparable replacment. If you use financial apps, you will dedicate some time to trying to get around this. I think on the standard phone the fingerprint scanner felt more accessible so this may be an issue specific to the plus model.Meh - Facescanner is available but a photo can unlock the phone. As easily hacked as this is, I don't see the point of using this. Maybe if I wanted to lock a younger child out of my phone. Anyone over the age of 8 that wants to get into your phone will get past this lock.Meh - I generally don't feel as secure with my data in the apps, OS, and features of this phone and the android infrastructure. Many find this a pro since you can choose all these different apps to help. It is the same feeling when I use my windows computer, security is all on my shoulders and I better address it someway. And all the free solutions have ads. Apple has a great track record with securing data, privacy, etc. Everything I read about setting up android points you to security features to enable. Am I protected? I've installed some suggested apps, but who the hell knows.CUSTOMIZATIONPro - Out of the box, this phone is one of the most highly customizable phones available to change your experience to how you want the phone to look and behave. You can add and remove features of the OS (like the app drawer which iphone users do not have), edit how app icon looks, rename or remove app names, etc. Some customizations are pretty sweet - like backgrounds can move with movement of the phone and the camera can be used to sync the background with whatever colors the camera is capturing.Pro - The keyboard can be reduced in size and offset to the side of your prominent hand so that the keys are easy to reach with one hand. If the Big Con for word prediction didnt exist, this might be a reason to change phones when using plus size.Meh - Speech of OS. It is good but Apple does relistic speech better.Con (if new to android) - It is overwhelming to use this phone out of the box without some grounding first. It may be licensing or userbase expectation, but there are dual applications for many functions. It is preinstalled with Samsungs version of chat, email, and browser apps as well as the Android standard equivilent. As you set these up and start using them, they'll be prompting back and forth to change defaults. Some are similarly named and the functions between each have nothing dictating where the app settings will be located, how to engage the settings, etc. The OS does not have any wizard guiding you through steps in an order that makes sense. Apple sort of walks you through step by step of creating your Apple account first, then security choices, etc. You get none of that here. You keep tinkering with creating accounts and settings until something works, then you move onto the next thing you want to work. It may take a week to get this phone to replace an iPhone completely if you use many apps at all.Big Con - Using the keyboard drives me close to insanity because of how often the wrong word appears. It is functional (I've defaulted to using Gboard after some comparing of 3rd party) but it takes about twice the effort as iPhone. If I hadn't used iPhone I likely wouldn't notice but I have used one and I notice this fault - every time I have to type an email or text message.Con - I have some loss in trust in settings to take and work as expected. I've had this phone ring at work when I thought I had do not disturb set. I do not know why the setting changed and it was easy enough to address, but you must click and look for check marks, okays, enable, save buttons that iPhone never requires you to click.  There is no standard across the platform so unless you exit and go back into a setting, I never know it took.Big Con (for my use) - Enabling handicap features can be painful. On iPhone, I can set my phone up to triple tap to enable text to speech so the OS will read aloud to me. I use this very often to have kindle books read to me without having to rely on audible or paying for whispersync books. Enabling this on android is very difficult and it will not continue to read past a paragraph max. If someone has figured this out, please respond with comment.Big Big Big Con - Ads, ads, everywhere. Do you like having your phone boot into a screen with a big ad displayed in the middle of it? Well android provides that functionality - in fact every developer over uses it in a way iPhone users do not experience. Once you customize and get some crazy ad resulting, you'll need an app to find what is causing it. In fact, I almost returned this phone on day 2 because of an ad. And I got some good advice I'm passing along to you if you keep reading.FUNCTIONSPro - Best 3d experience available on a phone. For under $10 you can get a 3d headset for your phone and be immersed in some pretty awsome videos. Yes, iPhone does this too, but Samsung does it better. What I did not know is that the experience is 360 degrees. You'll need to stand up to turn around and see what is behind you, but when you are flying in that jet, you can see the pilot if you turn around. I watched a cartoon with aliens in front of me and rabbit hiding behind me and I missed half of the action because I kept trying to check what the rabbit was doing. This is not something I need to have in anyway, but it is fun and costs very little to get set up. Be forewarned, you will be seasick after your first use and riding a rollercoaster standing up in 3d can make you fall down.Pro - Audio over wireless just sounds better to me compared to iPhone 6. I don't know about other versions but with same headsets I get more bass, etc.Meh - Phone calls are okay but I'm not impressed with the app. It is harder to use and integration between apps is not all that great. Here are some of the items harder than iPhone - answering a call, finding and calling a contact, setting up a 3way call, adding a new call into a current call (still haven't gotten it to happen), selecting a phone number in another app and having phone app open and call.Meh - Bixby is Samsungs response to Siri (and Google Assistant which is on this phone also).  In concept Bixby should develop into something more useful than Siri for chaining commands together (set this setting and opne this app, or open this app and do this), but it is not fully realized yet. Having to hold the button for the duration of the command comes difficult to me and it feels unnecessary and I just don't like it. And I don't like that button anyway. Engaging google assistant is the same as Siri and I like that way of turning it on better. I've used Siri more so I know what to expect and I know what it does. I have less favorable results with both of these but Bixby was only recently enabled. I think it may develop into something pretty nice to use if Samsung will rethink that button and the requirement to hold it for the duration of the command. And honestly about half the time I've clicked on the Bixby button, I was trying to hold my phone or adjust my volume - bad placment.Con - One better like clicking okay and yes to use these apps. Android suffers from the same thing Windows does. You have to click an extra time or 2 to get a function to set. Even when logging in right now, I may have to push the home button, then swipe up, enter a code, and then click an ok to proceed. On my iphone, I pushed the home button and let my finger rest there and I was in. The majority of system settings and apps have similar unneccessary extra selections and swipes.Con - Speech to text in voice assistants, text message or email is truly unpredictable. I did not truly appreciate how well Apple does this until I stopped using it on this phone. It is really that bad in most real life situations that I want to use it.Big Con - There is an emergency call button (it will dial 911 if you click it) that is badly placed on the unlock screen. I conciously have to avoid hitting that stupid thing 20 to 40 times a day. It's these things that seriously puts iPhone ahead of Samsung in actual usage.  I don't have issue with it there, but I need option to move it up on screen where I won't accidentally hit it. I CANNOT BE THE ONLY PERSON THAT HATES THIS.Big Con - Audio volume is ok for music apps but it has an annoying warning about excessive volumes damaging hearing that I want to disable forever and it won't let me. I wouldn't mind seeing the warning and have it go away in a couple of seconds, but you must interact with the warning manually. It is especially irritating because of this next big con.Con - Audio in apps are extremely low when using cabled headsets and at least some on wireless. One example is podcast apps. I have to max out the phone volume and increase my car stereo volume to hear them at the same volume of songs. I use a jabra headset when driving in my car - it's what I used to use with my iPhone and the same issue is present with it. I don't know how many apps are affected, and it may be setting related, but it is an issue out of the box.Con - Videos do not go full screen by flipping screen sideways. In almost every instance iPhone does this by default. It is not the case here - ofen it takes a click or 2 to get that to take.APPSPro - Multiple app stores to download products.Pro - Because android allows more access to hardware and OS, there are apps for a whole different use than what Apple apps provide. There are many apps to add functionality to the phone. The phone can go into silent mode or reduce its volume anytime you arrive at work for example. You can change your icons from developer default to marbles with the app name listed on them.Meh - Apps are mostly as functional as what IOS equivilent provides, but they aren't streamlined for ease of use. I miss my iPhone apps quite a bit.Con - Most underground app stores likely have viruses in part of their offered apps.Con - Most free apps have ads.Big Con - Unless you are willing to download apps from 'risky' locations, apps without ads are double or triple the price on Apple. I rarely see any paid for app include an ad but I see many paid for apps include apps after purchase.UNTESTEDNA - Provided headphones. They are marketed to be $100 street value but I use wireless audio and haven't had the need to test yet.And here are my suggestions for those not used to Android:Don't do as I did. As soon as I got basics down (before I sorted out what I needed to work), I hit the store and got lost in downloading free apps. Before I knew it I had a bunch of apps I didn't remember the function for and I included a launcher that sounded soooo great.  And then I figured out what came with those downloads - apps. I was UNHAPPY for a day with an app on my home screen. It was from the launcher by the way. The launcher made me about half crazy trying to work against it. So, if you are stuck in this mode, uninstall, uninstall, uninstall. Airpush Detector is an app that can help identify sources of ads.Stay with Samsung's default touchwiz launcher at first.  A launcher gives you a look and feel to the device and determines what functions you can add and remove from the settings.  When new to android, touchwiz gives plenty to play with and see what is available and you don't get embedded ads up front.Put the settings app somewhere you can find it easily.By default, the touchwiz launcher gives you a main landing screen that has a google search field and the primary row of phone related apps you see on every screen and one seconadary row of icons that belongs to this landing screen only. When you scroll to the right, the primary row will go with the view and the secondary will go offscreen with the rest of that landing screen. The idea is that the apps on the secondary row are your most frequently used apps along with the main phone apps on the primary row. When you scroll to the screen to the right, that screen is similar to what iPhone screens look like - a grid for placing apps over a chosen background. Each time you scroll to the right you can add one of these grid screens as iPhone does. Something not found on iPhone is an app drawer. It is available from each screen, if you swipe upward on the primary row - there is an up arrow on the primary row indicating the app drawer and you can choose to keep or remove a dedicated button that opens it as well. That drawer has a default copy of every app installed on the phone. If you want one on any of the main screens, press and hold an app inside the app drawer and it will let you pull it upward out of the drawer and it will drop to whatever location you release it at. The copy will remain in the drawer unless you explicitely delete or hide it from there.If you already know you don't like the app drawer concept, you can remove it and the upward screen swipe function will go away and all installed apps will drop onto the those grid screens - just like how iPhone behaves. If you are getting lost looking for apps, go ahead and remove the app drawer now to get closer to the iPhone default setup: Settings app icon > Display > Home screen > Home screen layout.  I suggest adding it back at a later date to see if you like it later; once there isn't so much to get used to at once.You likely are used to having a set of apps on the main row of your homescreen from whatever smart phone you come from. Change the row of apps on the primary row to match what you currently use and set those apps up for use.The timeout to black out the screen is way too fast when one is trying to figure out how to configure the phone. Go to settings and change setting not to lock if looking at screen.  Bixby can help find - just hold the button and ask to change that setting. If you have no Samsung account, you get to set up your account now.The phone is likely completely unlocked to anyone - you should set up security at some point - I suggest setting the passcode, the fingerprint scanner & the iris scanner. You'll be unlocking the phone once you do this, so decide if you want to do this now or later.The phone comes with 2 app stores installed, they are Samsung Market and Google Playstore.  I do not group my apps by developer. I group them by what they do. I suggest you pull the apps out of any folders they are in and put the near each other.  I usually look in the Samsung Marker first to see if there is a version of an app developed specifically for this phone and if not, I look in Google Playstore which will be developed for android phones in general.Next get some sort of security on the phone. Most carriers will have some sort of security app pre-installed. Launch it and make sure it is set up. I also installed Avast from one of the app store due to its popularity across android forums.If you are like me, you now have lots of apps running in the background. Press the dedicated recent softkey next to the home button. It is indicated by 2 arrows making a box. You can close them all.Initially, I was getting confused by apps provided to do same thing. Select an app for each function and remove the other app.Messaging clients: I hid Messages (it wont uninstall) & stayed with message+ until I could navigate the OS easily.Browsers: This is a difficult choice. Samsung Internet(purple globe) is designed to be integrated with this phones hardware and shows to be most similar to iPhone's browser for efficiency.  In my usage, it blocked sites that Chrome didn't and that I didn't feel were unsafe.  If you have no preference and gmail isn't your default form of communicating, I'd disable Chrome (no uninstall available) unless you have same issue I had. If you are tied to gmail, I'd use Chrome and hide/uninstall Internet if it'll let you.If you were using an iPhone before, Samsung has provided an app called Smart Switch to hook to your iPhone with provided hardware in the box (the one with the usb hookup adapter) and it will scan your iPhone and set up your contacts, move your photos if you have room, and find matching apps from the stores.  I'd run that at this time.Now go find a free background or theme you like in one of the stores.Select what displays on your always on display.Set up your apps and you should be set to use the phone for a bit.Once you are comfortable using all that you have set up - maybe a day or 2, set up the edge app. You'll have a better idea by that time what might be nice to have on that shortcut.Other Suggestions:Set do not disturb on a schedule (in the settings app) if you get woken up by text messages and such at night.Block blue light with sunset (in the settings app) - supposedly reduces affects of phone screen on your sleep.Set finger scanner to swipe down to pull notifications open - honestly I dont use it, but go ahead - it's kind of cool.Note:You cannot delete apps that are sitting on the primary apps bar - you must relocate it to the grid. Depending on app, it may not allow uninstall, but you may be able to disable and/or hide.  Worst case, make a folder and hide all unused apps in it.After a few days, research what a widget is and set one up on one of your screens - Maybe a calendar or a clock.After a few more days, research what ""edge"" apps are available to you.Some apps that I'm using:Ad source finder- air push detector (suggested by coworker)Downloaded & changed keyboard to GBoard (suggested by forums and tested well against others I tried)Ad blocker - Crystal Ad blocker (can't remember why I chose this)Pw manager - Dashlane shows up top in many reviews (you have to engage the app to set up the pw)Browser - Puffin pro (free has ads) for speed of use - but it has a drawback of memory consumption compared to other browsersChat client - Textra (mainly testing from high reviews)Widget - I'm using a widget called Month to put a calendar on one of my grid screens.

The only good thing about this transaction was my prompt refund.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Very disappointing battery life just like my old Galaxy S5. Why can't Samsung make the charger port micro usb like everyone else on the planet (except Crapple, of course)? At least they do provide an adapter with the phone which is easily lost. Sin cards are not backwards compatible with old Galaxy S models which cost me an extra $25 for a new sim card to make this phone operational.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a long time Galaxy user.  My whole family and I have had Samsung Galaxies since the S3.  But this S8 annoys me to no end.  They are turning the Galaxy into an iPhone.  If I wanted form over function, silly proprietary annoyances just for the sake of an advertising image -- well, I would have bought an iPhone.  But I didn't.Battery:  I have had this S8 for 9 weeks now.  I cannot make it through the day without the phone dying.  That's bad enough.  But far, far worse is the fact that the battery cannot be changed. Lack of interchangeable batteries has long been the Achilles heel of iPhones.  iPhone users constantly complain about it.  So what does Samsung do?  Make a new model with a sealed, non-changeable battery.  So I guess we're supposed to just throw our $750 phone away once the battery goes bad. If all the other Galaxies has interchangeable batteries, and all us users loved it, why would you even consider removing that much-loved feature?  And don't tell me for waterproofing.  I don't care.  You should be able to figure that out.All-Glass Case:  Are you kidding me?  If you look at the phone wrong, it will break.  And it's unbelievably slippery.  Nice combination -- slippery, made of breakable glass, front and back.  People are breaking their phones between the time they get it at the T-Mobile store and the time Amazon Prime can deliver a protective case. And even with a case, it'll break. I mean come on, the whole thing is made of glass.  Of course it's going to break.Proprietary charging port:  The Galaxy S5 had a USB 3.0.  That was genius, seriously.  The S5 was universally compatible -- including backwards compatible with USB 2.0, which means practically every charging cable in the world could be used to charge it.  In addition, USB 3.0 is super fast for data transfers.  So, what does Samsung do?  Create a new, proprietary cable connection that doesn't exist anywhere else on any piece of technology ever invented.  What a great idea -- let's turn the best charging system into the worst.  And that's even worse than Apple.  iPhones are known for their unusable proprietary features, but at least there are lots of different iPhones that use their proprietary cable.  In this case, only the S8 uses this useless connection.Infinity Display:  Samsung touts the ""uninterrupted surface that flows seamlessly over the edges"".  Okay, one question.  Did anyone actually hold this phone in their hand before bringing it to market?  Because if they had, they would know that your hand cannot hold the phone without touching the ""seamless edges."" Obviously.  So, various parts of your hand are constantly interfering with the function of the phone. So, just holding the phone, my hand is constantly fighting with my fingers for control of the phone.  I'd like to know -- who was asking for their phone to be turned into an infinity pool?  In case someone from Samsung is reading this, let me answer the rhetorical question: NO ONE.  No one cares that their phone wraps around the edge if it interferes with the operation of the phone.In other words -- form over function.  Give me a phone that works well over some gimmicky new change that no one cares about anyway.  Stop copying Apple, and bring back a real Samsung Galaxy.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"BUY A CASE!!! If you read the bad reviews they all hate the phone because they said it is slippery and fragile!! My only advise is to buy a $20 case and the protection plan! Totally worth it! I bought mine a month ago and it is the best piece of technology I have ever owned. I am a HUGE Samsung fan and this is by far my favorite and has not disappointed me yet. This phone is amazing. It definitely beats out its Apple competitors and if you do not believe me then do your research because this phone is unprecedented. I LOVE it and it is worth every last penny! It will last for years to come and it is built to resist shatters and drops and it is even water resistant for up to 30 minutes under 5 feet of water!!! It is smooth to the touch and is extremely fast!! The memory usage is fantastic and the features it comes with are great. I recommend this to anyone buying a new phone...it is everything seen in the commercials and more. It has Bixby on it and she can do ANYTHING... I often use her feature to remind me where I parked or turn the lights off!!! Amazing technology and great phone!!!

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Actually loved the phone but ""hate"" Samsung customer support.Before you buy, do a quick search for ""Samsung Galaxy 8 USB Port Moisture Detected"".  You'll find hundreds of listings.The closest my Samsung had ever been to water was sitting in the kitchen (and beyond that, supposedly the phone is water resistant).The USB Port Moisture Detected warning pops up continuously and prevents the phone from being charged via the USB port UNLESS you turn it off, turn it back on, insert the plug when then Samsung name comes on.  Samsung referred me to an authorized center who told me that it's a known problem with the software and that it'll be fixed in an upcoming release.  So for the past month, I've been dealing with the constant issue.Enough .......... got rid of it through the Amazon trade in plan and ""upgraded"" to a new Nokia 6.1.Never another Samsung product .for me ...... ever.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great phone in terms of its power and UI... Pretty much any phone in this price point is going to be amazing, and it definitely fits the bill in terms of specs and performance.However, it is probably the most fragile phone ever made.  I have never broken a phone in my life, and I drop my phone as much as the next person.  You can tell the second you hold this phone that it is amazingly fragile.  The whole thing is made of Gorilla glass, which is known to spider crack extremely easily.  Crazy that this design was actually approved, I don't care how strong you think your glass is it will never be more durable than metal/plastic.  Any benefits are overshadowed by the fact this is the most fragile phone ever to hit the market.The design of the phone makes it way easier for it to slip out of your pocket.  I can't ever remember having my phone fall out of my pocket (I am sure it has happened, but nothing became of it IE breaks), but I had to constantly be aware of my phone in my pocket/take it out and put it on the table because when I sat it immediately started to slip out.  I think it is because this phone is larger vertically and smaller horizontally compared to most phones.  I have owned many phones, and this has never been a problem until the moment I put this phone in my pocket.My phone fell out of my pocket while sitting, it was a drop between 2 and 2.5 feet, and it cracked in 2 corners, one corner that was not even apart of the initial impact.  The fact a corner that had no major impact whatsoever (a fall of maybe 4 inches after the first corning hit the ground) cracked was alarming to say the least.  Shame on me for not having the case on it (I literally had the phone for 3 hours, did not make it home yet and my case I purchased was at home)...  However, few weeks later it slipped out again, with a case on, and the whole front of the phone shattered.... Again a drop no more than 2.5 feet.Insurance on this phone is an absolutely must, or I guarantee you will not own this phone in a working fashion very long.  My S5 fell 2 stories and didn't get a scratch. This phone fell 2 feet and spider cracked to a point where I need to get it repaired.  One of the most important aspects of a cell phone is its durability and ability to handle everyday life and people where accidents happen at one point or another is guaranteed.  The fact you have to treat this phone with the delicacy of an infant makes it almost a burden to own.Between the failings of the S7 and the beyond poor durability of the S8, this lifelong Android user may switch to Iphone my next phone purchase a few years down the line

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had this phone for about 5 months now. Now I have owned the S4, Note 4 and now the S8. Samsung is notorious for lag after some months of use. As a previous Samsung phone owner I took some steps to try and mitigate any lag as best I could. I install AVG Cleaner and consistently let it run to clean my device of any unnecessary junk. I reboot it at least once a week! I clear it's ram and delete any background memory hogs that might slow it down. Despite this it has managed to lock up on me at least twice in the 5 months that I can remember and self reboot. There is still some latency but overall it has been pretty responsive. Given the option to purchase it again now that I have had it for 5 months I can't say I would have made another choice. After 5 months it's still a solid phone and in my opinion one of the best phones available as of writing this review.  When I was looking for a new phone to buy 5 months ago I was seriously considering leaving the Samsung line, I was fed up with their notorious lag and wanted something more stable. On the day I decided to buy the phone Samsung had the best deal out. I am glad I waited a while and didn't buy it as soon as it hit the shelves. The price dropped and it came with two free gifts!Verdict... Great phone! Not perfect!  but... Just Great!

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Long time iPhone user that was moved to try the Galaxy S8+ due to its large screen, beautiful design, and deep price discounts. Unfortunately, I had to return the S8+ after just a week and a half because it was unable to maintain a band 12 T-Mobile LTE connection. T-Mobile blamed Samsung, Samsung blamed T-Mobile, so I just returned the thing. I went back to my iPhone 7+ ready to put the whole S8+ experience down as a failed experiment. I originally ordered the S8+ from Samsung's website. The user experience of the purchase and return, compared to Apple, was crude and confusing. I had to call Samsung order support and tech support multiple times, every interaction with Samsung was awful. Everything I was told by support was wrong and they never followed through with anything they said they would do.But here's the thing, as I went back to using my iPhone 7+, iOS just felt so... boring. And the iPhone 7+ design, which I had previously liked, looked so... dated.Now let's face it, Android is a mess. Duplicated functionality, inconsistent UX, and the Android upgrade and update situation is pathetic. But Android felt exciting! And boy do I miss that S8 screen and overall phone design.Then there is this year's Apple contenders. Sure, Apple hasn’t announced anything yet, but with all the leaks we pretty much know that two of the iPhones will continue the tired 3-year old iPhone 6 design, and the new AMOLED iPhone with that ugly notch?Have you seen the leaks of the Galaxy Note 8? What a stunner!I'll wait for Apple to officially announce, but if the leaks and rumors end up being true - call me a glutton for punishment - I’m all over that Galaxy Note 8!Update: 9/19/17 - now that the iPhone X has been announced and the Note 8 is available, I bought another S8+, and this one is functioning just fine. I don't like the iPhone X's look (the notch), the price, and many of its new features aren’t things I would ever use. I didn' see enough bang for the additional bucks to choose the Note 8 over the S8+.  With the Galaxy S8+, I think I have the best looking phone on the market today at a reasonable price (got it on sale), even if I have to put up with Android's goofiness.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased my Galaxy S8 from the Samsung site only because they gave me $200 for my old phone (Galaxy S5). I was hesitant at first, given some of the negative reviews here and also elsewhere on the web. I have now owned the phone for over a month, here are my impressions.1. Red screen: This was one of my main concerns, since many people seem to have received phones with red screens. The phone does have a setting that is called ""blue light filter"", which I find awesome because it tends to protect your eyes from the damage these screens cause especially when used in the dark. With this setting turned on, the colors do tend to look reddish at first, but you quickly get used to it. Otherwise, you can turn it off and the colors of the screen are simply amazing. So I had absolutely no issues here. The screen resolution and size are exceptional.2. Fingerprint scanner: It's on the back of the phone, right next to the camera. At first, I'll admit it was a bit inconvenient, since I had some trouble putting my finger on the scanner rather than the camera. However, the minute I got a case for the phone, this stopped being an issue, since the case border is useful as a guide to put my finger in the right spot. At this point, the scanner is great, it easily recognizes the fingers I have registered and is many times better and faster than the one I had in my prior phone. I am 100% used to it now and even look for the scanner in the back whenever I hold a different phone. So again, no issues here, even if there are a ton of reviews saying that people can never ever get used to it. I actually like the location of the scanner now.3. Size: I had a Galaxy S5, which had a 5.1"" screen. This one has a 5.8"" screen and feels much better. The S8 feels long at first but the dimensions ""make sense"" and you quickly get used to it. There's even an advantage here: I normally carry my phone in my front pants pocket and since the S8 a bit longer I can grab it more easily than I did the S5. I have found the S8 much more comfortable than the S8+ both to carry and to hold, and I haven't missed the extra half inch that the S8+ has.4. Hardware and performance: This is a top-of-the-line phone and I have had absolutely no issues with lag, freezing, quality, or anything I can think of. Videos look amazing, the camera and the camera software are quite more advanced than I am as a user, the sound from the speaker is missing nothing, and the sensors (iris, heartbeat, light, focus and so on) all work perfectly. The phone also comes standard with AKG headphones and they are by far the best I've had, both in sound quality and in the materials used, I feel like they will last for a long time. I also had a problem at first with things like the edge bar getting in the way whenever I was playing a game, but it was a user error: the phone comes with game mode, which easily and quickly hides the edge bar while in a game, so it doesn't get in the way, and the minute you leave the game the edge bar is back on its own. I bought the phone in Coral Blue and the phone color is very attractive.5. Some things I do not like (note: all these things are minor issues for me, that's why I gave the phone 5 stars):5A) Sometimes I don't get notification sounds if, for example, I receive a message after several hours of not receiving one (in the mornings, for example). I just notice that the notification is there all of a sudden. I have tested this and it in fact happes with several apps. I'm sure this will have an easy fix with a software update, but for now I cannot trust notification sounds 100%. Note: this is only true of the sound, the notifications do appear correctly all the time.5B) Like I said before, the headphones are absolutely great. However, they have a quite sturdy and long cover for the jack, and using the phone in landscape mode with the headphones connected is a bit uncomfortable since the cover gets in the way quite a bit. This is inconvenient but by no means a huge issue.5C) Bixby is still very limited, but the phone comes with Google Assistant, which I have found even better than Siri at times. I would just prefer that the physical Bixby button could be configured to use with Google Assistant. It's also a minor issue, since I can always press and hold the home button and get Google Assistant just as easily.5D) There are some web pages where, if you're watching a video in landscape mode and then turn to portrait, the video will not resize. This can be solved by hitting the back button but it's inconvenient. Note: I found that this is true also for the iPhone 8 that my buddy has. Also note: this happens only in *some* pages, most of them work fine.5E) I was surprised at first to learn that there were no tempered glass screen protectors at the Samsung store for this phone. Then it made more sense, since the screen shape does not allow for a good protector. I have bought a couple of relatively inexpensive ones but they don't quite fit the phone or get loose very quickly. I would recommend that you save your money and don't buy any of those off-brand screen protectors for this phone, they won't work. I would prefer to have a screen protector for this phone but I can't have one, unless it's the plastic one Samsung sells.6. In summary: The phone has an extremely attractive design and mine gets noticed quite a bit, so socially it's great. It's also an impressive piece of hardware, so when I'm alone I also enjoy it quite a bit. I have been told that my voice sounds clearer to the other person when I'm in a call since I have had this phone; I can also say that I can hear the other person much more clearly in this phone. The camera is outstanding, the sound and video quality are impressive, and the phone itself is very comfortable to use. Also, I came from a Galaxy S5 and the transfer of data and settings from that phone to the S8 was very quick and easy, and I was impressed at how much this felt like it was my own phone right from the beginning. I would definitely recommend this phone above any others in the market right now.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a mostly good phone with lots of positives.  It has a great screen, good speakers for calls and playing music, and the touch interface is very responsive.  I even like the curved, edge-to-edge display. However, Samsung seems to be emerging as the king of bloat and has loaded the phone with Samsung's redundant software that adds zero value other than to make Suman feel they are Apple.  Bixby is just terrible.  In fact, it was still in beta when the phone was released.  It offers nothing over Google Assistant or Cortana and yet Samsung added a dedicated button for it and one keeps getting promoted to set it up which I will not do again.  Samsung Pay is completely unnecessary.  The list goes on but Samsung had a great phone going until the software team got involved and junked it up.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought at AT&T store at a much higher price; that's a whole 'nuther story!  Pros:  Good camera, fast processor, sufficient memory, sharp display, that's it.  Cons.  It should be said I prematurely retired my perfectly good Samsung Mega (pre-Notes).  So this screen is way to small, small buttons, small type, small icons, small.  The wrap-around edge thing is bogus, just makes it hard to hold without a fat case.  Speaking, tiny thin flimsy and fragile.  The aftermarket is rich with contact screen stick-on guards and robust cases just so you can hold it without accidentally calling Russia, by accident.  Don't buy this stuff in AT&T store either. It'll cost 5x!  Strange charging cord, all my old ones are obsolete.  New Note isn't any better in size either; I liked my old phablet and they just can't be had any more.  You can still get the I-6S+ which comes close.  Really miss my old phone.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this S8 phone directly from Samsung as they were having a big sale just before Thanksgiving, plus they were giving $400 rebates on my old phone (a Samsung S7 I purchased from Verizon).  My old S7 was in great condition, but ... it was locked into Verizon, and despite what their offices will tell you, it's difficult to buy a SIM chip overseas to purchase service in order to avoid Verizon's high cost international plans.  When the phone arrived, I put in a new 64mb memory chip, enabled Wifi, logged into my Gmail account, and almost immediately Google started sending my apps to the new phone.  I spent an hour or two recreating my pages, and then the dreaded moment arrived - time to move the Verizon SIM from the old to the new, and either go online or call Verizon to associate the new S8 with my old SIM/phone number.  But ... amazingly, within 30 seconds of installing the SIM, the S8 became fully operational and was using my phone number!  Easy, peasy.  No logging into Verizon, wading thru their Customer Svc dept - nada.  It just worked!  So, how do I like the new S8?  Well, I could do without the curved glass, and don't like doing without the home button and the quick unlocking of the phone, but ... the battery life seems to be longer, although it's still a bit early.  Am finding that if I'm going to be away from electrical power it's best to disable the biggest battery hog of all time - Facebook.  It doesn't hurt to disable it, as it comes roaring back when you open it, but while in disabled mode it's not constantly polling the Mother Ship and drawing the battery down.  Oh, and the camera seems to be a wash versus the S7.  At some point, and maybe we've reached it - smartphones will have a level of perfection which - for all practical purposes - can't be exceeded.  Sorta like PC's.  About the only thing Samsung and Apple can do, IMHO, is to compete on the basis of price.  Tis inevitable.  Look at what's happened to the cost of laptops and desktops.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Operating System:  If you’re a Samsung user, or even if you’ve never owned a Samsung in the past, I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy S8+.  This phone is by far the fastest operating phone that Samsung has ever made. This is the perfect phone for someone that spends a high amount of time on their phone and wants the speed of the phone to be able to keep up.  This phones operating system will not slow down for you, it will be able to handle anything you throw at it.User Interface:  This phone also has very friendly user interface.  You can make it as easy as you want, and on the other hand you can make it very customization with very complex setting that many people enjoy to toy around with.Battery Life:  The battery life on this phones seems to be incredible compared to the other Samsung’s in the past.  Even with being on social media, snapchat, and the browsing the internet for several hours a day, you will usually end the day with above 50% battery life.  There are many settings that you can toy around with to make the battery better.  One thing you are able to shut off to improve your battery life is the “always on display”, this is a feature that always shows what time it is, which uses unnecessary battery life.Water Resistant:  This is a great feature to have on a phone.  You never phone when you will accidentally drop your phone in the toilet, river, or other wet places.  You will enjoy the water resistant feature of your phone when you are able to fetch it out before there is water damage done to your phone.Fast Charging:  You will want to get this phone with the fast charger if possible.  Everyone hates waiting for their phone to charge, when you really need to use.  With this charger your phone will be charged in no time.Bixby:  The Bixby button on this phone is a feature where you tell it commands and it’s supposed to perform whatever task you tell it to do within the phone.  This is a nice feature for when you would be driving or really anything that needs to be hand free.  The one negative thing about this is that the button for it is directly below the volume buttons, so it often gets bumped on accident and goes off.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Will not support wifi calling (or other Advanced Calling features) on Verizon.  I was able to install the Verizon sim and get the phone working without problems but features are missing, with WiFi calling being a big one. Verizon says they are aware of this with Samsung S8 unlocked phones and there is nothing they can do as all features are enabled on their end.  Samsung has not responded to my queries so they don't get any points for customer service.Other things to be aware of: It really is slippery so you need a case, but be aware that the case really won't protect the phone screen because it will be designed not to cover the infinity edges.  It really is too big for your pockets.  Cut a piece of foam board the size of the device and carry it around with you for a few days.Other than the missing features, this phone seems to work fine.  I would not buy it again but if you must, get one from your communications carrier, not an unlocked version.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I just replaced the Galaxy S5 with a Galaxy S8.  The screen is beautiful, camera takes amazing photos, better battery performance, and improved signal strength.  However I think the texting feature has taken a step back overall but worst of all, the voice-to-text feature is atrociously poor, constantly misspelling words (like 'clubutt' instead of Columbus), despite repeated attempts of speaking slowly and clearly. Also when texting the auto-suggestion and auto-correction feature routinely provides incorrect options.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely the worse phone I have ever owned. Battery life is sub standard. Purchased a screen cover, but the phone has a mind of its own, and the rounded edges make it next to useless to type or navigate, even when the screen is super clean. The phone looks large, but keyboards and apps appear small, and hard to use, due to the curvature of the screen, and the Bixby program that cannot be removed? is the most irritating application known to mankind. I will not be fooled again, never another Samsung product.

The Unlocked phone is literally the best version, because it works everywhere, and you will never be stuck on a carrier with it. You pick this phone, and you can use whichever carrier has the best service in your area. You won't be under contract, you won't have any obligations, and you get the best price. Buy once, cry once, as they say.Not only that, but you get the phone as Samsung intended, with all features (Samsung Cloud, Caller ID, Device Maintenance) intact and zero carrier meddling.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"It may not be the flagship Galaxy S phone anymore but this phone is still a work of art. I've owned mine for 6 months going and it still feels like using a brand new phone. This is partly thanks to the recent Android Oreo update (FINALLY!) though Nougat was still running strong up to before the update with just a few noticeable lags. Throughout the 6 months, I was expecting some major drop-off in performance as a lot of users say Samsung phones do over time. I didn't really experience this. Maybe during the next 6 months? Who knows, but the phone is still amazingly smooth and feels like a high-power piece of tech, despite being surpassed by the Note 8 and S9 series. It's not flagship but it is still top-tier, especially compared to mid-range phones that it is creeping into the price range.BATTERY LIFE: It has been very good, but not amazing, but it survives medium-heavy use with a few ticks of power left at the end of the work day. I normally go home with 20-40% left in the late afternoon, depending on use. I've seen it make it to the end of the night without a top-up charge with medium to light use. It is dependable for a full day of use though not more than that. You will definitely want to charge it at bedtime. I don't ever use Power Saver mode though that is an option if need be and don't really tinker with the battery settings. In conclusion, it is fine with its default settings and you don't have to constantly monitor and change settings to save the phone. The battery only really takes a beating when you use Youtube or play games non-stop. In that case, it will last a few hours.PERFORMANCE: I am an average user. I use average apps like Facebook, Instagram, Dropbox, Youtube, some games here and there. With Nougat, performance was as expected for a flagship with some stuttering on apps that use the Internet. For example, scrolling down video and news feeds, you get some stutter but nothing you would think the phone froze. One annoying thing is a lag that occurs after you tap an icon to open an app. After you tap an icon, sometimes it would take a full second for the phone to respond, making you think the tap didn't register and as you are about to tap again, the app finally opens and runs smooth. This lag seems to be specific to Samsung phones and seems to be caused when you force-close apps. When you try to open the app again, it takes longer to load back up. I recently found out you aren't supposed to force-close apps so this can be avoided by not force-closing apps. As of the Oreo update, I haven't noticed this lag anymore. The UI has gotten ridiculously smooth since the update. Oreo has made a major difference in refreshing the phone's performance. It almost feels like running stock Android. Almost...DISPLAY: This is the best aspect of this phone. I love staring at the phone screen. Regardless of how much older this phone gets compared to new models, the display will always make the phone look sexy. I pick my wallpapers with care because it lends such a strong attribute to the phone experience with this display. Colorful images with a black background really makes things pop and almost look 3D. It is so heavily immersive you forget you're looking at a screen. HD pictures come to life (not literally of course). The blacks are true blacks which really makes a difference. If there is anything special about the phone, it is the viewing experience which is a major selling point because that is something you experience every time you use the phone. This display turns me into a drooling fanboy. The Infinity Display might turn some people off but I love it. It adds dimension to what is on the screen as you see it falling off the edges rather than being cut off at a bezel, so you get the illusion the image keeps going on forever. It's an unique touch that is exclusive to Samsung though it is best to see it in person to know whether you like it or not. Yes, it does create some added glare on the screen in bright light, but the trade-off is something special.Another thing to point out, the oleo-phobic coating actually works well at repelling fingerprints and feels really nice. It has this soft but smooth gliding feel to it that I haven't experienced with another phone. You fingers feel at home with the touch display. It is not 100% at repelling fingerprints, especially with dirty or greasy fingers, but it gets the job done well. Especially when you compare it to the back glass, which is a ridiculous fingerprint magnet. Use a phone case because the back glass will always look hideous with fingerprints....OVERALL: I might cover more aspects in the future but will leave it there for now. Yes, the phone has some flaws (audio, fragility of being all-glass, the fingerprint sensor is actually quite bad for me, some issues with the camera, lack of software updates though we did finally get Oreo, did I mention the audio?, etc.) but the full package is something great, especially as it moves into mid-range territory. I give it 5 stars NOT because it is a perfect phone but because its features strongly overcome its flaws and leave you with a lasting impression that will keep you looking forward to what Samsung has in store next.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Samsung Galaxy S8+ is stunning from every angle. It’s easily the  best Android phone I have ever held.The best display on the market currently.Great software experience.The camera works in every light and takes the best pictures.Reliable hardware and wonderful design, very fast.It feels great in the hand.Setup takes about few minutes then you get a software update, mine is unlocked and works great with Verizon.Bixby works OK as an assistant but you can always use Google assistant and it works great.It is an engineering masterpiece, outstanding performance and the finest big smartphone that you can buy currently.it comes with high end headphones.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like the phone in general its an amazingly dense piece of technology.  One feature in particular I was looking for was barometric altimeter and that works well in this phone.  Ride with GPS app can keep accurate topography on my rides.  I have no interest in adopting another voice assistant in my life though, so the bixby stuff is kind of annoying.  I removed the button actuator from my case because it was being pressed when I took the phone from my pocket or just whenever I picked it up to do something else.  The bicycle mount that I use with it also would press that button.  The moto X touch free voice assistant is superior to the button.I'm not sure that the curved screen adds real utility for me.  its cool but I  think I'd prefer the phone to be flat so that a simple glass protector can be used even if that makes the phone a couple of mm wider.The VR viewer device works really nice with this phone and its hi res screen, and the battery life is considerably better than what I was used to with MotoX phones.  Although the curved screen is kinda cool, it makes using a conventional glass protective cover impossible, and I have now shattered my phone after 4 weeks and this is a really expensive screen to fix.  I'm having a little buyers remorse right now.  Turns out that since I am inside the 90 day warranty, samsung will repair it for about $206 wihich is cheaper than buying a kit on Ebay.  Packing it up to send away for that tomorrow.  5 - 7 business day estimated turn around.  The S8 Active is interesting but more than 2X the price.  Given my usage profile, bulkier and more durable would be an acceptable trade off.Update on the repair:  it went smooth, I was billed as expected and got the phone back in a few days.  THEN I drove off from home with the phone on the roof one day and a neighbor returned it to me in tact.  Just a tiny scratch on one corner of the front glass.Full disclosure, I did drop this phone several times before the killer drop which was a stupid situation where I was holding it over my head to get wifi signal over a barrier..  Given that it is front and back glass, its not as fragile as you might think.  Still, its glass, so dropping it on a rock doesn't end well and the direct bonded OLED + touch + 3D glass assembly is not cheap to replace when it happens.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone for the most part. Broke the glass on the back the first day by inadvertently leaning on it while it was in my pocket. Also chipped the back when it dropped 2 feet onto concrete. GET A CASE IF YOU GET THIS PHONE! Also, I wish the fingerprint scanner was on the front instead of the back of the phone so you could unlock it without picking it up.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Just after 1 year both front and rear camera failed. Hardware failure, and guess what! the cameras are integrated into the M.B. which makes this a cost prohibitive repair. This fine flagship of a phone has also decided to randomly die with a totally drained battery in less than 8hrs. without any open apps or even using the phone. This was my first experience with a Samsung flagship phone. (I was an iphone user previously, owned every new Apple flagship phone up to the iPhone 7 without a single issue.) This will be my last as well. The feeling I get from Samsung is: Tough luck you should have bought an extended warranty! Nice.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought my S8 phone somewhere else, but the #1 issue with this phone is that it is the most fragile phone in existence. A 1 foot drop can shatter the screen or back glass. They might have fixed the glass in later models but if they didn't it is FIXABLE! Go to ebay and search for galaxy s8  screen replacement. Make sure it is NOT just a glass screen protector. It should come with a set of tools to replace your screen and/ or back. Basically you'll heat the front or back glass and cut away at the adhesive all around the edges and use a pieces of plastic cards to wedge in the sides as you cut all around it to prevent the screen from sticking back to the phone. The kit comes with new glue. Search youtube for how to videos. You will have to unscrew the back and disconnect several connectors. If you do not think you can do it cell phone repair shops can fix this phone for you. The kit is only $25 on ebay,  I don't know what shops charge. You can rest easy now, don't be afraid of literally bricking your phone

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this phone from Best Buy June of 2017.  Started to play a solitare game for a few hours a day.  Now I notice that the parts the AMOLED display are burned in.  I thought that burn in went away with Plasma TVs and the old CRT monitors of years past, but Samsung has re-introduced the problem.I like the phone otherwise, but I know this screen burn in issue will really annoy me.  Samsung should be ashamed of themselves ffor using a display type that easily burns in.Before you buy, Google AMOLED Display and Burn in and you will get all the dope on this serious issue.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"A great phone ruined by a dedicated Bixby button that can't be disabled. Bixby is Samsung's attempt to force their Siri-like solution on the world. I hit this button several times a day and everyone around me is forced to listen to this stupid BRRIING sound while I try to kill the app. Other reviewers talk about how easy it is to disable it. You cannot disable it.Again a great phone, but for me no amount of other features can make up for forcing me to deal with Bixby every day.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent phone.  The only three things keeping me from giving this a 5 star rating are:1) No replaceable battery.  If the phone locks up you have to hope holding down the down and power buttons will interrupt the phone and force a reset.  Also, when the battery will no longer hold a charge you are SOL (And this will happen sooner or later...it will force you to buy a new expensive phone even if a new battery would fix the issue at a much reduced cost).2) Bixby...just plain annoying!  The button is in an awkward location and when you hold the phone horizontally it causes Bixby to turn on unless you stretch your hand/fingers into awkward locations.3) Curved glass.  While this looks sleek and ""sexy"" it is kinda annoying.  If somebody is standing anywhere near you they can see what is going on on your phone.  Also makes screen protectors a lot more expensive and elaborate.Can't argue much with the price though, much cheaper here on Amazon than anywhere else.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I feel the need to warn people--do not buy this phone. I have been a lifelong Samsung Galaxy customer and was very excited when I got my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge about a year and a half ago. This phone is a hunk of junk and Samsung is wrong to continue selling it. Do your research (on help forums not websites selling the product) and you will see that there  are a myriad of common problems such as pixel failure, complete screen failure, SD card corruption--the list goes on. My problems began about three months in to having the phone. So much money was spent on it that I'm stuck with it for the foreseeable future. Samsung continues to deny responsibility for these faulty devices and will not send replacements or issue refunds. I bought mine through T-Mobile and because I'd previously had great experiences with Samsung Galaxy products, did not opt-in to purchase the warranty. I took the phone in to an independent electronics service center several months ago and had them replace the screen on the device for $390. This took care of the notorious ""pink line"" these phones get across the screen inditing an impending complete screen failure for about six weeks. The line returned in all it's obnoxious and infuriating glory. Again, I could go on endlessly with other complaints--but trust me you and anyone who glances at your phone won't be able to ignore the screen problem.I will not be buying a Samsung product again.

            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm going to start out this review by stating that I have basically hated the Galaxy S phones since they've come out.  I loved my old Samsung flip phone, but when they made the move to Android, I just couldn't get into them.  I read how amazing the Super AMOLED screen was, and I thought it was garbage.  It was grainy and the colors were much too garish and off.  The UI was cartoony and had weird colors.  Over the years, though, Samsung slowly stripped away the bloat, refined their screens, cleaned up their Android skin, and after all this time I can finally say that they've sold me.The feel:The first thing I noticed with this phone was how amazing it feels.  It's crazy thin, and encased in cool, smooth curved glass.  It has just the right amount of heft to make it feel premium.  It feels like a smooth, elegant and flat pebble.  With the infinity screen it (and its brothers the S8+ and Note 8) is easily the most attractive phone I've ever seen, a departure from the older Galaxy S phones which had never struck an aesthetic note with me.While the elongated shape of the phone seems odd at first, and actually makes the screen more narrow than other flagships, it works well for accessing the entire screen with one hand.  While it's still a stretch, it's more managable that way and makes the new on-screen navigation keys less obtrusive.  Speaking of the on-screen keys, I've never been a fan until now.  They work well and the home ""button"" even has a vibrating ""click"" when you press it in, which I like for turning on your screen and unlocking it in one shot.The physical buttons are a bit too easy to accidentally press, which I don't like, and the Bixby button (which I'll get to later) is unnecessary and makes the volume keys harder to find.As much as I like the design, this phone NEEDS a case.  I don't mean that as a bad thing, although for some people I'm sure it will be.  It's delicate.  The all-glass design makes it highly vulnerable to breaking, as you'll find reading reviews and watching drop tests.  The edge display detects accidental touches on occasion.  The volume keys are too clicky.  The phone is thin and smooth which makes it too easy to drop.  A case solves all of these problems.  Even if I didn't work in construction (which I do), I would put a case on this phone.  I personally went with the Spigen Rugged Armor Samsung Galaxy S8 Case, Spigen® [Rugged Armor] Galaxy S8 Case Cover with Resilient Shock Absorption and Carbon Fiber Design for Galaxy S8 (2017) - Black- 565CS21609 case, which I highly recommend.  There's even a Youtube video where a guy drops it on tile floor and it just bounces, with no damage whatsoever.Software:For years Samsung's TouchWiz was bloated and ugly.  I hated the cartoony look and the garish colors (which were made worse by the extreme oversaturation of the Super AMOLED screen).  But now, with the paring down of bloat, it's finally become useable.  A while back Samsung also introduced a theme engine into their phones and I'm glad they did.  I was able to change all of the default Samsung apps and menus into the black shades that I love so much.  You can even replace the icons with a different themes, although I ended up using Nova Launcher with some icons I had bought for it.I like the way Samsung has set up their apps.  They are clean, usable, intuitive, but still full of handy features.  Probably my least favorite is the Gallery, although my complaints are minor.  My issue is that the pictures are all clumped into a giant, solid wall of pictures, which makes it difficult to differentiate between each file.  The little overlays that tell you if it's a video or a photo, etc. are in plain white text that sometimes is hard to read against lighter pictures.  But the email app, dialer, calendar, system menus, etc. are all a pleasure to use.  Everything runs fast and I even found myself using the split screen feature for the first time ever (I had to do some calculator work and type numbers into a spreadsheet) which impressed me.There is still bloat though.  Samsung has a bunch of redundant features that mirror those of Google's, which aggravates me.  It would be fine if I planned on sticking to the Samsung phone ecosystem for the rest of my life, but I'm not even close to making that commitment.  I still use all of Google's services, because I can use them on any Android phone.  You get Samsung Calendars, Samsung Health, Samsung Pay (which I'll elaborate more on), Samsung backup, and others.  It's mostly not a chore to use Google's features instead, but you really need to pay attention on things like the calendars and contacts to make sure you're using their Google equivilants.To be honest I didn't even try Bixby.  Google Assistant is more than I need, and I don't like having an extra home screen or a button specifically for Samsung's digital assistant.  Fortunately you can completely disable both the button and the service, but you have to fully enable it and set it up before you can do that.  The button is not capable of being set for anything else, so if you disable Bixby you basically end up with a useless button on the side of your phone.The Galaxy S8 has the infinity edge screen so that means it comes with the Edge shortcuts.  This is a menu you can slide out from the side of your screen and run apps, call contacts, etc. with.  There are actually a ton of extra features and screens you can download for it, but in the end I didn't see the need for one more thing on my screen.  That being said, I think that if a person set it up and used it regularly, it may become a handy feature.Samsung Pay is a feature I was surprised by.  My phone came with a promotional $50 credit via Samsung Pay so I was obligated to use it.  The first time I tried it, it was just like in the commercial: the cashier assured me that they couldn't do it, and she clumsily fumbled with the card scanner trying to figure out just how it was going to happen.  I calmly reached over and waved my phone over the reader, and like magic, it accepted payment.  I got a receipt on my phone and happily went on my way.  I've used it three times total, and the first two times it worked, but the third it failed even though the reader specifically said it worked with Samsung Pay.  As cool as the first two times were, I didn't appreciate looking like a fool while I waved my phone around a card reader like an idiot.Hardware:Another feature I was surprised by was the fingerprint reader.  I found myself using it in my money apps, which makes them much simpler.  It's very quick and let me log into my Wells Fargo and Paypal apps instantly, which is convenient for checking balances, sending payments, etc.  Yes, the reader has a terrible location next to the camera.  However, this is another feature that is fixed by putting a case on your phone.  Once you have a cutout for the camera, your finger can easily find the edge of the hole where the reader lies, making it essentially a non-issue.Battery life so far has been great.  This is the seventh Android phone I've owned, and I don't recall any of them getting phenomenal battery life.  My galaxy S5 I briefly owned (used, to replace an LG G3 with a cracked screen) got terrible life but that could have been other factors.  This one gets me through a full work day with moderate social media use, and in today's world that's the most I hope for from a cell phone.  I do have to put it on the charger in the evening, but only briefly and then it gets me through bedtime.  The battery is not removable however so keep that in mind.I've never tried wireless charging before, but I did with this phone simply because the chargers are cheap and easily available, and I had to buy new cables anyway for the new USB C standard, so I snagged a wireless charger from Amazon.  I didn't use the Samsung charger or cable so I'm sure it could have been faster, but in about 4 hours it filled up the battery from almost dead.  This works well for me for charging overnight, but you can't use your phone while it's lying on the pad so it might not be great for other uses.Call quality has been wonderful.  The volume of the ear speaker is actually more than I need, which is a good thing.  I'd rather turn the audio volume down on a call then top it out and wish it would go louder.  The external speaker is adequate, not being overly quiet but not really sounding impressive in any way.  I didn't get any complaints on speakerphone mode.The screen almost needs its own catagory.  As I stated, for years I've hated Super AMOLED.  I don't get how people thought the early screens looked good.  The saturation was so high, and the colors were off, so that when the brightness was up (and these displays are bright) it made my eyes bleed.  But finally, with this phone, I feel that the colors and saturation are perfect.  The screen is super bright too, and in fact Samsung's auto-brightening technology learns what setting you use at different light levels, making this the first Android phone I've ever had auto-brightness turned on with.  The resolution is actually turned down when you buy the phone, which I recommend not messing with.  You can turn it up to 4k, but it's not needed and the battery will be drained more quickly.  As it is, pictures and text are extremely clear.  Everything just looks so great on this screen, I find myself staring at it sometimes just to admire it.  The infinity edge feels good too, giving it a nice rolled over feel when you swipe towards the sides.  The phone has a feature called always on display, which leaves the clock, battery percentage, and little notification icons on your screen even when it's locked.  The brightness is turned down so that you don't get screen burn-in, and I found that I liked this feature, which didn't seem to affect battery drain.The camera is one of the reasons I bought this phone.  I've heard for a few years now that Apple and Samsung cameras are always neck and neck in quality.  In practice, I'm mostly happy with my choice.  In well lit conditions pictures come out wonderful.  Colors are great and they've very clear.  Burst shots are amazing, shooting literally 60 pictures in about a second.  Low light shots were a mixed bag, though.  The lighting in the pictures is definitely brighter than in real life, which is great, but for whatever reason once you hit a certain threshold the colors become washed out and any movement at all causes blurring.  This is a problem common to cameras and is related to aperture and shutter speed, but I honestly expected this phone camera to do better.  Perhaps it's a setting I need to enable, but as of right now I was a little disappointed.  However, if this phone camera is near the top of the heap, I suppose I don't have much choice but to accept it.Summary:I know this has been a long-winded review but a phone is a major purchase in a person's life and I feel like I needed to share my full experience to buyers.Overall I love this phone.  There are no major issues with it and using it is a joy.  I'm sure it's partly the new phone effect, but I find myself trying to come up with reasons to use it so I can enjoy the beautiful screen and snappy performance.  It has a few minor flaws here and there, and a bit of the obligatory Samsung bloat, but so far it's been a wonderful experience.  I would highly recommend it.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Awful for photographers. Notice I said photographers and not photography because I'm not referring to the phone camera itself, I'm referring to the phone display. I shoot pictures on both digital and film to share on social media. The camera on the phone is great, not on par with some other flagship offerings, but the ability to shoot raw dng and edit in phone is much appreciated. However, as a photographer who shoot everything from landscape to macros to portraits, I must admit the phone display is absolute garbage. And I knew this coming in as some reveiwers such as MKBHD warned about the warmer and more saturated colors of this phone, particularly the red tones. Here's where the issue lies for me. I shoot a photo of a couple during an engagement session on my digital equipment, throw the picture on my computer with calibrated monitors and color grade to my liking yet maintaining accurate skin tones to the best of my abilities. When I upload the edited images to my phone, the skin color looks like a pumpkin barfed on an magenta crayon. I checked the images on an a few iPhones and LG phones and they look very close to how they did on my calibrated monitor. This poses several problems, 1. people who view my work on Galaxy phones think I suck at photography unless they realize that their display is at fault and 2. When taking raw images on the phone and editing with readily available apps, which is why I picked this phone, the colors I see and believe to be accurate isn't accurate at all! So my workflow would be to take the raw image on the phone, throw on my computer to edit and load back on the phone to share, you see how the workflow is slowed down considering I wanted all that work to be done promptly on the phone? I will admit that for landscape and macro where saturated colors actually enhances the images (depending on personal taste), this is a non issue. I just wish the display wasn't so pumped up like it is. Also I adjusted the display colors to cool it down as much as possible and the skin tones are still awful.The phone itself is top of the line, blazing fast, durable, water proof, detailed display. Nothing more you can ask for in a phone besides more muted reds in the display.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"There is a lot of great about this phone and that's why it's so maddening that samsung seems to go out of their way to want to irritate you and cripple it.  I just had my greatest of all time S5 crap out.  It was getting unreliable after 4 years and anker stopped making its amazing Godzilla battery for it.  From its hay day the only thing it needed an upgrade on was its camera and be touch bigger.  It was fast enough, a good size expandable memory and number 1 it could have an expanded battery.WHY DID SAMSUNG TAKE AWAY THE REMOVABLE BATTERY FEATURE!  Me and everyone I know think this is beyond stupid.  To the point of not trusting the company at all.  Like a car company that has en engine that can run on its own solar panel but makes the car where it can only have square wheels.  Why do something ao stupid.  I read the reviews for years where the idiot press commented about the ""cheap feeling"" plastic back.  And mabe samsung took it to heart.  Plastic is light, flexable , removable and can bounce a bit when dropped or can be replaceable.  I with the screen could be plastic too.So what to they do.  Make the back glass too?  So smart.  Let's take my expensive portable  electronics and make it more breakable, heavy and slippery!!!!  WTH?  I cant even shop for a case bafore it falls out of my pocket from 2.5 ft high and dents the charging port and cracks the back glass.Glass?  Why use glass? Everyone is going to put it in a case anyway and now doubly so. So why even bother with glass?  And why cripple the battery capability.  I'll be getting a battery case for mine and now I'll have to manage 2 batteries as they charge and discharge each other and wear each other both out.Next is the form factor.  Are we making the std form factor for 9 yr old girls now?  Is that the new marketing sweet spot?  Make the phone bigger but also less useful at the same time.  What aspect ratio is this thing?  Samsung, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.3rd.  Rounded screen edges.  Show me the customer who said ""wow good phone but can we distort the edges more and make it so I accidentally press commands while I hold it.""4th is Bixby.  Yes we needed Google now to extend into the apps more and get more granular so why not build on Google now?  Because the basic Bixby sucks.  It can't get a command right.  And even after correcting it 4 times still can't recognise my town name.  But they added a whole special extra button for that junk pile.  Take away the home button but add a special bixby button, Thanks.Now to just wait for the inevitable moment where I need to do a battery pull for a reboot.Competitors take note.  Make a rugged expandable, practical smart phone and you will collect a very loyal market segment.  Give us a 2 or 4 or even a 6X sized battery.  Let us switch between.  How about an internal micro sd and an external to pop in and out. How about a charging port and an HDMI or dual combos for when the first charging port wears out.  We dont care that its octo core or has trillion by bazillion screen rez.  Just make a phone good enough, useful enough and tough enough to be useful everyday.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"This phone is very fragile, I accidentally dropped it 1 ft high and it broke in 3 different places. It is tough to find a good screen protector that protects the phone and not degrade screen sensitivity. The setting to increase touch sensitivity which was available in the S5 is now gone so there is no way around this problem. The thoughtless design of this phone will not allow you to solve this problem. Either add a ballistic glass protector to the screen which solves the fragility of this phone but turns it into a useless phone since you have to press really hard to get the screen to respond, or not add a glass screen protector which leaves this phone subject to breaking sooner or later. It is as if Samsung intentionally designed the phone so that the screen will break (so they can sell more $200 'gorilla' glass screen'?) Other gimmicks are the 'Bixby' app which pops up constantly if you swipe the phone unintentionally in the wrong direction, and the edge screen which accidentally activates some menus while holding it. So you will have to try to hold this slippery phone by avoiding the front edges which increases the chance of dropping and breaking it.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Samsung Galaxy S8 64GB Unlocked Phone - International Version (Midnight Black)I love the Galaxy S8! This is a huge deal for me to write a post of the following caliber because I'm not a tech geek or even someone who is very giving in terms of technology satisfaction, but the S8 warrants it.  For a long time (possibly for some too long for some), I was quite content using my outdated, but excellent S3.  Based on my research, not only was the S8 the most current, but many reviews suggested it was one of the best phones since the S3 and it is. By now you've heard most of the great features, but now you get to hear it from a 50-something female. Let's start with the look. It's just a beautiful phone. It feels good in my fairly large hands, and I feel like I get more because the picture bleeds to the sides. Speaking of getting more, I like the larger size.  As much as I loved my S3, over the years I did begin to long for a larger phone, instead of deferring to my Surface tablet.  When I purchased my S8, I was tempted to get the Plus, but as it turns out, I don't need it.  The best feature for me hands down is the life of the battery and the super fast charger.  Do you remember how quickly the S3 used up the battery life? Yes, I know this is very old news for the thousands who upgrade their phone every year, but for the few thousand in my age group who hold on to technology devices for comfortability, I think you'll find this information helpful.  With the S8, you will be able to leave your portable charger home because you won't need to use every few hours. My S8 is everything!  I've even started going to 1-1 personal Samsung training so that I can optimize use of my phone.  OK young, middle-agers: buy it, then write about it!
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had this phone since the day it came out. I am a poor college student but my phone that I had previously was not powerful enough for my nursing clinical. I waited to review this device because I wanted to run it through nursing clinical before I have it a good review.1). This phone is a very practical size. It has a large enough screen to be pleasant and easy to use buy without being clumsy in hand. The Super Amoled display is great the best on the market simply put.2). Software and Performance: So we all know Samsung has had its software issues in the past. It is just a really heavy and poorly optimized skin. On top of that, still being on 7.0 Nougat and not 7.1.1 or 7.1.2 is kind of frustrating. They are improved versions of Android with much better battery optimizations. As far as Samsung Experience is concerned, this is a huge improvement from previous iterations of Touchwiz. It is much smoother and more lightweight than before and it helps. With that being said it still has stutter issues. Not lag but stutter. No lag meaning there is no delay response when opening apps and such. But it does fail to open some apps smoothly sometimes. The Snapdragon 835 and 4 GB of ram do enough however to power through everything. I have an app on my phone that we use during clinicals. It has an entire library or medical terminology and practices that we need to be able to call upon at a moment's notice. This phone does not fail me. I also game frequently and this device blows through it.3). Camera: People and reviewers have complained that the camera is just not improved enough. Hmm...thats funny because a lot of those same reviewers have also said it is still one of the top 3 cameras on the market. It is very reliable and takes some incredible pictures. I use it a lot in class for some blackboard notes. Clear as day even in dark conditions. Just a great great camera overall.4)Battery: This has been a very controversial aspect of this phone. Some people have had good battery life, and some have had not so good battery life. I personally get good battery life but not stellar. I keep the phone on 1440p resolution because that is what I paid for, and I get about 4 1/2 hours of battery life. I wake up at 6:30 every morning and my phone lasts me tulle about 11 at night with about 20% to spare. I have had and seen better but the battery has been able to at least keep it's charge very well despite being several months old now.5). Overall: This device is a solid overall package. I think it nails most things but has a few of its querks. A lot of people will be wondering if the Galaxy S8 should be dumped for the Not 8. I would say no. I would personally wait for the S9 or in my case the Note 9. This phone is basically a smaller Note 8 with a single rear camera and no S pen. Unless you have money burning a hole in your pocket the Note has nothing outrageous to offer in comparison.
            "
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay so to start off Samsung made an incredibly beautiful device however next time they should spend more time working and the hardware functionality.SoftwareMy phone before the Samsung s8 was the nexus 6p.  Needless to say the transition from having no bloat to a bunch of Samsung bloat took awhile to get use to. Touchwiz or tizen is not as bad as it use to be but the part I found most annoying was Samsung's very own so, Bixby.  Samsung even gave Bixby it's own button to access it but I found myself always pressing it on accident and unintentionally. When I would use an ai it would always be Google assistant it seemed more practical than Bixby. Needless to say Bixby is still young and has much to grow but it didn't really leave a lasting impression for me.BatteryThe battery on the s8 was not bad considering it's a quad hd bezleless screen.  When default settings(quad hd resolution mid brightness) were active on the battery I would get around 4 hours of screen on time.  When I changed the setting to full us resolution and low brightness I was able to get through a whole day.  The standby time on this phone is also great. My phone would have around 10% battery life before I went to sleep and when I would wake up it's only be at 8%.CameraUnlike most manufacturers Samsung didn't choose to go dual cameras on this device which wasn't really a bad thing.  This is one of the phones that proves more is not always better(more being more cameras). The back camera does a great job in low light performance and in my opinion still took better photos than the iPhone 7. The selfie camera was adequate it wasn't great in my experience cause Samsung software tends to smooth out the image alot when using the selfie camHardwareThis is the area where I just did not have a good experience with this phone. For starters the fingerprint reader.  I'm not going to complain about the placement but rather how accurate it is.  I had to same the same finger twice and I still can't unlock it on the first try.  I am frequently having to unlock my phone with my password instead cause of how many times it fails to read my fingerprint.  The charging port was another issue I was having. Samsung tends to promote wireless charging for a reason and it's because their charging port is not that great. I use the charger that came in the box and my phone sometimes doesn't even charge or sometimes it doesn't even read that it's a quick charge compatible charger. I tried other chargers but it was even harder to charge.  The other bad part of their hardware is that Bixby button it just isn't that needed and would have been better if the button could be remapped to some other function.DesignOverall the best part of this phone is the design. Samsung s8's design are in a class of their own due to those super thin bezles no one has really been able to match.  The edge display just makes the display experience all the better.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Very fast and feature-filled phone. Hardware delivers as promised and easily outshines iPhone. However, my phone screen cracked while I was in an airplane. The phone was not dropped or struck; it just started cracking from the bottom right corner while I was playing a game. The crack spread across the screen and was quite unsightly, but the phone was functional.I contacted Samsung who offered for me to mail in the phone (for free) and they would examine the phone and see if there was any fault in the manufacturing. For $225 they would replace the screen if the cause was not found to be due to an underlying defect.Well they just charged me and fixed the phone. I never heard anything or was given any sort of report in regards to whether or not this was a known manufacturing issue. I find that strange given their recent history with abnormal functioning phones.The phone was shipped to me as promise by UPS but Samsung did not insure the package nor did they require a signature on delivery for this 850 dollar product. Alas, the package was swiped from my doorstep. I followed Samsung's instructions and filed with UPS and Samsung about the incident. One week later UPS concluded the package was delivered accurately (duh, I knew that). So Samsung REFILED with UPS stating it was stolen. I was reassured that this was the normal sequence of events (Odd?). Anyways, I'm now on week three without a phone that I didn't exactly consent to being repaired and definitely did not consent to be shipped uninsured and without signature on delivery. Everyone at Samsung has stayed on script and has been perfectly cordial, but their policies are not helpful in minimizing the inconvenience their defective product has cost me (time off from work, inability to perform work functions without a smart phone, etc...).To conclude, an okay product without the company support to make it as awesome as it could be. Oh yeah, and a company with a track record of failing devices who still fails to perform thorough root-cause analyses on their products. At least with my n of 1.Note: 2 stars because, prior to the phone randomly breaking, it was a solid product.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Weakest screen I've had on a phone. I had a Note7 and the screen was indestructible. When I brought it back to the store during the recall, after they refunded me they started throwing the phone to see how much force it could take before breaking. The store employees were tossing it high in the air and it would fall on their hardwood floor unscathed. They eventually got it to break after many, many throws but it withstood SO MUCH before finally shattering. I assumed the S8+ would have the same gorilla glass as the Note7. Nope! In fact, the S8+ has one of the most fragile screens out of any recently released phone. Look it up. Mine fell out of my pocket about 1.5 ft and shattered, also damaging the LCD itself. Additionally, I recently got an ""offer"" from Samsung as a Note7 owner to trade my phone in for a Note8-- they offered me ""up to $450"" for a phone that I paid significantly more for. This will probably be my last Samsung phone after my recent experiences with their products.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"The phone performs great. I mean really. I haven't had any performance issues since buying the phone. The problem is the curved screen. You absolutely cannot find a good glass screen protector for this phone. If you get the soft plastic ones they'll work but hardly prevent cracked screens from drops. The hard glass protectors will always either leave dead spots on the edges or fall off within a week. Often times both. This is a design flaw if you're prone to dropping your phone or work outside of an office. Again, the phone works great

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this phone unlocked from another source. I was a Nexus phone user and was happily into my Nexus 5x usage for 1.5 years and it went into a bootloop (a known issue). I had to have a phone immediately so bought an S8.Pros;- Beautiful design, screen is awesome- I like how Samsung shows battery percent and data up/download in the status bar- Battery life seems pretty good- MicroSD card capabilityCons:- Screen design (curve) means much easier to break/damage, even with a case- Bixby button is easy to hit, a pain. Samsung has prevented owners from remapping it.- Volume buttons above Bixby button, way too high- FINGERPRINT READER location sucks, and shape sucks too. My Nexus had it right - center back, big pad and easy quick recognition- Samsung Touchwiz launcher is better than old days, but still why mess up vanilla Android? Splitscreen mode not as intuitive as vanilla Android. Home screen has much wasted space as second row of icons goes well above tray, wasting space. I ended up downloading the Google Launcher and that made a huge difference- Camera is surprisingly not as good as Nexus 5x, especially in low light (this is same camera as in Nexus 6p, and current PixelI called Google and even though my 5x is out of warranty, they are shipping me a refurb 5x free! So I am going to pay the restocking charge and return the Galaxy S8, and wait for the Google Pixel 2. Samsung has the name recognition but IMHO this phone is not as good as people think. Google's service was excellent and I'm happy to continue with them where I always have the latest OS and latest security updates as soon as they come out.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been a loyal Samsung customer for many years. However, that has come to a screeching halt. My Galaxy S8+ stopped working one night. I did not damage it in any way. Went to bed and it was fine, got up the next morning and could not connect to any network. Went to AT&T for help, they worked the problem for a bit , it was finally decided it had to be sent in to Samsung. They received my phone on Aug 8. They did not even open the box until Aug 13. I received emails from them that day that said this would be repaired in warranty at no cost to me and that the phone would be fixed in 5 business days. That was the last I heard from them. I, however, have reached out to them countless times now. I keep getting shuffled between repair support, customer support and executive customer support ( which by the way means nothing). I have spent over 7 hours total time on the phone with them, been hung up on, lied to about different department availability, spoken rudely to, put on hold for outrageous amounts of time. Finally today find out that my phone has been ""repaired"" twice now since sent in and has failed both of its quality control tests. Now it is being repaired a 3rd time and will have to go through ""quality control"" again. There is NO timeframe given for how long this might take. I have been told repeatedly that NO ONE there can make a decision to replace or refund a phone. I run a small business and I depend on this phone every day. It has been over 3 weeks since I've had it.....and there is NO care whatsoever from Samsung. Be assured, I will let everyone know that I possibly can about this horrible and unfair customer service. SHAME ON YOU SAMSUNG....this family will NEVER purchase another product from this company.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"So this is the first time I have actually bought a flagship device from Samsung all my previous ones were of the other variety however I can say this is hands down the best device I've had to date.Pros:1. The price, considering the device usually goes for 700-800 USD getting in at 574.99 is a very good deal, this was the factor that made me get it over an iPhone.2. The camera and video quality is AWESOME. I've never had pics looking this great.3. Its super fast like the boot up was effortless and switching between apps is a breeze.4. Since all my previous devices were 1GB RAM and 8 GB memory having one now that is 4GB RAM and 64GB memory its an eye opener plus having expandable storage with an SD card just won my heart.5. Battery life is great. I can go one day without charging with moderate to high usage which is good.6. The speakers are loud AF like I was shocked when listening to Youtube videos.Cons:1. The finger print scanner, this should be a common cry at the moment but its is placed at possibly the most inconvenient place for a finger print scanner.2. The phone is made entirely of glass which for me is a concern cause i'm a klutz so I recommend getting a good case and a Tempered Glass screen protector.FYI: THIS PHONE IS UNLOCKED. It can be used with ANY carrier. I am using it in Jamaica right now and it works perfectly fine.I would recommend this phone to anyone because it has good internal and build quality. So this was just my two cents.Samsung Galaxy S8 Unlocked 64GB - US Version (Midnight Black)

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I have this phone and it is now less than 4 weeks old.  Overnight as it was charging it came up with a moisture detection message and it won't charge.  It has not been in water although it claims to be ""water resistant"".  The bubble gum answer of use a blow dryer or clean with a Qtip are not working and again, it hasn't been in water.  If the humidity in the air can render a phone less than a month old unusable it is worthless.  Move on to a better option because as you can see on the forum sites, people all over are experiencing the problem.  It is either a hardware or software problem.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got to put my phones water resistence to the test this summer. While working on my boat my phone slid out of my pocket, I assumed it had gone overboard and into the big blue. It turned out that it slid out while I was selling fish and went to my processing boat in a bag of salmon. My phone then spend the next 2-3 days at the bottom of a fish hold with a few thousand lbs of fish and refrigerated Sea water. When they pumped out one of their deckhands found the phone at the bottom, threw it in a bag of rice and got it back to me. Worked great, some sound issues at first with the ear speaker but it corrected it self. I dont know if it was luck or good engineering, or both. I figured I needed to give them a review after getting back a working phone from all that. Great camra, good data storage the phone is pretty average after that.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Theoretically speaking, overall this phone is dreadful. Pros are the variety of security features (face recognition, iris scanner and fingerprint scanner) and the option to choose themes. However, the cons definitely outweighed the pros. The cons that were definitely obvious to me were the lack of battery life, the poor picture quality (an iPhone 6s has a better camera than this phone) and constant updates. I have had this phone since September of 2018 and I am not happy with it. Just a heads up if you are looking into purchasing this phone.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Wife recently purchased thru ATT authorized store. She loved the look and feel of the 8+ and at first, it worked great. However, within a few days it stopped working, displaying no network available error code on screen. Problem is, we were at home and my phone, an older Samsung S4 Active, also with ATT was working so there definitely was ATT network service available. Turned the phone on and off a few times, still no signal. Finally, using my phone, called ATT customer service. Forty five mins later with numerous instructions from ATT Agt, using my phone, finally managed to get her phone up and running with Agt stating he had found an error on the part of the store sales clerks initial registration process. Ok, fine. Fast forward 3-4 days later, same problem + phone was shutting itself off for no reason. Back to customer service using her phone this time. It would not allow her to make any outside phone calls or text messages, giving same no network available error code, yet it would allow her to dial customer service using 611, however. Another long conversation with ATT phone rep again who, this time suggested taking phone back to store and have the sim card replaced. Phone was now 16 days old since purchase. Did exactly that and store clerk changed out sim card. Still didn't work. Tried 2nd sim card on same visit and it didn't work either.  Store clerk then erased electronic serial number in their system, re-typed same ser # back in, reinserted 2nd sim card, rebooted phone and it finally worked but only for about 4 days before same problem occurred again. Problem is, she had to go out of town to a funeral and needed a dependable phone. She was so frustrated by now, she had ATT store switch sim card back over to her old iphone 5, which at least had always been dependable, if not very exciting. Thus she was safe on the trip, at least as far as having a phone she could count on again. When she returned home from funeral a few days later, she immediately called ATT customer service, once again explaining her problem. Another 30 min conversation and they now wanted to send her a refurbished phone replacement for a phone she was paying a new phone charge for, not a refurb price. She refused the refurb and the ATT rep finally told her he was making note in file, recommending the selling ATT store take it back. She also called Samsung directly and their rep told her to take it back to store and have them do a factory reset before sending it in to Samsung for warranty repair. Samsung rep was sure that would more than likely fix the problem. So she took the S8+ phone back to ATT store where she bought it, demanding a new phone, since they couldn't seem to fix it. They refused and in stead, sent her sixty miles down the road to an Atlanta Corporate ATT store, the Mgr of the selling store stating he was sure the Corporate store would replace it, what with the ATT phone rep recommending same. Corporate store mgr. was indignant, rude and emphatically refused, stating the selling store should replace it. By now, after several ATT dog and pony shows, failure on their part to do the right thing, my wife had had enough, drove sixty miles back to selling store, dumped the non working S8+ phone as well as the Samsung 8in Tablet they had also talked her into buying with the S8+, demanded a refund for all and a receipt for the returned equipment. ATT store clerk didn't have the authority to do an immediate credit, stating she would have to get the owner to do it over the next few days. Seven days go by with no credit on her acct so she now drives back to store, talks with the clerk again, who immediately credits her acct and credit card for all eqpt. Store clerk admits that this was 3rd Samsung S8+ returned within the last week for similar problems. Meanwhile, a few days later a Samsung factory rep comes by this ATT authorized store, poo poo's the apparent S8+'s problems, stating that it was just probably a bad batch of S8 phones, with no other explanation. Well, now my wife feels pretty much snake bit by Samsung and ATT over this uncalled for ordeal and is in all probability going to change to Verizon or some other carrier and I am sure, by now you have surmised she will not be purchasing a Samsung anything. She's too scared of them and what appears to be a lack of current quality control on Samsung's part compared to their good reputation in the past. Having been an ATT customer for more than ten yrs, she was very surprised and disappointed to learn of ATT's apathy and argumentative nature when failing to back up their phone with proper service after the sale. Additionally, I have been an ATT cell phone customer on my line since 1989(formerly BellSouth) and we are long time Direct TV customers. After seeing how she was treated I am also considering looking elsewhere for a different carrier and equipment, after continuously being their customer for over 28 yrs. Any company and any carrier can have problems. It's how they handle those problems that either insures brand loyalty or causes you to look elsewhere. All they had to do was to do the right thing to start with and give her a new phone that worked. Having refused to do that, what can we possibly expect from them in the future. We are currently paying almost $300.00 a month to ATT for our phone and Direct TV service. Even that did not motivate them to replace the phone, a phone which at the time was less than a month old. We sincerely hope your experience with both ATT and the Samsung S8+ phone is a better one than hers was. My phone is overdue for an upgrade but living thru her experience causes me great pause in considering any new Samsung product, inspite of fact that I have had my S4 Active for several yrs with no problems. I have never looked at another cell phone network provider in all my yrs of ATT service but I now feel compelled to at least see what they can provide.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I am really disappointed that this phone just stopped working exactly after one year. I have never dropped this phone but I remember recently every time I use the call swap functionality it freezes but this time it stopped for good. I took it to technicians they opened it they checked battery and all but no fix. Money wasted.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great phone let down by one major flaw of a super scratchy screen. I have had an S3 and and S5 in the past and this was a step up. I love the display, the memory, the speed, and the color. If it was just for that I would have given this phone 5 stars. I have had this phone for only 3 days and there is already a bunch of scratches on the screen. And deep enough to pick up with your fingernail. I never had this problem with the previous Samsung phones. In fact I went caseless for the entire 2 year life of the S5 and only picked up one scratch when it fell to the floor of the truck once. I haven't treated this phone any different and have not dropped it or otherwise abused it but there are still noticeable scratches and marks. This alone makes the phone a ""DO NOT BUY"" in my book. Maybe if it was HALF THE PRICE but not at over $600. I seriously think that the screen isn't even glass but PLASTIC. A big step backward for Samsung.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best phone I've had yet! Beautiful display and advanced features. It takes beautiful pictures, has fast charge and long lasting battery life. Charged My phone once and didn't have to charge it again for two to three days and that was with me being on it a lot. My last phone was the lg flex and I wasn't as big on it so I decided to go back to Samsung again and my am I happy with my decision. Would recommend anyone to definitely give this phone a go. It's pretty expensive but it's worth it. Great phone!

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not sure if I can get used to this phone coming from a Nexus 6. Since it's a 5.8"" screen and Nexus 6 is 5.9"", I didn't expect there to be a huge difference. But there is. It's so super narrow it's about the same width as a normal ratio 5"" phone. It appears much smaller in person than I expected when I ordered it.That I may be able to adapt to. It's the curved edges that are horrible. Not only do they make it appear even more narrow, but things on the edge are slightly distorted and the color is off unless you look at it dead on, and even then I can see a bit of distortion and discoloration on the curved edges. At an angle it's unbearable the way the edges are darker than the rest of the screen. It's especially noticeable when the screen is a solid light color, with the edges having a blue tint.This alone is a deal breaker for me. It's hard to look at. If it was a flat, even surface it would be so much better. I don't predict this gimmick catching on. At least I hope it doesn't.

Not a big deal untill they received my device and they now say it is going to be 630 dollars to repair. This is unacceptable and I will never buy another Samsung again!

2.0 out of 5 stars,"If you like to be surprised several times every day by your phone doing something different, this is the phone for you!!!I do like the hardware.TERRIBLE software! There are layers and layers and needless, annoying complexity that I don't want or need. The worst thing about this phone is it is UNPREDICTABLE. Today I COULD NOT answer an incoming call even though the phone was in my hand! I had been browsing the Internet on Chrome and could HEAR the ring  but NO INTERFACE to answer. A day or two ago I got no interface to shut off the LOOKOUT scream feature. Sometimes I get the proper interface, other times not! Full of surprises!Bixby is useless and annoying as well, and so is the ""battery charging"" screen. Getting into the phone is a hassle most of the time. Sometimes you have to do your pattern, then swipe past a screen or two then do you pattern AGAIN. Why? Who knows. Next time it might be different!Samsung should stick to HARDWARE and let GOOGLE do the software. Give people ANDROID STOCK phones and stop trying to compete with your own partner. Please! PLEASE!!! If Samsung didn't waste money paying designers and developers to add GARBAGE that degrades they phone, it would probably be better AND cheaper.I think letting you answer calls is JOB ONE for a PHONE.Mine fails that most basic task...sometimes...because it is clogged with a bunch of kludgy garbage software. Very disappointed.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"The phone is fine, but god help you if you have a customer service issue. Absolutely the worst! That's saying something with companies like Comcast in existence, but Samsung takes the cake. They ignore you as long as humanly possible (do not reply at all--let alone in the 24 hours they promise to). If you do manage to get in touch with them, they'll transfer you 4-5 times before telling you the department you need is closed. I pay AT&T $32 a month for this so I'm stuck, but I will NEVER purchase another Samsung product as long as I live and I recommend you don't either--they don't care about theit customers at all.
            "
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Some of these good reviews sound like they were written by Samsung employees or sellers. Seriously. This has to be one of the worst Samsung phones I've ever purchased (I've had 4 different versions over the last six years).  The swipe feature used when texting will more often than not pick an odd or nonexistent word instead of the one you want.  The voice to text feature is almost useless.  You seriously can't tell it you want a comma placed?  On my old phone you could.  And even yelling clearly results in almost half the wrong words.  Both of these features have gone backwards at least 2 generations.  As usual battery life sucks.  If you play any games and use your phone what I consider to be  a pretty normal amount throughout the day, the charge won't even last the day.  I'm typically recharging it around 4 pm so I have a full charge before I go out at night. The touch response is terrible and often I have to hit the screen several times to get it to select what I want (this MAY partially be a result of the Gadget Guard Black Ice Screen Guard which is glass and cracks super easily).  And while the infinity screen offers a nice view of pictures and videos, any normal person that holds onto their phone will naturally touch the side and the phone allows this to select random things and jump away from whatever you were doing.  I'm not an apple fan at all (even though my husband and son are trying to convert me), I just wish Samsung would get it together so I'm not swearing at the damn thing everyday.  All this money and I wish I had my S6 back.  Frustrating.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"S8+ is a really well made phone and has a nice feel when you hold it in your hand. Recommend taking Accident protection plan. The much criticized Bixby is not too bad and you need to spend time to train your assistant, after that it works great.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"It's hard to express how disappointed I am with this phone. The hardware is incredibly fragile and without a very bulky case the screen will inevitably break sooner rather than later. After 5 months the battery is losing its life already. The software is just as bad. The keyboard is jumpy and the autocorrect is always giving me terrible suggestions and sometimes just clears what I've typed entirely for no apparent reason. Bixby is constantly trying to insert itself into my life when I have no interest in it. Apps are constantly crashing and the performance of the phone is generally underwhelming, making it frustrating to use. It's one redeeming quality was that it was waterproof, however I doubt it still is now that the screen is cracked. If I was able to, I would go back to my s5, which was a much higher quality phone in my opinion.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I can describe this entire review as: this will be my LAST samsung phone and no I will never recommend ANY samsung phone.First, positive points:* Camera is great (I personally think its better at taking pictures under more difficult lighting conditions than iphone 8plus).* USB-C connector* Wireless charging* OLED display (minus the curved screen)Negative,* Samsung is terrible about providing OS updates, (at least a year behind everyone else, just pathetic, considering it was a top of the line phone..* Curved screen, just the worst design period, tempered glass screen protectors do not stay on for more than 5 days.* Bixby button is placement is terrible and gets triggered very often* You can't disable bixby button or remap-it to something that is actually useful* Very fragile, my screen broke when phone fell down in a car from less than a foot height (hit the seat rail).* The repair cost is insane, I payed 250 to get the screen replaced at (ubreakifix, samsung official repair center), I had to get it repaired 3 times; on top of it, the third time I had to bring it I had to drive 220 miles (round trip), before everything was working like its supposed to (first screen, after repair microphone would not work, then phone jack stopped working).  The last repair technician said, that I should be very cautious about getting this phone wet as it has likely its not going to hold. I should have just cut my losses, payed a bit extra and just get the new iphone 8plus.Overall very disappointed in samsung phones...

BOY WAS IT A MISTAKE. The Galaxy S8 is complete junk compare to my Nexus 6p. First of all the fingerprint reader is right NEXT to the camera!!! So it's very easy to mistake the Camera for the finger print reader when you are not looking and it usually takes me several tries to unlock the phone. Second the phone only have one speaker on the bottom compare to the stereo speaker in my 6p. And YES it does make a difference!! Third, the curve screen completely sucks, it warps videos and side of webpages and ebook. Lastly as of today, it still doesn't have support for the latest android software while my 6p already supported it. In all honesty if I had to choose all over again I would have chosen the LG V30 or Pixel 2 or IPhone X. Heck I would've chosen my old 6p over this phone. So yes please stay away from this phone, it's definitely not worth the price.

            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Samsung Galaxy S8 is extremely helpful with all the features it provides and while also looking really beautiful at the same time. With its Snapdragon 835 Processor it allows the phone to run appropriately fast, and allows the user to be able to run most programs that couldn't be run on previous generations. With that and the four gigabytes of ram the new Samsung Galaxy S8 allows for two windows to be up on the same time; this allows for great multitasking. Even though the internals of the S8 are powerful, the externals are just as good or even better. The Galaxy S8 is by far one of the sleekest phones out there with its infinity screen and beveled edge. The screen it has gives it more real estate which allows it to give a nice wide angle view and look amazing on most applications. While the beveled double edge looks really nice it also is a very useful addition because it gives you the option for an incognito quick menu.this menu has an ever growing amount of possibilities; because it holds more than your top 5 contacts and your top 10 apps. There is a whole selection of extra pages for your bar ranging from far more than a notepad or a full on calculator which can come in handy for real quick math in the samsung app store. The galaxy s8 has one of the best battery lives, for it can last nearly a whole day on a full charge with general use. It also is very durable even though the whole body is made of glass it can sure take a massive beating as well as its water resistant. The S8 has so many features that its hard to mention them all but it is one of the best, if not the best, phone out on the market right now.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"This phone is reliable.. but that's all I like about it.  It's smooth, slippery, glass front and back, and is quite possibly the most fragile thing I've ever touched.

In the year that I've had the S8, I have broken the screen three times, and the glass back once.  No case can protect it sufficiently, although to be fair I have not yet tried a foam-padded aluminum briefcase handcuffed to my wrist.If you live in an area that has gravity, I strongly recommend that you select a different device.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Earlier this year someone made fun of my old S3. I guess that was sticking around in my head because inexplicably I bought an S8 during the prime day sale. After having the phone for a while I'm ready to say a few things about it.Are any of the flagship phones worth the price?No.No phone is worth this price. For the cost of the S8 I could have replaced my aging laptop.Is this a nice phone? Sure. The screen seems to gather fingerprints more than my old S3, but aside from that I don't have any complaints off the top of my head. The major problem I've already stated. The value of a flag ship phone is far below the retail price. Don't be like me. If you're not actually in high school you're fast running out of excuses for succumbing to peer pressure. None of us need $500-700 phones and there's plenty of other crap to be spending our money on.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am going to review what I consider the most important features of a phone.Screen (5/5): literally, the most beautiful display I have ever seen. At first, I wasn't sure how the whole curved screen thing was going to play out but after just one day with it I was already questioning if I could ever go back to a normal flat screen. It's awesome.Battery (5/5): I put this thing through its paces. The first few days I used Youtube a ton and played a bunch of games to get a feel for how fast the battery drains. To make it short and to the point, you could obviously drain the whole battery if you turned the brightness to max and just played graphics intensive games for hours, but if we're talking about moderate to heavy use for the average adult then this thing will last all day without even making it to critical levels. I think the lowest I've seven seen the battery after a normal day's use (lots of texting, some phone calls, a few games and some Youtube videos) is like 40%.Storage (5/5): Pretty simple to review this. 64GB is probably enough for most people, and even if it's not you can insert a microSD card.Call clarity (4/5): At first, I didn't realize I had the HD Calling feature on. This made the caller's voice seem super digital and weird, I didn't like it. After I switched it off, it improved the quality but it wasn't the best I've heard. By no means is it bad, just not the best,Feel (4/5): It's a long phone, so if you have small hands you might want to play around with it a little before buying. I have large hands so it isn't as much of a problem for me, but I can see why this might become an issue for others.Speaker quality (5/5): I was pleasantly surprised by the volume and quality of the speakers. Don't get me wrong, they are cell phone speakers, but compared to other phones the S8's sound is above average.Feel (5/5): This thing is sleek. I bought a minimalist case for it because I loved the way it felt in my hand. A few times, I had a moment of panic because I couldn't feel that it was still in my pocket. If you are prone to dropping your phone, I suggest getting a protection plan or a rugged case. I have not dropped mine yet, but I can easily imagine a single drop on a hard surface from waist level breaking the screen if it lands directly on it. The screen is supposedly pretty tough, but I wouldn't test it.If I think of more things to review I will update this, but for now I think that's all I have to say about the Samsung S8. Overall, I've never felt more impressed by a new phone

I went into AT&T store and was advised that since I did not purchase the phone from AT&T, some features such as WiFi calling would not be available.  Very disappointed that unlock phone does not have same features AT&T/carrier purchased phone.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Great looking phone but not a good daily driver.  Very slippery and edge to edge screen too prone to accident touching.  I keep tapping on the phone icon by accident while holding the phone.  Bezels being too thin here really is problematic.  Apple has much better accident touch detection.A case can help with the issue but can't fix the really weak battery life.  Typical daily use, I am down to 54% by noon time.  Requires charging, luckily there is fast charging.  They should include a bigger battery not smaller.The new touch screen home button is very confusing and awkward to use.  I have used Pixel, Nexus 6P, this new home button mimicks a physical one but performs very slowly in responsiveness.  You really have ""find"" the home button.  It doesn't just press anywhere on the bottom to activate it.The screen also seems to lag behind S7 Edge in responsiveness.This is not a good phone for Pokemon Go at all.  The battery life sucks and the phone isn't much faster than S7 Edge.Plus side camera and screen quality is great but not a huge leap over the S7 Edge.

There is no Bixby application button  to open  Bixby if you could turn off very sensitive Bixby button.  Butt dialing or pocket dialing is the issue, sensitive home button that opens the phone when it's locked, sensitive Bixby button that opens the phone when locked, camera on the lock screen opens the camera and starts taking pictures.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"BEWARE!99% of the negative reviews are SELLER REVIEWS! People bought used products or from a private seller and got something not covered by amazon. BUY NEW, FROM AMAZON. If you don't know how to shop, I suggest you double check where the item is coming from in your cart and before you check out. PAY ATTENTION!After owning the phone long enough to be familiar with it, I thought I would leave a decent review outlining some of the pro's and con's, as well as some neutral's. My review is as follows: (see end comments about unlocked and verizon use - this phone is 100% unlocked!)Pro's:1. Very sleek design. Very nice screen and overall a great phone.2. The camera/video recorder is AMAZING. Simple as that. I took amazing outdoor and indoor (even in low light/no light) pictures. I am genuinely impressed and was not expecting it to be so good. (See last pic. Photo on phone was taken by s8)3. The pixel ratio/screen size. I got the s8 because I did not want a huge computer in my pocket, and it has plenty of room in it.4. Very fast. The processor even with battery settings set to a mid level (which can be changed to your personal preference) is still fast enough to do anything you can throw at it.5. RAM and Storage ration. Perfect. Plenty of ram to handle multi-tasking and plenty of storage to handle those 4k videos/pictures PLUS room to expand with SD storage, which is also getting much better and bigger. But 64GB entry level... eat your heart out apple.6. Great speaker! I mean wow... this thing get's loud. I was also not expecting such great sound. You will have no trouble hearing anything even in a loud environment. Seriously amazed here.7. Power saving/Battery life. Simply put, the AMOLED allows for some amazing battery life and the 3000mah batter holds up well. Very well. Much better than the iPhone.8. Fast charging. The lowest I have had the battery is about 60% and it charged in under an hour.9. AMOLED screen. As stated in #7, it helps with battery life but other than that, it has plenty of brightness and picture clarity. I also carified in #3 that the screen size and pixel ratio were simply stunning. You will notice this if you game alot or during those 4k picture zooms and probably much more on the s8+.10. Accessories and headphone jack. It has a headphone jack! lol. The accessories that came with the phone are great. A fast charging cable, a type-c to mini usb extension, and a usb to type-c extension as well. The headphones are simply amazing too. By far some of the best I have owned, as far as ear buds go, and you don't have to pay for good quality here. The material of them is great and they come with extra different size earbuds.11. Water resistance. While I have not tested it, and probably never will, it's a great feature. I still don't recommend dunking your phone.12. Pocket settings. There is an option to keep the screen off while in your pocket, or something like a purse. Simple as that. If you butt dial, you probably are not navigating the settings well enough. Keep in mind, android has A LOT of settings, and it would be wise to go through them all including the basic options that samsung offers.13. Widget size. You can actually adjust the size of every single widget, and fit more apps on the pages as well as the default home row. You can also change the lock screen apps, if you want any at all. I personally have a camera and the phone app on the lock screen, and keep all my apps on a single page, in folders, the weather, a google search bar with the mic button, and lastly a control panel for quick access to bluetooth and auto-sync buttons etc etc.. All on one page, with plenty of empty space. Half the screen is even still empty. Thank you so much for resizeable widgets.Neutral:1. Bixby button. The button is below the volume buttons, so nothing you can do there. However, you can disable bixby. Most reviews on here are failing to realize this and also failing to outline how. See the end of my review for simple instructions.2. Phone Length. I'll admit, it's pretty long. Maybe I am just to used to an older, smaller phone, but one handed operations is going to take some getting used to. Be mindful of the edges of the screen too. Too much palm and you will be scrolling. I do not see this as a negative still, just takes some getting used to and as outlined in the pro's section, the overall screen size is perfect.3. Edge lighting. A bit torn on this one. It seems cool, but is pretty much useless. It's basically a notification before the notification. So you would have to tap twice and then unlock as well. IMHO, it does look really cool, but SAMSUNG needs to give us more control over it.4. Always on display. This can also be turned off. I find it 100% useless, but not a negative by any means. I feel it can definitely cater to some users who enjoy always being able to look at their phone. I personally disabled it and honestly looked no further into it.5. Color settings. I have always disliked samsung's default colors. Especially on TV's. However, there is an option to change them to your liking. I chose the basic setting, but there is even an option to change balance which let's you arrange a set of liked color boxes, whites, and blacks to your liking and all kinds of other options for personal preference. It really is a great setting, however, it is a neutral and not a pro simply because they enable a very rich color by default. So I recommend changing this to suite your own eyeballs.6. The lock screen clock/theme settings. In order to change the lock screen clock, you have to register with samsung themes and install a theme, which can be somewhat custom. I did this, and the deactivated my account. The setting were retained and all is well. Still a neutral because I feel samsung should incorporate a way to change the lock screen clock by default to a couple preset clocks. The standard one IMHO, is ugly and not aesthetically pleasing to read.Con's:1. Typical android settings. Everything is always on. This is not a samsung issue, but android. I recommend going through every single option, and every single app to change every single setting. Sometimes, this can take the first week of owning an android phone to get right. This also almost always has a HUGE impact on battery life. There are settings in sub-menu's of settings. So please, NAVIGATE YOUR ANDROID SETTINGS! Your poor battery life is not due to this phone at all. It is due to negligence and laziness.2. ""Ok Google"". This seems to always be on, even when turned off in googles settings. I have a search bar and I have turned off all settings both in the phone and google, but for some reason if you say those two naughty words, it still comes up. However, if you do not set it up, it will only be asking you to set it up. Same thing as bixby almost, but this is a negative because I do not want my mic on. At all. I think samsung needs to address this before anything else, even the bixby issues some people are not liking or failing to change.3. All glass. The phone is not strong by any means. It does not feel like a cheap POS, but it is all glass. This belongs in the negative because most of us are drop prone, and even if you are not, it is very easy to make a mistake. Overall, it looks amazing, but there is no need for a glass backing too. I highly recommend you get a case, and if you are in fact drop prone, get a big durable case like an otterbox with a screen protector. The risk will always be there with all smart phones, but the s8 being all glass just seems pointless. That said, I have NEVER dropped a phone to a point where it broke (fingers crossed, knock on wood).4. The finger print scanner. What a stupid placement for a finger print scanner. Right next to the camera lense? come on... I personally do not use it at all, but if I did and wanted to take a picture, you would be cleaning your lense as soon as you unlocked it. Nobody wants to take an unclear photo because they used the finger print security feature. I like the Google Plus one, but feel that if any, Apple has the best one being in the home button.On a side note: THIS PHONE IS UNLOCKED. It can be used with ANY carrier. If you do not pay attention to who or where you buy it from, at least leave a sellers review instead of a product review. 99% of the negative reviews are this. Please pay attention and buy a new phone from Amazon only. I do not ever recommend getting a refurb on this kind of product, or buying from a private seller regardless of their rating. You just never know.As for Bixby, all you have to do is not set it up and hold the home screen like you are adding a widget, scroll to the left and hit the button to turn it off. This will not remove it, but will stop it from doind whatever crazy stuff these other reviews are talking about. I have had NO ISSUES with bixby, because I turned it off. Also, make sure you go through your settings, including the subsettings imbedded into android like background data usage etc etc and turn it all off. People having battery issues, I guarantee it is not the s8's fault. It is android and you would not get any better life with iOS for failing to go through your settings. GO THROUGH YOUR SETTINGS! every. single. one. Over and over for a week until you find every nook and cranny. There is a lot!Overall, this phone is amazing. The list of pro's, con's, and neutral's are simply my take and my opinion. I do recommend the phone. At least if you are in a position to think about it and can try it, go to a local store and pick one up on the display to play with it, but it's just not the same as owning it. I was torn between a google pixel xl and this one, but when this dropped in price it made my decision that much easier. I did like the idea of a bigger phone, however, I just kept thinking how big it would be in my pocket. So I went with the standard s8 and I am very happy I did. I do a lot of fishing, hiking, and outdoor stuff and 90% of the time, I TRY to keep my phone around me in my pocket in case of an emergency. Usually off, because where I go there is no signal anyways.Any review stating a mostly negative opinion, in my opinion, is probably a bit trollish or did not do any research and made an impulse buy. I think you can get used to this phone and if you are complaining about the things I have outlined here, the only one to blame is you. So give it a try, navigate ALL the settings, get used to android, and don't drop this phone lol! Thank you for reading.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I haven't owned a Galaxy phone since the Galaxy Nexus.I've always felt that Samsung's Touch Wiz UI was too gimmicky and looked cartoon-ish.This is my 5th phone in the last 6 months. I was coming from a Nexus 6P, One Plus 3T, Axon 7 and LG V20.I really liked the LG V20 for it's cameras and the Axon 7 for it's front facing speakers. The 6P and One Plus 3Twere so smooth. But I decided to trade it all in for the S8.I was initially going to get a Google Pixel, but prices were still high and besides the camera, not much appealed to me.The S8 is a damn sexy phone with over 80% of the front being the screen. I like the size. Fits perfectly in my hands.I don't think I will go back to a 6"" phablet phone. The screen is vibrant. The clear flip cover case works well with it too.Touch Wiz has been toned down from what I remember, but there is still a lot of bloatware, which I quickly disabled.I guess I like all the screen shot options this phone has to offer. You take screen shot many ways, annotate, make gifs, etc.Charging is pretty fast and the battery lasts me all day. The included headphones are really good. Can't go wrong with AKG. They look cheap, but they sound superb. I'm using Face Unlock, it's really fast. I have my finger print set up too, but face unlock is faster and more convenient. I guess someone can always hold up a picture right? (Haven't tried it yet) The finger print sensor takes a little bit to get used to. My finger naturally goes to the where the camera is located and you need to fully press on the sensor to get it to unlock.They should move the camera to the corner like some phones.USB-C is awesome.Bluethooth 5 is Awesome. You can now stream to 2 separate bluetooth speakers at the same time (one will have a slight delay though).I have a few gripes.Even though it has a F1.7 aperture the camera is not wide angle. It does take really good pictures and videos.My other gripe is the single speaker. C'mon... it's 2017.... all Flagship phones should have stereo speakers.Get rid of Bixby. Let us just use Google Assist.By default the phone display is set to 2220X1080, which is fine for me. You can always set it to WQHD (2960X1440). I'm not sure how much more battery the phone will be using if you did. I still like that Samsung lets you put a SD card it it and it comes with a OTG adapter so you can plug in other USB sticks too. The Edge panel is just ok. Still getting used to it. I can live without it.This phone has tons of other features too, but I'm not going to list them all. Overall, it's the best smart phone I've ever owned. Hopefully it holds up well over the next 2 years.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"This phone is advertised as having a ""Samsung US Limited Warranty"" and as ""new.."" Oh really?I bought two of these phones on Jan. 31. Recently one of the phones developed occasional blackouts and poor energy consumption. I brought it to a Samsung repair facility, which told me that the warranty expired in July 2018! I was shocked. I rushed home and called Samsung, which confirmed that information. I then registered the phones on the Samsung website, which again confirmed that these two ""new unlocked"" phones were in fact Verizon phones, and that the warranty had expired on July 8, 2018 for both phones.I then brought the phone with the bad battery to the Samsung-owned service facility on Greenwich Street in NYC, in the hope that maybe there was a mistake, but again it was confirmed that the phone was used and with an expired warranty.The phones were returned for a full refund. But getting that refund required repeated phone calls and an email exchange with the seller, during which he initially indicated that a refund was not possible because the 30 day period had lapsed. The whole experience was a stressful waste of time that flushed two days of my life down the toilet.The moral of the story is that you should always check the IMEI numbers before buying a cell phone online, including Amazon. Do so IMMEDIATELY.  Better idea: DO NOT BUY CELL PHONES ONLINE I got the same damn phoneas, brand new, from my celll phone carrier for fifty bucks more each.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"After using an old phone with such a large bezel, the switch to the Galaxy S8 was spectacular. I could not stop staring at the screen when I first saw it. There is just so much of it! After using this phone for a couple months, I have created a list of what i love the most and dislike the most of this product.Pros:-Screen has amazing brightness, resolution and size.-Cameras are spectacular. Images are sharp and crisp.-Opposed to contrary belief, the fingerprint scanner on the back is easy to reach and is very responsive-Battery life is very good, also charges very quickly with the included Fast Charger-Has Video Enhancement and Game Enhancement modes for when you need extra brightness, performance and screen resolution.Cons:-Feels very delicate (easily solved with a case)-Glass on the back so it is a fingerprint magnet (easily solved with a case)-Bixby Button can be confused as Volume Down button, also Bixby software is not the best at the moment but it is a new product and has lots of potential.Overall great phone and great experience so far. Would Recommend!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had my Galaxy S8 for a little bit now and it has been great so far! I love how fast it is. I love the little things about it. The screen is absolutely phenomenal with the curve and screen to body ratio. The fingerprint scanner is great and I know majority don't like the position but for me it works amazing. It fits well in the hand and the cases feel just as nice. Luckily I have not dropped it yet so I hope if I ever do that it withstands the drop that would most likely be out of my pocket or about chest height. Switching from a Galaxy S5 to this S8 was a big change for me and I am glad I made it. Anyone who is thinking about getting this phone, I would say do it. It has everything you could want and more. I was torn between this and the Pixel 2 and they both have almost the same internal hardware but this has a 3.5mm headphone jack. You can't beat that because most companies are now doing away with it. I love not being able to plug in a dongle if I want to quickly listen to music or watch a short video. Honestly, I know I am bias towards Samsung products but everything I have had and also my friends/family have are amazing. They made great phones and appliances. Everything they make is top of the line and that's just the truth.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was expecting something amazing after upgrading from my old Note 4, and this falls short of my expectations. Battery life is disappointing, even with most of the apps ""sleeping"". It's the one thing that needs to be addressed and fixed - a larger battery cell on a phone this big is probably something that most consumers would be OK with. I also don't really like the absence of a ""home"" button, and the Bixby button on the left side of the phone is RIDICULOUS. You think you're pressing the volume button, and instead you get the Bixby screen pop up. I've yet to use it - Google Assistant works like a charm on this phone and wakes up with ""OK Google"".On the plus side, this phone qualifies for Sprint's 1 year free unlimited bring your own phone plan.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazon was having a $200 off deal on this when I purchased, which... is really good for a new phone, actually. I moved to this from the S5, and it's a big change. Overall this is very slick, fast, and high-performing. I like it much better than the S5--everything is faster and more responsive. The edgeless screen made me nervous at first, but the case I purchased seems to protect it okay. I've dropped it a couple times already from a distance of about 2-3 feet, face down and in its case, and it's been fine. If it breaks within a year, I'll update my review accordingly.My favorite feature is that its narrower--I like big phones, but I don't have big hands, so they can be exhausting to hold after a while. This one is just the right size to easily hold in one hand, while still having excellent screen real estate. It's not very heavy, which makes it easy to continuously read and interact on it one-handed, too, even with a heavier case.My least favorite feature is Bixby--while it has its uses, it really isn't that great at interacting with apps or hearing commands properly. It won't open non-Google apps on command, which is a huge pain, and half the time seems to mishear me even when I speak directly into the microphone and enunciate very clearly. Right now I solely use it to turn off the always on display at night, which seems like a waste for what could otherwise be a very powerful tool. It's actually kind of bizarre that it's as bad as it is, considering how many voice-controlled devices are on the market right now.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded to this S8 from my S6 Edge since I was getting fed up with the capped storage capacity at 64GB otherwise I probably would have waited another year or 2. (And sun spots which burned permanent purple dots on my front facing cam. . .)This phone has some upgrades which I personally enjoy:-Battery Capacity. Holy cow. This thing actually lasts me over 10 hours of almost constant Netflix streaming with brightness at 75% with bluetooth wireless earbuds and that only bring its to about 30-35% battery. It then still lasts the rest of the day at 25% brightness taking it down to just about 15% battery. (I normally start charging it up once it hits 20% though)-Camera Function: Incredibly fast focus and quality. (Only minor con is that it's not amazing in low light, using ProMode helps a bit though)-Smooth touchscreen with a lot of customization features within the phone itself.-Being an unlocked phone, minimal bloatware comes on the phone. (Sadly there are some things...)-You can easily turn Bixby off if you don't like it. (The camera item search/translator is pretty fun though!)-Always on display is actually really helpful for me since I don't have to reach over to see the time if I randomly wake up in the middle of the night. I keep it simple without a background and just colorized text, so it doesn't seem to consume much battery even if it's. . . always on. (You can also set it up to show during certain hours in a day.)-It still allows your to insert microphone jacks.-USB-C, I personally like it since I dont have to worry about turning it around to fit anymore. (Box also comes with some adapters.)-And obviously the MiscroSD storage. Stuck a 128GB card in there upon arrival.Some downsides on the phone:-Fully made of glass. It's not cheap feeling in the slightest, but it makes you a bit more paranoid if it does fall. (Highly recommend a good case for this phone)-Wish this came with a non-Edge version. Honestly don't enjoy it that much and causes issues with a lot of screen protectors, but I couldn't pass up the sale on the phone.-Comes pre-installed with Facebook. I don't use facebook so it's just an annoying app chilling on my phone which I'd rather have completely uninstalled instead of just disabled.-Bixby button. . . well that thing is just kinda there. I don't hit it often but when I do it's just mildly inconvenient. Thankfully my case has little ridges on the button which make it easier to locate the volume when needed. The button can become an issue on some phone stands though.This phone was able to hit all the things that I want in a phone: Good camera, long battery life, adjustable storage, crisp display, and functional.All in all, I very much enjoy this phone with only minor gripes which aren't enough to make me dislike the phone at all.(Yes, this phone works with most if not all carriers. That includes Verizon. You can even see this written on Samsung's fine print for the phone. You may need to have the SIM card activated in another phone first then switch it into your S8.)

4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Galaxy S8 is a solid, quality phone based on my use of it over the past month+.  It was a welcome upgrade to my S5, which had become terribly buggy and crash-prone with the latest software updates.  I hesitated to give Samsung another try after so many later problems with the S5.In the end it was worth the upgrade.  As expected, the S8 was fast and slick, although some of the standard apps suffer from usability changes for the worse, compared to the S5.  I have come to expect this with any major software/hardware upgrade so it's hardly worth mentioning.Of note however, is the hoops I had to jump through to get this phone working with Verizon.  This review has less to do with any issues with the phone itself (there have been almost none) and more to do with the general incompetence of the specific staff at my local Verizon store.This unlocked 64GB phone is perfectly compatible with the Verizon network and now is working great; however, the Verizon store employees were unable to get my phone working out of the box because it was not a ""Verizon Branded"" S8.  Do yourself a favor; call Verizon tech support to get it figured out.  After almost a full day of fruitlessly working with the store employees and managers and being sent on one wild goose chase after another, a 15 minute call to Verizon tech support resolved everything.Note that this phone takes a mini SIM card and can't simply be swapped from the S5; this is why I had to endure a trip to the local Verizon store at all.Also note; if activating this unlocked phone on Verizon, they will not allow you to download or install their standard Verizon voicemail app.  You will be required to download another voicemail app/service from the Google app store.  Not a big deal; Youmail fits the bill just fine for me.Other than those few minor bumps, it was much worth getting the unlocked S8 on Amazon for hundreds less, without being stuffed to the gills with bloatware, compared to the Verizon branded S8.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"This phone should be a no-brainer. Easily the most stunning display ever on a phone, great specs, Samsung Pay, expandable storage, and waterproofing SHOULD make this the best phone on the market. Enter Samsung's software. While Touchwiz isn't nearly the raging dumpster fire it was back in the S4 and S5 days, there's still a lot of extras that most will consider junk. Chief among these is Bixby. Have you ever wondered what Siri would be like if it were dumber and had a dedicated hardware button? That's Bixby. Not content to let Google do the heavy lifting, Samsung's MO continues to be creating inferior versions of services already offered by Big G. Want to remap that button to something actually useful? Too bad. Samsung keeps patching the phone in order to force their bloatware down your throat. As it is, that's a dead button that you'll press once out of curiosity, and a few dozen times while trying to turn down the volume. One other annoyance of note is the horrible placement of the fingerprint scanner. There's just no excuse for this one.Overall, it's a great phone that's held back by Samsung's usual goofball decisions.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Really bad service from Samsung. The phone came with a defect in the front camera. I called them and they told me it will be fixed when the phone updates to the new version. I was back and forward with Samsung since I notice the issue. I noted first when I made my first skype meeting call. Then when my colleges told me about the issue, I started taking selfies, I notice that all the selfies have the same black spot in the same place. Unfortunately, I figured out the issue 36 days after I bout this phone from Amazon. So, I  could not return the phone due to the 30 days return policy.I contacted Samsung, they asked me to update and reset the phone and so a bunch of staff to the camera app. After the 2nd call, They sent me to a Repair Center close to my home. The repair center wanted to charge me $109 dollars. I called Samsung again. This time Samsung told me that because I was under warranty they can fix it for me. They cannot replace phones but just fix them. Samsung told me that they will take 11 days to fix it. I expressed my concern that I bought an expensive phone because the service as my work and my business depend on a reliable phone. I told them that I cannot afford 11 days without communication. So, they told me ""Well you won't be without communication you can buy a ship phone and exchange the sim card until your phone cames back"".So, does not Samsung understand that an unlock cheap phone cost at minimum 120 and it won't be able to multitask as fast I need to do my job and maintain my business?I do not recommend to buy this phone or any Samsung phone if service and reliability is the most important subject for your purchase.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is one of the coolest cells ever. I had no problem activating.  I read many reviews before buying it and was all prepared to go through the drama everyone said with activating.  First I connected to my WiFi and transferred everything. Which was simple. The phone walked me through connecting the sub and my old droid. The transfer took 1hr 17m. Then I removed my sim card insert it. The phone detected it was a Verizon SIM and completed update. I was able to make a call immediately. The phone walks you through every feature and it is so simple. Don't believe all the negative reviews. This phone is worth it.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is quite a phone.It's extremely fast compared to our older Samsung S4.It's unlocked, so even when the kind folks at Verizon looked at me as if I was ignorant and gullible as they wondered out loud if the phone would work on the Verizon network, I knew it would (having read the reviews at Amazon) and I just told them to produce the free small sims card.  (Sorry about the lost commission guys, not.)If one already has a Samsung, it works in a similar fashion and a couple of days messing around with it is enough to gain a reasonably good working knowledge of the phone.  The Samsung site is quite informative and I've referred to it several times already.One strange thing is what feels like dueling systems on the phone.  You have the Google Android apps and simillar Samsung apps.  Many do the same things so choosing one or the other is really personal preference.I can't get over how fast this phone surfs the internet (I use Firefox) and how nicely photos are auto-arranged by date.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I waited until recently to purchase the S8+ as my original intention was to get the Note 8 upon its release (after waiting a year after the aborted Note 7). However, all things considered it was difficult to justify the price of the new Note at almost $1,000 whereas the S8+ through Amazon was markedly cheaper.So, the decision was made and I am very happy with the phone as I was in desperate need of an upgrade from my S4 model. I got the S8+ as I was keen to have a larger screen and this screen does the job - large enough to watch videos etc but not so big that it feels awkward.  I haven't spent much time using the camera yet but it is certainly better than my old phone but not sure if it stacks up against my wife's iPhone.I am into the Android ecosystem and the phone worked seamlessly with my Gear watch out of the box.All told, I believe this phone is still state of the art and represents good value for money. I am not sure how much further mobile device manufacturers can go with new models at the $1,000 level but, IMHO, it makes sense to wait a while and purchase a slightly dated phone at a slightly discounted price as you still get lots of bang for your mobile buck!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"PROS:Great phone in almost all regards.  My last one was a Samsung S5.  This is noticeably faster to respond, and battery life is improved. It uses a USB-C connector, which I guess is the new standard, so I'm replacing all my cables.  (Samsung's package includes a short USB-C cable and charger, plus a Micro-USB to USB-C adapter.)Nice display.  This is the standard S8, not the S8 Plus, but this one is plenty big. WARNING:  It's all glass, so I strongly recommend buying a protective case.  I did.Nice camera.CONS:Battery cannot be opened nor removed.Phone does not have ""Wi-Fi Calling"" (voice over Wifi) feature.  Most phones have had that for years, including my old Samsung S5.  It may be up to the carrier to turn on that feature, and this phone came ""unlocked"" with no carrier.  I've contacted a couple people at AT&T but they say ""it's just not on this phone,"" and of course they cannot fix the missing feature.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This camera has been reviewed about 18,000,000 times. If you're looking for some incredible insight or new understanding of how the Samsung SA plus works, there are lots of phone reviews that will give you the incredibly detailed evaluationI got this as a replacement phone for a significant other. That person has one basic need. To send messages, to make calls, and to get a camera that can take good pictures. I have the exact same phone but I have the note 8. I think the note 8 is the absolute best phone I've ever had. I use the pen for taking notes and making quick reminders. I also use the pen to edit the pictures and I have multiple photo editing programs. They require a fine touch and my fat fingers don't work.If you don't need the pen, this is the same phone and does everything but does not have this slightly added size and slightly diminished battery that the note 8 has. Apparently when they add the stylus they take a little bit away from the battery and add a little bit to the size and weight of the phone.Android on this phone works great. Yes it comes with tons of bloatware but it can be left alone or removed. Bixby is a absolute pain and the Bixby button is nothing but an annoyance. I downloaded an app that allowed it to be reprogrammed. Unfortunately, Samsung keeps updating the phone and seems to have an ulterior motive to remove the option of reprogramming the Bixby button. Fortunately, app developers are only one step behind and update the app the minute that Samsung seems to interfere with the app function.In the last year I've used this type of phone it has a great screen, great processor, incredible touch, and the O LED screen is awesome.I read a lot of reviews of people who broke their phone or commented that the touchscreen was diminished after they put a screen protector on. I've use this phone for a year without a screen protector. I understand the anger and hostility of people who broken their screen on a very expensive phone shortly after purchase. Unfortunately, accidents happen and any phone can have a screen that breaks due to either clumsiness or inadvertent shock.And, putting a glass screen protector on the phone will diminish the touchscreen capability. I have not used a screen protector any year, carry it in my pocket and have zero scratches. Take off your protector and enjoy the beauty of the phoneIn my experience, this phone is five stars. Great GPS, great Google voice recognition, great screen, processor works and seems to be able to handle everything you throw at it.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had it for a few months now and while I've gotten used to it, I can honestly say I don't like this phone.I'm always triggering Bixby, which is annoying in itself, but add to it that it's a fairly useless feature and it becomes a lot worse.I'm not overly impressed by the camera, I came from a Note 4 so I expected to be blown away.Accessing camera settings is a pain and it seems there are fewer manual options than with the Note 4 in terms of camera functionality - or maybe I just haven't figured it out yet, but even if that's the case, it's annoying.After the transfer, about a week in, a bunch of my pictures and contacts were gone and it seems the Cloud had specifically ""chosen"" not to back those up as well.Occasionally the Maps vocal function doesn't work, I have yet to figure out why.The Fingerprint function should be located better.Now learning that Droids were targeted with the most privacy issues... I don't know, I've been a pretty advid Droid fan, but I certainly wouldn't recommend this one and I might turn away from the brand entirety.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a good phone with some major issues.First good:--Very nice display and good sound--Good camera, especially in low light.--Looks really good.Now to the bad:--Some of the applications that used to run before without problems, now take huge resources and stop working, e.g. requires rebooting the phone every time I want to use Amazon Prime Video.--Display while good is fingerprint and dust magnet and all these things reflect in sunlight making viewing experience less than optimal, to put it mildly.--It may be T-Mobile specific but data connection settings do not include both 4th and 6th standards for the network, so I had to create my own setting for it-- The biggest thing the phone front camera and back flash (as well as all camera software) stopped working after only two months. After analyzing the issue (Samsung has internal hardware checking menu), I found out that it was hardware issue. It was confirmed and fixed by Samsung center in Manhattan (Guys at ""Samsung 837"" are great. If anyone lives in NYC Metro area, you should visit Samsung 837: great service, great experience and they do not try to sell, they just show the products and explain).

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Upgraded phones with a new phone plan, and got a galaxy s8+.  Regretted it immediately.  First issue - the curved screen means that holding the phone by one hand and typing is difficult as your hand keeps touching the edge of the screen and screwing up typing.  Logged into Google, and begin porting over my contacts.Next problem - contacts show as synced, but several are missing.  As a test, I added a contact via google contact web interface (remember, the phone said it was already synced), and then kicked of another sync.  Again, contact no-show.  Mysteriously 2 hours later, contact showed up.Final problem (and when I returned it and bought an iPhone) - Voice mail never worked.  I didn't bother trying to figure out why, I just returned the phone and upgraded to an iPhone.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had my S8 purchased directly here through Amazon for exactly one year last week. It has been great except for one big problem. About two months ago I saw a moisture warning stating ""Check USB/Charger Port: Moisture has been detected in your charger/USB port. Make sure it's dry before charging your phone. It may take some time to dry completely"". Initially the warning went away, but then it came back about a week later and has stayed lingering on my swipe screen and notifications area ever since. No amount of drying or cleaning the USB port fixes it. It wont let me charge the phone with the USB cable. There is a work-around, I can restart the phone and plug it in just as the restart screen appears, but this is a huge PITA, especially if I am using the phone for GPS and driving. So while I love all other aspects of the phone, this defective USB moisture sensor is ruining an otherwise excellent product. I have even tried putting it in my laboratory desiccator in case there was any trapped moisture, but not effect.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"First let me get this out of the way: This phone for the most part is awesome. The specs are beastly, the camera is among the best in class, the 1440p bezel-less curved display looks amazing, and the features this phone has is vast and actually useful in everyday usage. But while this phone is objectively one of the best out right now, it is also one of the most fragile. The backglass on mine broke within a week of usage and I actually had to replace the backglass in order to fix this. To put it in context, the only other phone glass that I have ever broke is the iPod Touch 4th gen, and I had that for nearly 2 years of usage before that happened. This is not a durable phone in the slightest, and I would highly recommend getting a case or skin for it if you plan to get this phone. Outside of that, this is a great phone and I'd recommend it assuming you are cautious enough to avoid issues

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I already have an S8 for personal phone so purchased a second one for my Work phone.  This one came with T-Mobile branded but just like my other one it changed to Verizon as soon as I put in the SIM.  I have had my personal phone almost 2 years and by far the best device I have every used.  Battery life on it is amazing and of course I tweaked and removed many apps I will never use to help.This phone is just as awesome except the battery life.  After all day light use I am down to 25% with Mid-Level power savings implemented where as my other main phone is still 65% - 70% if no power savings profile. If I used it heavily I need to recharge at least once.  I have tweaked and changed everything but after doing my experiments there is definitely something different.  Either I just have and exceptional battery in my 2 year old phone or the new one has some short comings.I am going to continue with the phone but I am guessing I will need to get the battery replaced sooner than I was expecting.  Love everything else but that is very disappointing.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for a new Android phone and it came down to this or the Pixel 2. The Pixel 2 doesn't have a headphone jack so I opted for the s8. This is a great phone! I'm sure there are more detailed reviews out there, but overall, I love this phone. Smooth interface, beautiful form factor, headphone jack, no problems using all my apps. I like the unusual screen shape, which is a bit longer than typical, which means you get more screen space without having to deal with a super-wide phone. It does overheat more easily than my earlier Nexus 5 (to be fair, I accidentally took it into a sauna so this is an unusual use case) and there are times when the touch screen isn't quite as responsive as I'd like, but it's a solid phone for the price. I've used multiple apps and functions, hooked it up to Bluetooth speakers and headphones (regular and Bluetooth), connected to multiple WiFi ports, etc. And it's handled all of that pretty comfortably.It's slim and the screen is big so people recommend a case. I bought a super thin Humixx case (red!) that I like, and no problems.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"The phone functions quite well and it's performance is nice compared to older phones I've used in the past. Still, the Bixby feature is annoying and the edge screen makes it hard to type. The screen is also hard to protect because many tempered glass screen protectors don't adhere correctly to it. To make matters worse, the Spigen case I bought doesn't seem to provide enough front facing protection. If i drop this thing on its face, its done.Battery is acceptable and it runs most apps fairly quickly. I'm not too impressed with the camera, though it is an improvement over my Nexus 6p.While I'm satisfied with it's performance, I'm a bit annoyed that such a best selling phone gets Android updates quite late. It's not bad but far from breathtaking.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Had it for 10months now, price has dropped by about 90 bucks since then.Supposedly made out of ""Gorilla Glass"" , sounds tough right? Well it didn't survive a drop from my hands onto a concrete floor, it's now cracked badly with chunks chipping off of the corners.  They should call it extra-brittle baby monkey glass and not give the material a tough name, because it isn't tough.The worst problem is that the phone has never been improperly exposed to moisture yet it now constantly refuses to charge and claims that it has ""detected moisture in the charging port"".  This is with OEM chargers and cords as well as aftermarket stuff.  I'm stuck trying to reboot the phone all the time to get it to stop complaining and refusing to charge.  Sometimes It will decide the phone is wet mid-charge and I go to pull it off the charger and it has fully discharged when I am expecting it to be full.It has been telling me software updates are available, hmm maybe there is a fix for the incorrect ""wet usb port"" message I have been getting.  Well I don't know because it will only allow me to download the update over WIFI, despite having an unlimited data connection that I use for 100% of my web use.  I took it with me to the gym and used their wifi to download the update and it installs.  Then it says there is another after I leave , so I use the grocery store wifi and it updates again.  Then it says there is ANOTHER so I go to a book store and it says it is fully up to date.  Then I leave and it renegs and says it needs to download another 1.5gig update...  Guess what, I don't have wifi because I use my phone to tether for web browsing.  And I'm tired of driving around bumming wifi, this is unacceptable when every other app can download or update with my 4G data connection.The specs are good and the screen gives a nice image.  I like that this phone still has an SD card port, I wish they still came with a removable battery like older models. However just like any other android phone I have had,  when I use it on roadtrips with a navigation app and pandora playing, one or both of the apps will eventually stop responding and the phone can get pretty warm while plugged in running that stuff for hours.  This isn't necessarily Samsung's fault, could be the apps. Anyway it often times requires a reboot to get everything running again which is very distracting and not appreciated while rolling down the highway.  Also can really hose you when the nav freezes up just before you need to navigate a complicated interchange.The screen / digitizer replacement is still VERY expensive, and I don't know if I want to wrap up any more money on this thing because it has a charging problem.  Would not buy again, which is pretty lame because I have had better luck with the non premium Galaxy phones in the past.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"** I've decided to update my original review as a year has almost passed. **After following with the Apple fan boy of owning an iPhone, I decided to make the switch to Galaxy as it was cheaper than the iPhone X and I could always expand the storage as needed. Insert a 128 GB microSD card into the phone and I have enough storage for photos, apps, and the likes in addition to the 64 GB of storage the phone already came with. What I don't like when I had an iPhone was that Apple tends to make old device obsolete, slow, or both when a new product comes out. My Galaxy S8 hasn't slowed down one bit or suffer any problems. This is my second phone that I own that supports quick charge (after the S7). I love how I can just leave it on a wireless charging pad and check on it a couple hours later to see it fully charged.Mind you that not all cases can allow quick charge. My wallet style case, for example, has to empty the cards before I can charge it (which is a minor issue). Phone doesn't have a single scratch on it and I'm pretty rough with the phone when at work.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a sharp looking phone. It is the only phone I have ever owned, including the previous galaxies where people have inquired about it because of it's looks. The fingerprint sensor works really well for me and the face recognition is very convenient. My main downside is the software, which might be on Samsung or might be on Android. Specifically, the unlock screen can preview your message as a notification. However, anyone can see this if they look at your lock screen and there is only a notification on or off feature and no way I know to leave the notification on without a preview being displayed. The other issue I have is that there is no quick toggle button for GPS. You have to go into settings and flick it on and off there. One excellent feature is it remembered my wifi networks and their passwords which was always a pain when getting a new phone previously. Not sure if this is a google account feature but kudos to whomever.Camera: ExcellentBattery: So far, excellent. I don't use my phone like crazy but without any battery saving mode I still have at least 30% left at the end of the day.Screen:  Really, really fantastic, though due to its wrap around nature terrifying if you drop your phone and I don't like casesSize: I don't like big phones but this one is okay-ishFeel: Just great and not cheapHeadphone Jack: No idea why it is on the bottom and I think it is awkward if you are using corded headphones to make calls because it changes the orientation, buttons on bottom.Tray SD: Not a fan of this tray crap. Worried about getting it jammed and placing the card correctly. The old system was much better.Bixy Button: Don't use it, no idea but it is annoying if you don't use itAlways On Display: Pretty nice but not necessaryLED Indicator: The best feature and probably one of the only reasons I am brand loyal

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Honestly, samsung really hit it big with this one. Although I'm sure the Note 8 is even more impressive, I've found perfection in the S8. Super fast processor, radiant screen that takes up the entire phone, amazing specs and of course the design was well thought through. I'm living it. I won't be buying the s9 because I'll wait till something surpasses this by a mile!!
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, I bought this phone with my own hard earned money and bought it through Amazon.  This is not a sponsored review.I've had Samsung Note phones because I like the big screens.  My old note 3 (which I loved) starting having problems with WiFi and GPS reception.  So I started looking for replacement phones and found this one.My carrier is Verizon. You have to go into the Verizon store with your old phones sim card so they can burn you a new sim card.  I was expecting to get a hard time from the store and was surprised at how nice the experience was!  They took my old sim, created a new sim in about 5 minutes with no charge!  Very nice.And now on to the phone.  So I was loving my old Note 3 and didn't really expect to have that much of a better experience.. wow was I wrong.So this is not a comprehensive review , just some of my observations and things that I really liked about this phone.  Also, bear in mind I've been using older Samsung Note phones for the past 5 years.  So all the tech upgrades are fun.- The screen:Almost as wide as the 5.7"" screen on my old Note 3 but is taller.  So text is almost as large but with more space for content.  Of course, resolution is amazing, colors pop and this thing gets really really bright.  The first time I used it in full sunlight I was amazed!  I could actually see text perfectly in FULL SUNLIGHT.  Wow... what an improvement over my old phone.  I was also worried about the curved sides of the screen distorting text and pictures and such.  No problem at all.  I still feel the curved edges are a bit of a gimmick but it does not detract from the usability of the phone.  And no I don't care about any of the edge menus and  stuff like that.- The CPU / SpeedI thought my old Note 3 was fast.  This thing is blazing fast.  I mean, everything you do is almost instantaneous.  Now I'm spoiled and expect everything to pop up instantly.- The CameraI've got it set up so that if you press the power button twice the camera comes up.  It comes up instantly.  You can take a photo immediately.  Then you can take at least 1 photo a second.  The photos look great.- The speakerIt's mono and on the bottom of the phone.  At least 50% louder than the speaker on my old Note 3, at that was loud.  I'm so happy with the speaker on this phone, I can listen to podcasts when I'm in the kitchen.  I just pop the phone on the granite counter and crank the volume and I don't need an external speaker like on my old phone.  Again, I'm pleased and surprised.  Phone calls on the speaker are loud and clear.- The fingerprint reader.Wow... It's instantaneous.  Seriously.  You place your finger on the sensor and it's on in less than a second.  So easy.- Weight and size.It's taller than my old Note 3 but lighter and slimmer.  Still fits in my back or front pocket fine.  I've got it in a case with a pop socket in the back.  Drilled a hole in the case so that the pop socket is attached to the back glass on the phone.  So the pop socket is secured to the phone, acts as a handle and a mini stand when I place it on a counter to watch a video.- Wireless charging.Picked up a $15 wireless charger from Amazon.  Very nice.  I just lay it on the charger when I go to sleep.  Super convenient.- SD card capable.Took my old 64 gig SD card from my note 3 and popped it into this one.  Nice, all my books and videos, photos and tunes came along for the ride.So anyway... I'm really glad I bought this phone.  no regrets at all.  I really don't have any cons.  I just dig it.Very nice upgrade from my Note 3.  Highly recommended.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm typically a nexus/pixel phone user.  I got this phone as a replacement after my last phone didn't even last past 6 months.  So far it's fine.  There was a bit of a learning curve for me even though it's still android.  There are a bunch of apps preloaded from samsung that I will never use and I'm not really a fan of the curved edge screen.  I'm constantly accidentally hitting the sides while just holding the phone and it will either swipe to a different screen or open an app I didn't mean to open.  However, the screen is very responsive which is (usually) a good thing.  The ""ok google"" voice assistant doesn't work as well as it did with my google phones and I find bixby to be terrible so I've disabled that.  The sound quality is great - actually better compared to my old pixel.  I do wish this phone was slightly smaller.  I have small hands and it's really cumbersome to hold this.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use TracFone, and was hesitant to buy something so expensive without an ironclad guarantee that this unlocked phone would work.  You have to buy the TracFone Bring Your Own Phone SIM activation kit (I got this one: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0713WH1Y9/ref=twister_B071G7MDJY?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)  Others before me have written detailed awesome reviews.  I just wanted to put my two cents in that if you use TracFone, this phone will work for you.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Was reluctant at first but this has proved to be one of my smartest tech purchases this year! Bought used for under $430 from Amazon Warehouse vs the over $800 new price tag from my carrier Verizon (even though this model is 1 gen older than newest galaxy model). Description said repackaged but nothing else about wear and tear. Be careful since some items may have slight damage, every listed used product comes with a pretty accurate description of physical wear so pay attention! Plus buy only through Amazon, even their Warehouse Used Items comes with same great return policy and exchange in case something goes wrong.My phone arrived timely and came repackaged with all accessories. Looks and feels completely brand new! Have been using it all week and it has been working fantastic! Took 10-15 mins to figure out how to transfer service from my old LG phone to this S8 and works flawlessly on my Verizon.Was even able to register warranty on Samsung's official site until next year. Great deal and saved me over $400 from buying new from my phone carrier. Thanks Amazon Warehouse!
            "
3.0 out of 5 stars,"So I've owned a Pixil for a couple of years and then put it the washing machine.  Oops. I initially bought the S8, having visited a phone store and really liked the display. It's quite vibrant. However, in accustoming myself to the phone I had problems with ""Hi, Bixby"". Bixby is a 2nd AI on the phone designed to work and perform phone tasks. The 1st AI is ""Ok, Google"". One phone, two AI's and I never found out if they talk to each other. There are 10 levels to Hi, Bixby and I never got past level 3. Another problem was the news feed (which will probably not bother others as it did me) but every headline in the news feed was on top of a photo, so I had to process a picture as well as read a headline printed over variable colors. Add to that, instead of the feed being one box over another box it is in a hop-scotch format: one box over two side-by-side boxes over one box over two side-by-side boxes over....So my eyes have to jump all over the place to read a headline. Too much effort was required by me to read a line. The last problem I couldn't get over was the alarm volume. Can't get to the volume slide without setting an alarm to go off. The slide does not show up in the drop down menu for volume control. Nowhere could I find it in settings. And for the two daily alarms I have, lowering the volume doesn't remain low. It always went back to a default level. So I have returned this phone and got another Pixil.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this phone as an upgrade for my HTC M9 that was getting long in the tooth and wasn’t a good value as a trade in. I was going to go for a Hauwei Mate SE,  but research showed that it may not be a good match for my Samsung Gear S3 running Samsung Tizen software. Since I'm accustomed to the watch which played well with the M9, I spent the extra on the used S8 plus. Thankfully it arrived in near new condition and has worked flawlessly so far at a substantial discount for a larger size, high quality product with reasonable up to date specs, while I get to keep the full functionality of my watch. The Tizen thing kind of sucks since I did get a Mate SE for my wife and it’s a great upgrade option to her M9 and she gets a brand new phone vs a used Samsung, Apple or other top tier phone, even if it’s more of a midrange phone.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I didn't want to spend a thousand dollars, nor did I want to wait to see what the Galaxy 10 had to offer.  This S8 has all the features of a great smartphone, came unlocked so I can use it anywhere in the world, and at a price half that of an iPhone or the S10.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I just discovered that the Samsung Galaxy S8+ phone I bought in early October from Mercate is a dummy phone used for display.  I also received 3 iPhone chargers with this ""phone."" I paid $549 for an alleged phone that is empty inside. Why so long to discover I've been ripped off? I am the full-time caregiver for my 98 y/o mother with little time for myself. I went online & watched YouTube repeatedly trying to get the phone open. I purchased a charger. I couldn't believe I had been ripped off until yesterday when a technician opened the "" phone"" & I saw it was empty inside.  I am retired & not wealthy & sick to realize I might have given Mercate $549 for nothing.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Samsung Galaxy S8 Unlocked 64GB - US Version (Midnight Black) - US WarrantyTook a little bit of finagling to get the phone activated via. Verizon called to get sim card shipped, then had to turn off Family Base because it is a carrier-based product.  After researching found this is common with unlocked phones.  But once that was done, phone active and running flawlessly so far.  Big jump from S5 this phone replaced.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had three different iPhones but I have been disappointed in the direction Apple has done with the hardware of the newer phones and price.  I really I'm glad I made the switch and Samsung Galaxy 8+ phone six months in is working great. My only complaint is the Bixby button is worthless and causes you issues at times when you meant to only change the volume.  Speaking of volume the external speaker is not all that great but I usually use head phones so no worries. Honestly I can do everything I did on the iPhone and more with the Samsung oh and I never have to worry about memory something Apple is pathetic in pricing as well.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"My phone arrived yesterday afternoon. I was able to copy the data from my old phone to this one without any problems. I wasn't able to activate it for my provider - Metropcs. I had to go a store and the employee did that for me. All in all, the phone is working fine without any headaches that I was experiencing with my previous device. We won't mention the name of the company that sells this item.  The phone is much easier to work with, almost like an iPhone. I have had one in the past. This phone has lots of memory, so feel free to download all the apps you need! I may update this review if necessary. For now, I'm very satisfied with this phone.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing phone. Just about every thing of this phone is better than the top end of iPhones. Better screen. More memory. Expansion slot. Better form. +Fingerprint sensor. Great iris sensor, and a good face detection. Better software controls because unlike iOS, android gives you a lot of control over so many aspects of user experience.I used to be an iPhone user for many years but finally got bored of the lackluster hardware, and being dictated what I should want from my phone. I use a standard ear phones, and expect my phone to honor my wishes.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The screen is incredible.  One of the best Android phones out there if not the best.  Camera is great in low light situations.  Battery life is good and lasts me the whole day.  Also has a quick charging feature if you use supported Qualcomm quick charge adapters.  Only thing that annoys me is the Bixby feature.  I basically have disabled it and switched over to the Google Assistant.  Default Samsung applications for basic smart phone use are very good and minimalistic.  For example the calendaring, contacts, and messaging apps all support the basic needed functionality well.  Best thing though is the screen when you are watching HighDef video content or viewing your photos.  Really clear when you've got the right content.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Switched from an iPhone 8 plus and have not been able to put it down. Beats the iPhone in every way. The radio reception is amazing as well. That goes for the cellular, wifi, bluetooth and gps. Such an awesome phone. It just works and the battery life is amazing. Samsung has done some nice touches to android. I love how bixby can help you optimize your phone for better battery life and clear the ram and cash. The build quality of this thing is amazing. Even beats apple. I would even recommend this phone in 2018. Yeah the S9 is coming but if you don't want the latest and greatest this phone is really worth a look.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've only had the phone for a few hours, but I can confirm that it CAN be activated on Verizon.  I bought 2 phones, went into my local store to get one of them activated.  The clerk provided a SIM card and got it running in just a few minutes (but be prepared to spend two or three hours reloading your apps and configuring the phone's options).Waited to set up my second phone until my wife got home this evening.  I was planning on doing it myself online, but had a minor issue finding the right numbers on the phone itself (the online tool wasn't accepting the numbers).  I used Verizon's online chat, and the operator had it up and running in just a few minutes.  No problems.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"As good as they say, far as I can tell. Very responsive, good storage capacity, The UI is good, cameras are outstanding compared to the average phone. The fingerprint scanner's position next to the camera is not so hard to get used to, and there's a biometric scanner as well if you're interested in health readings like heart rate and blood oxygen saturation. Preloaded apps aren't intrusive, and don't clutter the system much.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Only my 2nd day, but I think it's as expected.  The phone arrived in what appeared to be a new box, I swapped the SIM, but the phone didn't ask the expected start up questions. My AT&T GO plan connected immediately on it's own. So I logged into my gmail account to establish the protection I read about and then took it to the AT&T store to reset to factory default. Process was easy to reset, and then the phone started asking all the startup questions. So I think I'm happy.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far I love it.... After months of listening to my family tell me to retire my NEXUS 6 - Amazon made it easy [price-wise] for me to do just that. e phone is way smaller - something I have to get used to, but lightening quick with responses.  The camera is great..I've only had it for 2 days, but it is pretty neat - so far.  Pairs effortlessly with my car stereo and has many 'modern' features.... So far, so good...LOL  If I should fall out of love with it - I will share that, too!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"No issues connecting to Verizon aside from a little difficulty fitting the SIM card from my old phone into the caddy that pops out of the bottom of the S8+--a tight fit!  Once inserted, the phone fired up immediately with no red Verizon screen on startup any more.  From there, no problems making calls and texting.  Would definitely buy again, though I wish someone would make a Verizon compatible phone with an even larger screen (7.0""+....anyone...anyone....?)

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome phone, I have seen some people say they got ripped off or not everything was in the box. You have to buy it from Amazon not another seller, that's what I did and it was brand new. Phone is really nice bit screen but it's thinner than most phones in a good way. No negative complaints so far. Had a few galaxies in the past and iPhones I switch every other phone between the two companies and this is probably the best galaxy yet I would say, the bixby button is annoying though.
            "
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great. Only problem I ran into was not knowing that this phone uses a nano sim instead of a micro sim, so I had to convert my sim card to the smaller size. I cut it down with scissors and it did the job. If you don't feel confident in your cutting abilities, you can go to a cell phone shop and ask them to cut it down for you. Phone is fast and was easy to set up. Works well with T-mobile.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"This phone was not unlocked! Took it to Verizon and the tech could not get the SIM to activate. He tried 10 different cards so the problem was with the phone. I read other reviews that said the same thing.  HOWEVER...there is a workaround! He had to put the SIM in another new phone, activate it, and then switch it to my phone. So glad it worked because I really like this phone and it was a lot cheaper than buying a new S9.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"My problem with buying a phone from a carrier has been after a few years, support for security updates were up to the provider.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't like how ever since I've gotten this it constantly closes apps without me actually closing it. It glitches, so I'm factory resetting the phone in order just to use it. Resetting only works for about an hour. I got 65 gigs of space but when I add more apps or even photos it gets extremely slow. It would be better if I just got the 16 gigs. I have been downloading multiple apps to speed it up or take off viruses. They dont work well. Maybe I'm miss using but using this phone gets me frustrated.  I thought about giving it a few months just to fully get into the phone and I havent been able to stop the app closing and the glitching. I got more space than a 16 gig to use, not just to say I have 65 gigs of space.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"This has to be the worst phone I have ever bought. I bought it in April of 2018.I have never had a Samsung phone before this one. I would rather use a flip phone than this.  Picture quality looks like a 1mp camera. Apps stay running after they are closed. Constantly restarting the phone because it won't pick up on wifi. After it restarts your good for a day or two. Everything looks good on paper but placing it in the real world is totally different.

It constantly feels like your fighting with what Samsung likes to call ""The Samsung User Experience"".
